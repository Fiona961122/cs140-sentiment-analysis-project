IRS targets Obama\u2019s enemies:\u00a0The IRS targeted conservative and pro-Israel groups prior to the 2012 election. Questions are being raised about why this occurred  who ordered it  whether there was any White House involvement and whether there was an initial effort to hide who knew about the targeting and when.2.\u00a0Benghazi:\u00a0This is actually three scandals in one: The failure of administration to protect the Benghazi mission; the changes made to the talking points in order to suggest the attack was motivated by an anti-Muslim video; and the refusal of the White House to say what President\u00a0Obama\u00a0did the night of the attack.3. Keeping an eye on\u00a0The Associated Press:\u00a0The Justice Department performed a massive cull of Associated Press reporters\u2019 phone records as part of a leak investigation.\u00a0 4. Rosengate:\u00a0The Justice Department suggested that\u00a0Fox News\u00a0reporter James Rosen is a criminal for reporting about classified information and subsequently monitored his phones and emails.5. Potential Holder perjury I:\u00a0Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress he had never been associated with \u201cpotential prosecution\u201d of a journalist for perjury when in fact he signed the affidavit that termed Rosen a potential criminal.6. The ATF \u201cFast and Furious\u201d scheme:\u00a0Federal agencies allowed weapons from U.S. gun dealers to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into the hands of Mexican drug dealers. The ATF summarily lost track of scores of those weapons  many of which were used in crimes  including the December 2010 killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.7. Potential Holder perjury II:\u00a0Holder told Congress in May 2011 that he had just recently heard about the Fast and Furious gun walking scheme when there is evidence he may have known much earlier.8. Sebelius demands payment:\u00a0HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius solicited donations from companies HHS might regulate. The money would be used to help her sign up uninsured Americans for Obamacare.9. The Pigford scandal:\u00a0An Agriculture Department effort that started as an attempt to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency but evolved into a gravy train delivering several billion dollars in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who probably didn\u2019t face discrimination.10. GSA gone wild:\u00a0The\u00a0General Services Administration\u00a0in 2010 held an $823 000 training conference in Las Vegas  featuring a clown and a mind readers. Resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator.11. Veterans Affairs in Disney World:\u00a0The agency wasted more than $6 million on two conferences in Orlando. An assistant secretary was fired.12. Sebelius violates the Hatch Act:\u00a0A U.S. special counsel determined that Sebelius violated the Hatch Act when she made \u201cextemporaneous partisan remarks\u201d during a speech in her official capacity last year. During the remarks  Sebelius called for the election of the Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina.13. Solyndra:\u00a0Republicans charged the Obama Administration funded and promoted its poster boy for green energy despite warning signs the company was headed for bankruptcy. The administration also allegedly pressed Solyndra to delay layoff announcements until after the 2010 midterm elections.14. AKA Lisa Jackson:\u00a0Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used the name \u201cRichard Windsor\u201d when corresponding by email with other government officials  drawing charges she was trying to evade scrutiny.15. The New Black Panthers:\u00a0The Justice Department was accused of using a racial double standard in failing to pursue a voter intimidation case against Black Panthers who appeared to be menacing voters at a polling place in 2008 in Philadelphia.16. Waging war all by myself:\u00a0Obama may have violated the Constitution and both the letter and the spirit of the War Powers Resolution by attacking Libya without Congressional approval.17. Biden bullies the press:\u00a0Vice President Biden\u2019s office has repeatedly interfered with coverage  including forcing a reporter to wait in a closet  making a reporter delete photos  and editing pool reports.18. AKPD not A-OK:\u00a0The administration paid millions to the former firm of then-White House adviser David Axelrod  AKPD Message and Media  to promote passage of Obamacare. Some questioned whether the firm was hired to help pay Axelrod $2 million AKPD owed him.19. Sestak  we\u2019ll take care of you:\u00a0Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used Bill Clinton as an intermediary to probe whether former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.) would accept a prominent  unpaid White House advisory position in exchange for dropping out of the 2010 primary against former Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).20. I\u2019ll pass my own laws:\u00a0Obama has repeatedly been accused of making end runs around Congress by deciding which laws to enforce  including the decision not to deport illegal immigrants who may have been allowed to stay in the United States had Congress passed the \u201cDream Act.\u201d*\" ", "2019-06-02T15:15:02.000Z": "Left Hand I seriously feel like there is enough repetition in this comment section to justify strong suspicion of Russian troll activity ", "2019-04-30T03:55:27.000Z": "Gypsy thehoneybee \"VP Joe Biden has always through his career worked hard for Fire Fighters and Law Enforcement....supporting our First Responders our hero's  who work hard saving us every day.

They knew it\u2019s easy to get swept up in the glamour & excitement of politics  and make a feverish mistake. There needed to be a mechanism to keep unfit individuals out of the Presidency without precipitating a Constitutional crisis. That\u2019s the Electoral College\u2019s *administrative* purpose.     Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution explicitly made Electors independent actors. They\u2019re honor-bound to assess the sense of the people they represent, and to cast their vote in \u201ca free and fair expression of the public will\u201d. Practically speaking, if their district votes GOP, they need to pick a GOP candidate. But it\u2019s also their responsibility to act as a safety catch. If the populace picks someone blatantly unfit, the loyal Elector is supposed to vote for a fit alternative whose policies and person still represent their public\u2019s will. (The biggest 2016 alternative to Donald Trump were Colin Powell, who received 3 electoral votes.)    There\u2019s a difference between the system\u2019s fault and the failure to execute it correctly. So many GOP Electors who expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s fitness punted on their responsibility, telling the newspapers at the time their job was to rubber-stamp the people\u2019s decision. No, it\u2019s not. The electoral system made the Republican candidate the winner, but the failure of Electors to do their jobs made that Republican Donald Trump.

And Pelosi turned out to be the perfect person to confront Trump. I don't believe any other Speaker could have checked Trump like Nancy has done.

Meantime  a crook sits in the White House who had over 23 women recount sexual misconduct. Let me sort this out: A kiss on one side  a pussy grabber on the other. Seems a tad disaparate to me  some how. Let's revisit a couple of Trump's accusers out of those 23  just to put a scale to this:    Jessica Leeds told the New York Times in October 2016 that Trump reached his hand up her skirt and groped her while seated next to her on a flight in the late 1970s.    Kristin Anderson, a photographer and former model said Trump reached under her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear at a New York City nightclub in the early 1990s.    Jill Harth, a businesswoman who worked with Trump in the 1990s, told the Guardian in July 2016 that Trump pushed her against a wall, put his hand up her skirt, and tried to kiss her at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 1990s.    Lisa Boyne, a health food business entrepreneur, said in 1996 that Trump looked up their skirts and commented on their underwear and genitals. Trump allegedly asked Boyne for her opinion on which of the women he should sleep with.    And then there's the \"\"weird uncle\"\":  Two Miss Teen USA contestants told BuzzFeed News in October 2016 that Trump walked in on them while they were changing in their dressing rooms.  \"\"I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, 'Oh my god, there's a man in here,'\"\" Mariah Billado, who represented Vermont in 1997, told BuzzFeed. Billado added that Trump said something along the lines of, \"\"Don't worry, ladies, I've seen it all before.\"\"  Victoria Hughes, a former Miss New Mexico, said Trump first introduced himself to the teenage contestants when he unexpectedly walked into their dressing room.  Trump appeared to admit to this behavior when he boasted in an April 2005 interview with radio host Howard Stern that he regularly walked into contestants' dressing rooms on the beauty pageants he owned while women were unclothed.    That's just Trump's tip of the iceberg, between all the golden showers with Russian hookers and coming on to teens.

But it cannot survive treason from within.   An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly.   But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys,   heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor;   he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments,   he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation,   he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city,   he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.\"\"\" ", "qistina yusri": "Joe Biden\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f May God Bless You On What Are You Doing..

IRS targets Obama\u2019s enemies:\u00a0The IRS targeted conservative and pro-Israel groups prior to the 2012 election. Questions are being raised about why this occurred  who ordered it  whether there was any White House involvement and whether there was an initial effort to hide who knew about the targeting and when.2.\u00a0Benghazi:\u00a0This is actually three scandals in one: The failure of administration to protect the Benghazi mission; the changes made to the talking points in order to suggest the attack was motivated by an anti-Muslim video; and the refusal of the White House to say what President\u00a0Obama\u00a0did the night of the attack.3. Keeping an eye on\u00a0The Associated Press:\u00a0The Justice Department performed a massive cull of Associated Press reporters\u2019 phone records as part of a leak investigation.\u00a0 4. Rosengate:\u00a0The Justice Department suggested that\u00a0Fox News\u00a0reporter James Rosen is a criminal for reporting about classified information and subsequently monitored his phones and emails.5. Potential Holder perjury I:\u00a0Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress he had never been associated with \u201cpotential prosecution\u201d of a journalist for perjury when in fact he signed the affidavit that termed Rosen a potential criminal.6. The ATF \u201cFast and Furious\u201d scheme:\u00a0Federal agencies allowed weapons from U.S. gun dealers to \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into the hands of Mexican drug dealers. The ATF summarily lost track of scores of those weapons  many of which were used in crimes  including the December 2010 killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.7. Potential Holder perjury II:\u00a0Holder told Congress in May 2011 that he had just recently heard about the Fast and Furious gun walking scheme when there is evidence he may have known much earlier.8. Sebelius demands payment:\u00a0HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius solicited donations from companies HHS might regulate. The money would be used to help her sign up uninsured Americans for Obamacare.9. The Pigford scandal:\u00a0An Agriculture Department effort that started as an attempt to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency but evolved into a gravy train delivering several billion dollars in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who probably didn\u2019t face discrimination.10. GSA gone wild:\u00a0The\u00a0General Services Administration\u00a0in 2010 held an $823 000 training conference in Las Vegas  featuring a clown and a mind readers. Resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator.11. Veterans Affairs in Disney World:\u00a0The agency wasted more than $6 million on two conferences in Orlando. An assistant secretary was fired.12. Sebelius violates the Hatch Act:\u00a0A U.S. special counsel determined that Sebelius violated the Hatch Act when she made \u201cextemporaneous partisan remarks\u201d during a speech in her official capacity last year. During the remarks  Sebelius called for the election of the Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina.13. Solyndra:\u00a0Republicans charged the Obama Administration funded and promoted its poster boy for green energy despite warning signs the company was headed for bankruptcy. The administration also allegedly pressed Solyndra to delay layoff announcements until after the 2010 midterm elections.14. AKA Lisa Jackson:\u00a0Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used the name \u201cRichard Windsor\u201d when corresponding by email with other government officials  drawing charges she was trying to evade scrutiny.15. The New Black Panthers:\u00a0The Justice Department was accused of using a racial double standard in failing to pursue a voter intimidation case against Black Panthers who appeared to be menacing voters at a polling place in 2008 in Philadelphia.16. Waging war all by myself:\u00a0Obama may have violated the Constitution and both the letter and the spirit of the War Powers Resolution by attacking Libya without Congressional approval.17. Biden bullies the press:\u00a0Vice President Biden\u2019s office has repeatedly interfered with coverage  including forcing a reporter to wait in a closet  making a reporter delete photos  and editing pool reports.18. AKPD not A-OK:\u00a0The administration paid millions to the former firm of then-White House adviser David Axelrod  AKPD Message and Media  to promote passage of Obamacare. Some questioned whether the firm was hired to help pay Axelrod $2 million AKPD owed him.19. Sestak  we\u2019ll take care of you:\u00a0Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used Bill Clinton as an intermediary to probe whether former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.) would accept a prominent  unpaid White House advisory position in exchange for dropping out of the 2010 primary against former Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).20. I\u2019ll pass my own laws:\u00a0Obama has repeatedly been accused of making end runs around Congress by deciding which laws to enforce  including the decision not to deport illegal immigrants who may have been allowed to stay in the United States had Congress passed the \u201cDream Act.\u201d*\" ", "Gary Carter": "\"\"\"China Joe\"\"    ...That's the name he got for receiving a billion dollars from China to look the other way...\" ", "Sunny Wakefield": "JOE IS GOING TO PARDON.

Did you know this  Yeah  you knew it. You had forgotten it  because it\u2019s never reported. No  hang on  before you go crazy out there  folks. Joe Biden\u2019s son  Hunter  was kicked out of the Navy for failing a cocaine drug test; then he divorced his wife  the mother of their three daughters  after a yearlong affair to marry his brother\u2019s widow.

Actually  worse than that. By the way  I have news links for every one of these stories.\u00a0This one is Delaware Online. Now  all of this is on top of the billions of dollars\u00a0Joe Biden dubiously arranged from the Ukraine. There is a huge financial scandal.

We\u2019re not supposed to talk about Hillary Clinton  but we can talk about the Bush daughters (Chelsea Clinton  I\u2019m sorry)  and we can smear the Trump kids all day long.

I\u2019m talking about the media. Just imagine if these things had happened to the Trump children. They have already smeared the Trump children. They have tried to link the Trump children to this mythical Russian collusion. They are now subpoenaing the financial records of the Trump Organization for the express purpose of trying to ruin the Trump family  including the children and Trump\u2019s businesses.

They were absolutely sure that it can be no other candidate other than Biden but assured me that when it came down to it  they would vote for whichever democratic candidate was elected. By and large the explanation that I kept hearing over and over from them is \u201cBiden is the most electable.\u201d So when I would ask why  the answer would be multiple shades of \u201cbecause he is the one that can win against Trump and that is the number one goal.\u201d  I was left confused as to what makes him the best candidate. I really really really don\u2019t get it.    But this explanation and a recent breakdown of polls by Vox begins to make sense of it for me but it still doesn\u2019t sit well. What I see is that Biden is a household name for the older more moderate generation. But this is exactly why I don\u2019t agree that he is the most electable. Trump was supposedly the least electable in his party but he reached the (albeit weirdly angry white) base he needed to reach to gain popularity. Biden is not only too safe but just too old school in his politics\u2014and his creepy ways are, well, yes, in the past, but still occurred no matter how many ways he finds to justify that it was a \u201cdifferent time.\u201d    It seems to me, that many in older generations don\u2019t even want to give other candidates a say. I believe it\u2019s because they hear the words communist and socialist being thrown around by the other party and they\u2019re afraid other candidates won\u2019t be able to reach across the aisles.  These words were vulgar to their generation. If people would only listen to what the real agendas of each candidate are, hopefully they\u2019d understand that those words are attached to these candidates to damage them but in reality do not describe their agendas.  We all need to listen to the candidates and their true agendas. I tend to like the candidates with the most clear agendas and the ones that have been fighting the fight not just talking about it. Sanders and Warren are high on my list because they bring high levels of knowledge of their constituents and experience, but I look forward to listening to each candidate\u2019s ideas. I think Biden has too much baggage and I tend to think he will say what he needs to say for votes.

The demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post.      Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 even without a quid pro quo \u2014 was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.) It got almost no attention, but in May [2018], CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as \u201cstrong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,\u201d the Democratic senators declared, \u201cWe have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,\u201d before demanding Lutsenko \u201creverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.\u201d The Democrats\u2019  Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: \u201cThis reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal \u2014 to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community \u2014 about your government\u2019s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.\u201d\" ", "robert williams": "Trying to impeach the president for starting an investigation probe.

Joe Biden led the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine shen he served as vice president. Biden helped shape Ukraine\u2019s energy and anti-corruption policies, issues that directly impact Burisma.     Burisma sought to capitalize Hunter Biden\u2019s name and relationships. According to The New York Times, Hunter Biden helped assemble the company\u2019s legal team, which consisted of American attorneys and consulting firms, including a former Obama Justice Department official.    Burisma is led by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky served as ecology minister under pro-Russia former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich, leading to allegations that he used his office to benefit Burisma.     Burisma was under legal scrutiny. Shortly before Hunter Biden was appointed to Burisma\u2019s board, British authorities froze $23 million of Zlochevsky\u2019s assets as part of a corruption investigation. Ukraine opened its own probe later that year.    Financial records from Morgan Stanley show numerous lines of money going into the account of \u201cRobert H.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.    There is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make, with all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric. They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I have never seen a politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23 contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political rhetoric among leading Democrats.

Aside from Gun's  Corn  and Crappy Fracked Oil. Please research what FDR and democratic socialism did for America. He was the only president that was elected for 4 terms because the public loved him so much. The great paying middle class jobs he created IS what made America the world leader it once was.

It\u2019s the largest immigrant detention system in the world. In addition to the fifteen ICE facilities, the Feds contract with hundreds of county jails, juvenile detention centers, and state prisons to house their detainees, at a cost of about 150 bucks a day per person, 350 for a family. Two-thirds of all facilities are run by private companies. The more bodies they have, the more money they make. Homeland Security, which ICE answers to, has a quota, one mandated by Congress.

DEMOCRAT politicians push hard to pass THE GUN FREE SCHOOL ZONES ACT. and the results are:  1) The result of this DEMOCRAT pushed unconstitutional law is that All children and teachers within their own schools are stripped of their 2nd Amendment Right to protect themselves, or be protected from rape, murder, psychos, and tyranny....which is why our founding fathers drafted the 2nd Amendment..... but primarily to stop a tyrannical Government from disarming children's schools which is what Hitler did, and it is exactly what the treasonous Democrats are doing today...... And we all know that psychos seek out disarmed venues in all cities.      2)  The psychotic component in all cities has now been given the Green Light by the DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS  who have disarmed every venue in all cities across the USA, and the psychos now see  these DEMOCRAT disarmed venues as target rich easy access killing fields. And 50+ children and teachers (after their own schools were forceably disarmed by DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS) are shot to death by a DEMOCRAT empowered psycho-murderer.      3) Hitler also disarmed children's schools and this also empowered the psycho-component in Germany to attack the disarmed children's schools.  Then afterward, Hitler said \"\"Children have been killed, turn in your guns...... \"\"   and the German people did  so.....   And you know the result.   DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS are doing the same in order to enslave the common people  for profit.      4) Democrats in California are already confiscating and burning our 2nd Amendment by voting for hundreds of bad gun laws...... Example.... gun list which restricts 99% of all guns available in other states.  California Democrats can get away with this because they force their Mexican Boarders open, and the Mexican Migrants are voting for the DEMOCRATS who let them in and and allow Mexicans to vote with no due process for citizenship.     5)  All of these shootings occurred because Democrats push to disarm all cities...... But at the same time, DEMOCRATS voted to ARM THEIR OWN GOV BUILDINGS WITH AR 15 RIFLES !!!      6)  The DEMOCRAT law above as well as all the other treasonous DEMOCRAT pushed laws like the Red Flag Law have each resulted in innocent US Citizens being killed.      It is time to take real action.    Arm all city venues by allowing well trained citizens to conceal carry a gun - which will provide the missing deterrent to all these attacks.      The primary reason that we cannot allow our Gov to restrict our capable battle rifles is because these rifles maintain a deterrent to Government Tyranny, and other crimes.      And the reason that we should NOT allow background checks is because our founding father were attacked by their own Government and if the Gov had a list of all gun owners, the British would have taken the guns first by using the background check list.......   Then attacked unarmed citizens.      VOTE !!!!    And Remove all Democrat Politicians in 2020.        A Quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero - Addressing the Roman Senate in the year (43 B.C.)        \"\"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within.     An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly.     But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys,     heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor;     he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments,     he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation,     he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city,     he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.\"\"\" ", "Aaron": "I want Yang. Binen is too old. No more presidents in their 70s. ", "Chris Nenshati": "Biden can't debate.

And he is not giving up now. 50 years later, he is still here for us. We can still count on him.  Before the climate, before gun laws, immigration, paths to citizenship, voting interference.... Before any of the multitudes of issues we face, Trump must be removed from office. As long as he is there, none of our problems will get better. Climate change will not be addressed, let alone be acknowledged, children will still  be taken from their parents. Agencies will continue to be dismantled. The rape of our country and fellow citizens will go on until he is removed from office!   Joe Biden is most qualified to save our country. He is the only one who's dedication is absolutely certain and success is absolutely proven.

But what he IS is PROVEN! We know his competence. We know his character. We know his courage. And we know his sincerity when he is given the task to lead in uncertain times, and his very best effort is applied. He's a true patriot. He genuinely loves this country. That was proven when in 2016 he chose not to run, despite pressures put upon him at the time, and his probable win if he had, because he knew he wasn't up for the job in the wake of his son Beau's death. He put the country first, and gave up his chance at an almost guaranteed ticket to the presidency because he loves this country more than he loved his own ambitions for political immortality.     Well, now he's back. Now he is up to the fight to save the soul of this country. I knows how to get the job done, and his experience and temperament may just be the ONLY thing to save us all from the cesspool of hate we are fast becoming under Trump.     I love Bernie. I always have, even before most of America ever noticed him. But the task of repairing and rebuilding America in the wake of Trump's sytematic destruction of every institution, safeguard, and ideal it took this country more than 200 years to achieve, requires a Joe Biden...not a Bernie Sanders. We need someone to work across the aisle, not vilify those who do. We need a uniter, not a divider. And Joe Biden has a long track record of success in these areas. Bernie does not.

Acts like these are going to give Trump a second term. This looks like a senile old man. Is this the best candidate the Democrats can come up with? So embarrassing.     Fact is: Joe Biden withheld support package to Ukraine unless they fired the investigator that investigated corruption at Barisma (the company his son worked).  That is a clear quid pro quo with a personal gain. He even admits it on TV footage. His son also had no experience in oil and gas industry and went along with his dad in Air Force 2 to China, after which Barisma got huge deals from China. Coincidence? That looks a lot like corruption. Abusing his position to help his son get a high position, get his company orders and getting an anti-corruption investigator fired.  Joe Biden actually did what the Democrats accuse Trump of. And far worse.  Trump just asked whether Ukraine could look into what happened at the time. Nowhere in the conservation there is pressure or asked for something in return. Zalinski said there was no pressure. The military support package was temp on hold because the US did not know what to expect from the new government but Ukraine did not even know this at the time of the conversation. There is no evidence that these two are related. In fact the package was given while there was no investigation. Which proofs there is no link.  Also his response to \"\"What do you want from Ukraine\"\" was \"\"I want nothing of Ukraine, tell him to do the right thing to do what he was elected for\"\" (which is fight corruption).   There is nothing wrong with asking a question to look into (possible) corruption. If Biden has nothing to hide then what is wrong with an investigation in what happened at the time? If nothing happened he will be cleared.    Why are the Democrats not simply talking about policies? Have conversations about how to help American people. All they do is orange man bad. Focus on your own message instead of the pure hate for a political opponent and throwing dirt, fake news and conspiracy theories. Like Russian collusion conspiracy theory and made up Steel report which has proven to be false. Even moderate Democrats like Tulsi Gabberd are accused of being a Russian spy. Its the new way to smear someone, call that person a Russian spy.   While there are actual Russian ties on the Democrats side, like the Steele report.  Focus on policies and real problems.

Well  its bothersome that no one has made the following point yet. Let's see  he is a lawyer and was hired to perform corporate governance best practices and was on the board of directors. 1. Most people know that typically board of directors of many companies include lay persons who are not in the industry and know little or nothing at all about it. Health care boards  county and local goverment boards  school district boards etc all do that! 2. He was providing guidance for corporate compliance and best practices ( one of the primary Functions of corprate lawyers). Which makes since for this conpany since they had previous cases of wrong doing. Perhaps they thought it wise to hire Hunter Biden in order to improve and show the efforts they were taking to conduct honest business. 3. As a lawyer  you do not have to be apart of nor have experience in a particular industry to be a legal representative. You don't have to be an athlete to represent a sports team  don't have to be a former teacher to represent teachers in a union  don't have to be a former doctor to represent an MD or hospital  don't have to be a former pilot to represent the pilot union or airline  and don't have to be in the oil or gas industry to represent or provide legal and consulting services to an oil/gas company.

Well  its bothersome that no one has made the following point yet. Let's see  he is a lawyer and was hired to perform corporate governance best practices and was on the board of directors. 1. Most people know that typically board of directors of many companies include lay persons who are not in the industry and know little or nothing at all about it. Health care boards  county and local goverment boards  school district boards etc all do that! 2. He was providing guidance for corporate compliance and best practices ( one of the primary Functions of corprate lawyers). Which makes since for this conpany since they had previous cases of wrong doing. Perhaps they thought it wise to hire Hunter Biden in order to improve and show the efforts they were taking to conduct honest business. 3. As a lawyer  you do not have to be apart of nor have experience in a particular industry to be a legal representative. You don't have to be an athlete to represent a sports team  don't have to be a former teacher to represent teachers in a union  don't have to be a former doctor to represent an MD or hospital  don't have to be a former pilot to represent the pilot union or airline  and don't have to be in the oil or gas industry to represent or provide legal and consulting services to an oil/gas company. You educate yourself on the services provided  laws that govern that industry  and ways to for the company to conduct themselves ethically. Kushner and Sondland had no prior foreign goverment experience. Ben Carson had no knowledge of Hud and housing other than having grown up in the projects.

He said that Trump had no ideology or beliefs, except that he should prevail in the end.    \"\"Trump\u2019s temperament and his habits have hardened with age.\"\" Schwartz said. \"\"He was always cartoonish, but compared with the man for whom I wrote The Art of the Deal 30 years ago, he is significantly angrier today: more reactive, deceitful, distracted, vindictive, impulsive and, above all, self-absorbed.\"\"  \"\"Every American ought to be concerned about his character.\"\" Schwartz said.  --Tony Schwartz, the ghost writer for Trump's book \"\"The Art of the Deal\"\":    What's so amazing to me is that he behaves like this at the age of 73. He's so detached from reality that he believes whatever he's saying is true, or at least ought to be true. I don't know if he's detached from reality, or if he simply rejects reality all together.
