Beside racist conversations there were conversations about putting pressure on Pete's donors to pressure Pete to fire the city's first black police chief, which he did as soon as he was elected.That is why Pete does not want those tapes made public.The racist officers in those conversations got the FBI to investigate to protect themselves. The chief was never charged and was given a settlement.        He issued a fake endorsement by over 400 South Carolina black voters ( some of whom turned out to be white )who did not read their emails and unknowingly endorsed his criminal justice plan by not opting out..This is sneaky Pete at his lowest.

Russia funded Facebook and Twitter Investments through Kushner Investor [TheGuardian]  Mark Zuckerberg has already shown his cards as to who he is aligned with.

Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg\u2019s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.    Help me out here... does this look suspicious? What does it mean when someone like Zuckerberg is aligning himself with just about anyone... he isn't the aligning himself with someone kind of person... I would say he sees Mayor Pete as a tool to go against Warren... and what does it mean when someone, anyone, accepts that relationship with Zuckerberg?

I guess you won't be hearing this or any other negative stories about Mayor Pete or his donors on MSNBC or any other Comcast related network.    Mayor Pete already has a history of selling out to his donors who forced him to fire the black police chief.

Beside racist conversations there were conversations about putting pressure on Pete's donors to pressure Pete to fire the city's first black police chief, which he did as soon as he was elected.That is why Pete does not want those tapes made public.The racist officers in those conversations may have got the FBI to investigate to protect themselves. The chief was never charged and was given a settlement..

His was a 6 month tour and he was in  all practicality  no danger whatsoever.   \u3000  Calling President Trump a racist when you have ZERO support from black voters in the race for the Democratic nomination is not only self serving, double standards and unethical but also doesn't make any sense.  \u3000  A common sentiment was clearly apparent in talks with several important African-American Lawmakers: that Buttigieg\u2019s interactions with the black community\u00a0 recently was \"\"na\u00efve\"\" and over-optimistic and that the national perception of him as \"\"genuine and authentic\"\" was NOT always translating when it came to the African-American community's concerns. \"\"Pete has a black problem,\"\" Rep.

We can respect the Second Amendment (on gun rights), and not allow it to be a death sentence for thousands of Americans.\"\" Why don't you worry about Gay suicide and stop putting the blame on the wrong gun owners. Mental health is a big problem in America, NOT gun ownership.      If he talks about anything other than mental health (suicides among gays) or stopping gang violence, he doesn\u2019t really care about  \"\"gun violence\"\" or is too ignorant to make the right judgment.

Marriage is still just between a Man and a Woman. Most people don't give a da__, what the man-made liberal minded crooked courts determined!  \u3000  Pete the cupcake has chosen to run on his sexual preference and if elected he would see his election as a mandated to serve based on his sexual preference, which would mean he represents only a small part of American society. Embracing perversion is not heroic it\u2019s hedonistic.  \u3000  Three-quarters (75%) of white voters who describe themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians voted for Republican House candidates in 2018. That is on par with the share who did so in midterm elections in 2014 (78%) and 2010 (77%).  \u3000  Evangelicals have been recognized as pivotal players in the American political landscape. As a vital component of the values voter bloc, along with conservative Roman Catholics, they are even credited with making the crucial difference in the 2004 presidential race.The adult population that is evangelical is a whopping 47 percent in 1998; last year's estimate was 48 percent.Fully 96% of evangelicals say religion is very important in their lives, and 93% say they pray every day.

Cupcake, Neuman, Feathers, Fruit-Fly, Donald Duck, Tinkerbelle ) and his first mate, or lady or whatever. That will NOT help us to gain back respect from the world. As soon as he/she is president he/she will appoint many Transvestites as his close advisors and put more gays and lesbians in the military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon will run for cover and the special forces will quit or retire early.   \u3000  Gay Pete will not be able to negotiate anything in Foreign Policy with the Russians, Korea, The Middle East ( Muslims ), Turkey, China and Africa and even many South American and Central America countries where they don't respect homosexuals.

I have lived in two countries with a national health insurance requirement.  If you want to cover the last 30% of your health care costs that you would otherwise have to pay out of pocket  you are free to buy private health insurance. The difference is that I can go to any doctor I choose in any hospital  get my EKG and a visit with the doctor to analyze it for $7.50 out of pocket  based on my national health insurance coverage. The costs are determined in regular negotiations between the government and health care providers. No  the doctor does not have a pretty office with paintings on the wall and soothing music. You want soothing music?  Go to a hotel lobby coffee shop. He has a hospital examination room and you wait in a noisy corridor that resembles an airport waiting room  unless you are an emergency case  in which case you are helped immediately in a separate part of the hospital.  However  I have a regular appointment  and I don't wait for two or three hours  unless my cardiologist is called into emergency surgery  which has happened once in four years.   I paid $1 500 (30% of the total cost of  I guess  $5 000) for a three and a half hour operation that had seven health professionals in the operating room before the anesthetic kicked in  and six days in the hospital recovering.  Because I asked for a single room  I had to pay a surcharge for that out of my own pocket  but because I had private insurance precisely for that purpose (at $300 per year in premiums  even at my post-retirement age)  I was pretty much reimbursed for that too.  Oh  while I was working full-time  I paid about 4% of my gross in annual premiums  which I was able to use as a deduction from income on my tax forms each year in this country.  For decades I paid in and hardly used the health system here at all.  When I needed it  though  after paying for 25 years  it was there to make me well and not bankrupt me in the process. Tell me this is worse than anything you get from private companies in the USA for 4% of your gross. The worst thing I can imagine is recovering from a serious illness and then wishing you were dead because you were poverty-stricken as a result. The mayor presents his health care goals and then takes a realistic approach to reaching them  unlike Pres. Trump  who has no realistic plan for reaching any of his goals  and that includes his dumb wall  much less infrastructure improvements  the denuclearization of North Korea and others.  The only things he has been able to accomplish took about 15 minutes of his time and effort in each case: two Supreme Court judges and a big tax cut  mostly for the rich  including himself and his family and associates.  Other people put lots of work into promoting Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and writing the tax bill  but those didn't require planning for the future of the nation. In fact  the tax cut might as well have included the message from the wealthiest Americans  \"\"The hell with the future.  We wanna get even richer and more powerful now!\"\"  As we all know  the president is unable and unwilling to focus on hashing out details on anything. \"\"Just gimme the thing to sign or the person to swear in\"\" is his modus operandi.  Mayor Buttigieg seems to have lots more smarts and energy  and a willingness to focus them long-term on achieving the goals of the American people.  He seems to be more realistic than some other Democrats  including some running for president  who think that if they just get elected  it will shock all the political institutions of the nation so much  that they will roll over and play dead for the new leader.  If that were true  Trump's wall would be half completed  at least  by now.  His victory certainly shocked the system  but there's still no new wall.  A realistic approach to reaching goals works better.  Both sides: stop waiting for saviors to steamroll your opponents and give you everything you want.

His \"\"M4A all that who want it\"\" will be a program full of old and sick people  these are the patient groups that require the most resources  the program will inevitably fail under its own weight and everyone will point to M4A and say 'hey look it doesn't work'. But that is incorrect  it failed because you only went half the way  giving the private insurance market an option to make premiums and rates competitive enough to pull all the young healthy people away from M4A will eventually lead to its demise. Single payer where everyone chips in a bit but also everyone benefits from the system as needed is a much better option than 'Medicate for those who want it' being burdened/underfunded because it only takes care of the disproportionately costly patient groups in society.       This candidate is Hillary Clinton 2.0, I do not trust him. If you disagree, I suggest you look into the firing of a black police chief during his time as mayor as an example. Pete goes where the money is, he is a savvy politician and has broad appeal to the liberal base, that is what makes him a dangerous candidate. The fact that he plays identity politics to paint some kind of rosy LGVTQI liberal/progressive appeal to counter the true progressives shows me what sort of politician he is.

Pete\u2019s run is over ", "David Stein": "\"What people fail to mention is that Darryl Boykins illegally wiretapped different officers telephone numbers before Buttigieg was Mayor and the officers reported it to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The U.S. Attorney's Office then contacted Buttigieg and told him unless Boykins resigned he would be prosecuted  which meant not only would he lose his position as chief of police but face criminal prosecution for it. So really  Buttigieg had no choice but tell Darryl Boykins what his options were  Boykins resigned. I have no doubt that several officers made racist remarks about Boykins but you ( can't) wiretap anyone without a court order and Boykins knew that. So he wasn't unjustly fired he was given two options by the U.S. Attorney's Office because of his own actions. Why because it's a violation of the fourth Amendment and the federal wiretap act.\" ", "Katkrasherpb": "\"Is this guy complaining that the police are too white?  1:15\" ", "dm 34280": "\"Buttigieg has been under fire over handling of a case in 2012 where he fired his former black police chief  Darryl Boykins  who was alleged to have improperly taped phone calls of senior white officers using racist language  particularly when addressing their boss. He swiftly replaced Boykins with a white man. Boykins' actions may have been unorthodox  but his tapes show a pattern and practice by white officers  not just in South Bend  but similar to what is now being investigated in Philadelphia. Just last week  72 of their officers were put on administrative leave while an internal investigation is underway regarding racist and offensive emails and social media posts. Rather than supporting his chief efforts at least  Buttigieg decided to fire him with no action taken against the racist officers. Last week most recent incident in South Bend which involved the tragic shooting of a black man by a white police sergeant (Ryan O'Neil) whose body camera was conveniently turned off. Court records show that the officer  Sgt. Ryan O\u2019Neill  has previously been accused of using racially charged language and excessive force against black suspects. After that he was promoted to sergeant. I understand Buttigieg does not promote police officers  but he can terminate them like he did the black police chief. Buttigieg has also faced criticism for his handling of other police-involved shootings. Buttigieg said that he was sometimes hesitant to speak publicly after police-involved shootings earlier in his time as mayor  and that he heard from the black community that he needed to be more open and transparent. Did the black community really have to make that clear  shouldn't he have known that without anyone telling him. He said he planned to meet with faith and community leaders. Now he wants to be transparent since he is running to be the democratic nominee in the presidential primary and needs black support in the primaries in order to get nomination. This guy will never receive the black (ADOS) vote.\" ", "Nick Hlawka": "All police departments (and most do) have to try to make their police departments percentage of black and white officers  be the same percentage of black and white citizens. Maybe Mayor Pete Buttigieg should start a NATION WIDE recruiting program to bring black officers to his city.

Healthcare is not an unnecessary middleman that steals from the money pool instead of paying for the care from that pool at a rate of least 20%.  We need a single payer that is not trying to make profit off the literal death and sickness of our citizens.    Economic mobility is in the toilet.    Education rankings are piss poor compared to the industrialized world.    Unions once representing at least 50% of the labor force now dwindle near 6-7%. And the fact that wages haven\u2019t kept with inflation for 40+ years only illustrates how much of a failure this is.    About those wages, and that millennials couldn\u2019t afford the American dream even if they did poll to want to own their own home. The math just doesn\u2019t work anymore.    And student loan debt? An albatross around the neck of anyone only trying to better themselves and contribute more in our society. A sick reality that people of all generations with tuition and interest debt face.    War making on par with this and the last few presidents.  Unconstitutional, unnecessary, and bleeding our treasury.  Let alone bleeding the world we attack and subjugate.

We had to built our country with no money and we abolished slavery from day one so we were poor A.F. and our manpower needed to be paid contrary to the USA that built their economy with no payroll cost for almost 100 years after their independence;  so back now to black people and how I compare the struggle with Mexico after our independence (mexican were also slaves to Spain) so when blacks were \"\"freed\"\" after the Civil War they had no education  no jobs and no retroactive payment so if they want somewhere to live they had to buy land or a house  but they weren't given the opportunity to get a job  or education different to white folks that when came from Europe many of the land was given to them after taken it from the natives or some just took them and defend it   yes they were poor whites before  during after the civil war  but they weren't being denied education or jobs based on their color of their skin  nor were incarcerated and forced to do slave jobs in prisons so this is something the Americans need to acknowledge and really understand the impact it has to this date.

She explained that another version of a Hyperwave actually called for a \u201cbuy in the $3,200 neighborhood,\u201d then a sell of just shy of where BTC reached in late-2017. Wald adds that due to the fact that Bitcoin has yet to post new all-time highs, the Hyperwave has yet to be invalidated, meaning that a move to $1,000 is still possible.    View image on Twitter  View image on Twitter    Leah Wald  @LeahWald  Replying to @LeahWald  15/ Is it still possible for BTC to hit the phase 1 line? Even though indicators are now bullish, there is historical precedence.     Yes, one example is sugar:    2:55 PM - May 21, 2019  37  See Leah Wald's other Tweets  Twitter Ads info and privacy  The analyst looks to the historical chart of sugar to accentuate her point. As seen above, from 1972 to 1985, the value of sugar followed an eerie trend. In 1974, it began to go parabolic, in a manner that may make cryptocurrency investors reminisce to late-2017 or any one of Bitcoin\u2019s earlier bull cycles.    By early-1975, the parabola had been breached, and sugar fell almost all the way back down, to within 6% of its base. Then, in a weird twist of fate, the value of sugar nearly retested its prior all-time high in a secondary parabola but fell slightly short of setting a new high. And after an 11-year cycle, sugar finally revisited its base in 1984, completing the extended Hyperwave. Wald explains:    \u201cSugar\u2019s price got within a whisker of returning to Phase 1, and then rallied back to near ATH territory, before selling off all the way back down to Phase 1. Just because the trend is turning bullish, the HW Phase 1 target is not invalidated until a new ATH is created.\u201d\" ", "BB": "\"Bottom line  he  along with the rest of the Democrats  condon the murder of millions of mostly black  unborn children.

Because guns are an incentive for an individual to take the law into their own hands  thus sidelining the legislative and especially the judiciary branch.

' Cupcake' ) will NEVER become president. GUARANTEED  \u3000  This man/woman or whatever is all show and hasn't got a clue as to what he would do if he became the POTUS. He uses his \"\"vast experience\"\" in the military as his crowning achievement, pointing to his tour in Afghanistan, when he spent his tour as the equivalence as a jeep driver and a low level clerk for an officer in an area where there was no enemy activity, NO COMBAT EXPERIENCE, NEVER RISKED HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY. His was a 6 month tour and he was in, all practicality, no danger whatsoever.   \u3000  As first reported by Fox News, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s brother-in-law is accusing his 2020 campaign of misrepresenting his family\u2019s past for political gain.  \u3000  He\u2019s even claiming \"\"misrepresentation\"\" has led to death threats.  \u3000  Buttigieg husband\u2019s brother recently spoke to The Washington Examiner and revealed some lies coming from the Mayor\u2019s campaign and their back story.  \u3000  \"\"A mayor from a small city and his husband, a child who grew up with nothing and his parents kicked him out \u2026 it makes a perfect political story for the campaign\u2026To me that\u2019s very sad. If that\u2019s all you have to stand on, you\u2019re not fit to be president of the United States,\"\" stated Glezman.  \u3000  Pete Buttigieg ( a.k.a. 'Cupcake' ), mayor of South Bend, Indiana, with a population of 101,000 is conveniently mute about his lack of accomplishment there. (For example, the crime rate there is 120% higher than the national average, the homeless rate is even worst.) He is simply running on his widely unpopular sexual preference, which most people find it disgusting and have little interest in, or would choose not to know anything about due to its unhealthy and filthy nature. He will be one of the first to fall off the list of potential candidates running in the democratic primary, GUARANTEED  \u3000  Now that he's come out, he/she can go home. People who don't understand their gender shouldn't be governing the rest of us. They can live with each other just not around me. Enjoy your life. Come to think of it, he does look like Neuman the ugly cartoon character. He was Sixteen years old and well into puberty and he didn't know he was gay !. No doubt in anyone's mind and support for the conclusion to those who say you aren't born that way, you chose to be that way. The identity politics of shaming people for disliking aberrant behavior. So predictable.  \u3000  The LGBTQ people ( only 4% of the population ) tends to portray its group as victims. They choose that type of filthy lifestyle. When people don\u2019t agree with their lifestyle (lgbtq), they are labeled as bigots. Pete said \"\"creating a crisis of belonging for people of color, immigrants, gay people and others.   \u3000  Cupcake Dude !, You got it exactly backwards. The identity mindset and politics of the liberal socialists left or social justice warriors, obsessed with promoting people of color, immigrants, Muslims, Felons, Illegal Aliens, homeless, deadbeats, ex-criminals and gay people beyond any rational and patriotic boundary to the point of detriment to everybody else and even those groups themselves (see pathological altruism), created the crises of belonging for the rest of us. It\u2019s one of the key and main reasons why Donald Trump was elected. Hillary on the other hand had everything for people of color, immigrants and gays. She had nothing but contempt for flyover working class America.  \u3000  Basically all this guy has to run on is that he\u2019s gay and somehow ( in true democrat form) he has twisted some text in the Bible to justify his practice of man on man filthy unsafe love. Marriage is still just between a Man and a Woman. Most people don't give a da__, what the man-made liberal minded crooked courts determined!  \u3000  Pete the cupcake has chosen to run on his sexual preference and if elected he would see his election as a mandated to serve based on his sexual preference, which would mean he represents only a small part of American society. Embracing perversion is not heroic it\u2019s hedonistic.  \u3000  Gay President Buttigieg ( a.k.a. Cupcake, Neuman, Feathers, Fruit-Fly, Donald Duck, Tinkerbelle ) and his first mate, or lady or whatever. That will NOT help us to gain back respect from the world. As soon as he/she is president he/she will appoint many Transvestites as his close advisors and put more gays and lesbians in the military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon will run for cover and the special forces will quit or retire early. Gay Pete will not be able to negotiate anything in foreign policy with the Russians, Korea, The Middle East ( Muslims ), Africa and even many South American and Central America countries where they don't respect homosexuals. There are way too many countries and religions that do NOT tolerate Homosexuals so what was this Mayor Pete thinking when he decided to run ? he must have been in a fantasy wishful thinking mode ! WAKE UP ! Pete, the world\u00a0 outside the USA is very different and INTOLERANT  \u3000  When is the world going to stop justifying all this sex changing mentally unstable celebrities and their filthy lifestyles and look at the real psychological reasons why these people chose to do this. The fact is most people that have sex identity problems need serious long term psychotherapy.   \u3000  In the USA 1.7 percent of the adult population identifies as gay or lesbian. Another 1.8 percent of the US adult population identifies as bisexual. That leaves 97 percent of the USA's adult population identifies as straight, without an identity problem and able to reproduce like normal people.      The gay community demands to be treated as equal but doesn't support any other orientation and wants special privileges and respect from 97% of the population. We set aside an entire month to celebrate a union of two people who can not create a next generation and represent less than 5% of the US population. But a parade for \"\"straight\"\" people is a problem for them? Their DOUBLE STANDARDS is without merit. Respect is something you earn, but they haven't earn it yet from the 97%, or the rest of us  \u3000  How can The City of Boston can deny the application, based on what justification?. If they do - We would expect the ACLU and other civil rights groups to have a hissy fit. This is NOT hate for \"\"Pride\"\" it is about equal rights and celebrating your sexual orientation - we all have a right to peaceful assembly - right? That's what protects ALL of us.    \u3000  Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Depression is a very serious disorders that should be taken far more seriously within the transgender community. By their own report, 80% of transgender attempt suicide some time in their life. To me, that sounds deadly serious and is enough proof beyond any doubt that these people need psychiatric treatment at an early age .  \u3000    When the world stops idolizing and promoting this type of\u00a0 EXTREME MENTAL DISORDER , and Narcissistic Personality Disorder, then and only then will they will seek a good psychiatrist . There should be a military draft for all this people and they should put them in the front line in a real intense bloody battle against the enemy and show a video of their behavior, then and only then is the world is going to realized how useless they are for the rest of us normal citizens and for society in general. Is bad enough that two people of the same sex cannot reproduce children and therefore should never be given a marriage license but due to political corruption and decadence of our society and due to the ignorance of the electorate voters, this new trend has grown to the detriment of moral values, common sense and rational thinking.  \u3000  One day in the future it will be exposed and confirm that this trans-sexual movement and same sex marriage was a horrible moment in world history and human reproductive progress due to the newly discovered reality by medical science and rational politicians that they have a serious mental disorder. Future society and future generations will agreed that these people are a very bad ideal human model and should not be tolerated or justify and in fact it is detrimental to an ideal healthy reproductive society. The treatment will change to therapy and possibly a new drug. That time will come because the rational majority, the ones not under media hype and pc control see thru the bullsheet and the false justification and irrational thinking.  \u3000  Homosexual relationships are not marriage and will never be consider by normal people as a healthy human model relationship. That is, they simply do not fit the minimum necessary condition for a marriage to exist--namely, the union of a reproductive man and a woman that can form a family by their biological fertility.  \u3000  The second is that homosexual relationships are proven harmful. Not only do they NOT provide the same benefits to a healthy society as heterosexual marriages, but their consequences are far more negative than positive.Either argument, standing alone, is sufficient to reject the claim that same-sex unions should be granted the legal status of marriage.     Anticipating some negative feedback from this proven true , qualified, confirmed and rational opinion from all the ' cup cake butterflies ' out there , it is very self serving for them to justify their behavior , of course their opinion doesn't have any weight or merit since most of them are not part of normal society and will be disregarded as biased, under mental disorder and handicapped feedback.\" ", "2019-07-03T10:50:16.000Z": "rigor m 8:10 you mean how the last dem nominee called her opposition \u201cdeplorables\u201d and expected to win?

If you count Donald Trump, then we've had 45 presidents. Buttigieg can't possibly think that a sample size of 45 is enough to enough to \"\"almost\"\" apply scientific certainty to having at least one gay member when we have a historical population of around 950 million people who were born in the US since its founding.     That's my own personal calculations for that number btw, assuming 2% population increase per year between each official US census, I counted slaves during years when they couldn't have been president even theoretically, just because I never liked them being called 1 8th of a person, and also because record keeping in the early years of the us was so bad that my number is probably really conservative even with the inflation. Even assuming purely official numbers though, and discounting people who never had a legal ability to be elected like those who were born from illegal immigrants or non white races during Jim Crow and slavery years, the minimum total population of people who could ever have been president theoretically in the history of the us is at least 221 million.    Now, studies have been all over the place regarding the percentage of homosexual people of either gender in any population, limited at very least by how does one define gay, as well as, will they even consider themselves gay despite whatever their sexual preference is, and be willing to admit it to someone doing a study. As well as the fact that this wasn't even really put under sober  scientific scrutiny as a topic untill the 50s. However there have been a few respected studies I can find, as defined by having a specific definition of homosexual spectrums (bisexuals and people who at least occasionally have sex with members of the same gender, despite personal definition) and scrupulously maintaining anonymity for those who participate to ensure privacy and accuracy.    Those studies typically put the number in men for those who primarily or exclusively desire men (whether or not they hide it by keeping a female relationship as cover) at about 5% at the lowest to about 13% a the highest. Including bisexuality raises that substantively, and he might consider that in the closet, so let's say 15% which is a rough average of studies that cover any man who has ever had consensual sex with another man.    A lot of people would say that number would apply to any sample size, i.e. 15% of our presidents were secretly gay, which seems to be what buttigieg is assuming, but that is incorrect. To find the real number, you have to apply the percentage to a total number of all people who meet the constitutional requirements at least, and more broadly those who could theoretically have won, had they run, at every point in history, and then apply the sample size to that.    But I don't want to do that much work, so I'm just going to punch to constitutional requirements population into my college statistics calculator.    I get about a 10% to 15% likelihood that ONE United States president has sex with another man at some point in his life depending on which statistical method I use.

There are two issues that he raised in his inspiring speech that I feel are sadly beyond his control. (But I certainly wish him every success in finding a way to solve the crisis.) My first issue... I have to question the realistic ability of America to curtail the current situation regarding the rapidly declining global environment and the resulting global climate changes or as this presidential hopeful calls it 'climate security.' My second issue... is the optimistic desire to continue to open the American borders to those desperate people fleeing for their lives while there is no money available anymore for the American government to finance the increasing numbers of immigrants arriving every year. If you consider that the global population was 1 billion in 1919 and it is now over 8 billion in 2019 (at that rate  there will be over 16 billion people on the planet in 50 years ) how exactly is America supposed to continue to support an increasing number of these immigrants... to pay for their food  clothing and shelter needs  their transportation needs  medical needs and education  year after year because there are no jobs available in America for these immigrants to support themselves. If you consider America is over 20 TRILLION dollars in debt in 2019 and paying over 500 billion dollars every year in debt interest every year. There is no money left to save everyone else  when tens of millions of jobless and homeless Americans are desperate and struggling to save themselves. He says dollars cannot drown out the will of the people  but unfortunately 'money talks.' Good intentions do not pay the bills and America is bankrupt  there needs to be someone honest enough to say no to immigrant demanding that they be allowed to live in America and have all of their bills paid for by the American people  year  after year  after year  because tens millions of jobs in America have been replaced forever by slave labour in China and India  by more and more efficient roboitic assembly lines and the latest cost saving technology consuming Americas jobs. The decline of the economy has reduced the number of Americans working and as a result the taxes paid to the government have drastically declined as well... there simply is no money anymore for the government to financilly support hundreds of thousand of immigrants for years and years  especially with so many millions of Americans doing without. With regard to the climate  I suppose America can try to be a positive role model and do it's part to stop polluting in America and try to repair the damage where possible across America  but the reality is  climate change is a global crisis and when countries all ver the globe are dumping billions of tons of toxic pollution into the water and the air.... it seems like a lost cause and beyond Americas control. (Consider the Japanese government has recently approved dumping another 700000 TONS of boiling hot nuclear wast into the ocean  from the nuclear reactors that were destroyed by the 2011 tsunami  and that is in addition to the 1000000 TONS of nuclear waste that have already been dumped into the ocean since the disaster of 2011. Of course America can point fingers and explain how such actions are warming the oceans and are a threat to the survival of the planet but there is quite simply no way to stop Japan or any other country from doing whatever it wants.) America can only clean up it's own back yard and prevent their environment from being exploited by global corporation bent on making money at any cost. Take for example the Swiss owned company Nestle that has been exploiting Americas fresh water natural resources  for decades. While the global temperatures increase to record highs and drought chokes America and burns it's cities to the ground because of a lack of water  Nestle keeps it's eye on the profits to be made and continues to mine the underground water table  only paying the American government 3 or 4 dollars for a million gallons of it's precious fresh drinking water (as a matter of fact  untouchable Nestle continues to mine billions of gallons of water every year across America even when their permits have expired... none of the towns being exploited have the money to dare to take on Nestles massive legal team.) Billions of gallons of Americas precious fresh drinking water are bottled and then sold to Americans with the billions in profits going to Switzerland. The rest of the world is left with hundreds of thousands of TONS of toxic plastic bottles polluting the environent. Maybe that is something America could change  and help save the planet  but it is just a drop in the bucket and sadly I think it is a lost cause. (Deep sigh... clearly I got carried away. What can I say  I just love this planet and it really is sad to see how tragic the situation is today. Hopefully this presidential hopeful can shine his light and inspire the rest of the world to be more aware and take advantage of the one last chance the planet has to recover. And perhaps he can find a way to stop the decades of rampant greed and corruption that has destroyed the American dream and set the American economy back on track. Who knows  once America is booming again  there could be money available for the government to welcome immigrants into the country and they will be able to work and support themselves. That would seem to be the plan  so I will try and stay positive and start by saying  God bless Pete Buttigieg and God bless America.)\" ", "Ramblequist": "Platitudes ", "Jebster Sr": "We already had our first fudge packer & tonsil hockey president in barack obummer...

They are really telling us exactly what\u2019s going so wrong they just are saying it\u2019s bad. Many people don\u2019t believe it\u2019s bad. I mean I don\u2019t know exact numbers that I\u2019m not going to claim to be an expert but I haven\u2019t seen any reports saying that we are in a lot more Dad or that unemployment is a lot worse or anything like that. I think that a lot of people have picked these issues that caused a lot of uproar and think that that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the country like guns  racial issues and immigration. The Problem is the people who are on one side of these issues are already decided who they\u2019re going to vote for if they are passionate about it. If you are hard-core against guns you aren\u2019t going to vote Republican. If you are somebody who thinks that Donald Trump has somehow caused the country to be more racially divided you aren\u2019t going to vote Republican. The issues they really need to be focusing on our things that everybody is concerned with like their money and such. I\u2019m not saying some of those other issues are important I\u2019m just saying nobody\u2019s minds are going to be changed so people like O\u2019Rourke whore going all in on the gun control debate are going to be in for a huge disappointment when they find out that they\u2019re not going to win any voters by saying that Donald Trump is the cause of some of these mass shootings. That\u2019s just ridiculous talk and honestly some people are going to be really turned off by that who may have listen to the guy otherwise. If these Democrats want to win they really have to start just attacking Trump and actually talk about the issues that they supposedly have a problem with. And before anybody attacks me and says that I\u2019m a Donald Trump supporter I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m just saying that I\u2019m tired of hearing these candidates only talk about what\u2019s wrong and they don\u2019t go into details. A lot of these guys are going all in on the heat for Trump and that\u2019s just not going to work because there are a lot of people that really love the guy and love the way that he runs things. Anytime I hear a celebrity or something act like everybody thinks Donald Trump is the devil I laugh because that\u2019s not true at all. There are a lot of people that maybe they don\u2019t hang out with who really do like him so instead of just going all in on that people really need to start looking at the issues and the Democrats aren\u2019t going to be able to win unless they are smarter about that\" ", "2019-09-30T18:15:14.000Z": "Hmm \"Another thing please go look at tyt they have on piece on buttigieg and the firing of the the first black police chief.

It's one thing to be a left-leaning media outlet or a right-leaning media outlet. We all have different values and those values manifest in bias. But there's an important difference between promoting your values and your moral code, which at least has the integrity of sticking up for your beliefs, and imposing your specific personal preferences onto others and literally stiffling the voice of anyone who disagrees with you or doesn't favor your personal interests, which is not a matter of integrity but a matter of arrogant self-importance. It's honestly insulting that MSNBC thinks they can get away with this - that they think THEY are more important in deciding who will be the next president than the candidates themselves - that THEIR opinion is more important than the opinions of the candidates and the American people.     Obviously, I'm not saying the right wing media is any better. But why does the media in general insist on pushing an agenda and manipulating public sentiment? How little do they respect the American people - how little, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, do you respect the American people that you can't trust them to make the decision that is best for them?

Beside racist conversations there were conversations about putting pressure on Pete's donors to pressure Pete to fire the city's first black police chief, which he did as soon as he was elected.That is why Pete does not want those tapes made public.The racist officers in those conversations may have got the FBI to investigate to protect themselves. The chief was never charged and was given a settlement..

On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.        Background:  What is a Use Case Model?   A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals.       Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:  Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect.   Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.      Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:  Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.      How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?  Planning Scenario:  In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their \u2018dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life.       Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us:   Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a \u2018trickle-up\u2019 community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.      Economic Prognosis:   Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation.

After nearly four years of Donald Trump the bulk of Americans are looking for competency . . .  they are looking for qualified people . . . worthy of trust . . . to address the issues that impact their daily lives.    The question for Democrats should not be which one of these fine candidates do we place in a position of *singular titular authority* . That is an old way of thinking and that it's what needs to change to move America forward at this critical time.    Read any highly regarded book on executive - - business or military - -  leadership and you will learn the smartest, most successful executives are not afraid to hire people . . . *smarter than they are* to work for them. They *are not insecure about their position* unlike President #44 is.    The winning strategy for a Democratic candidate in this field is to proactively and aggressively *run a Solution Team for America* .     Maybe that's a candidate like Cory Booker . . .  who's on the verge a falling off of the debate stage. Or maybe its a candidate like Joe Biden . . . who commands a significant following and respect within the party but who has shown signs of selective weakness in the debates.    Imagine if you could get 100% of each Democratic primary candidate's support to turn out vigorously in the general election in November.    Trump would surely lose and Democrats surely take the Senate . . . keep the House . . .  and be able to govern progressively. They would address the problems of the bulk of American and then win a resounding landslide in a re-election in 2024.    The candidate who *convincingly and  proactively commits*  . . .  in words, action and reputation-staking-pledges . . . to DECENTRALIZED POWER to their erudite, passionate Cabinet Secretaries . . . hereafter expressed and treated as *Assistant President of **_______* . . . would guarantee a Democrat wins in 2020 AND would  secure themselves a highly favorable place in the history books.     Barack Obama showed us the way in 2008 when he selected Hillary Clinton, not as VP but as Secretary of State.    What one position on the team would Elizabeth Warren's supporters want her to play?  Where could she have undeniable favorable progressive impact if empowered? I say as Treasury Secretary. Those at the lower end of the economic spectrum would see soundly thought out *Tax and Fiscal policies biased towards them* .

Even her critics would bet that this outsized impact would appeal to her ambitions.    Andrew Yang as an empowered Secretary of Commerce . . . how could he move the country forward . . . in the lane best suited for him?     Tulsi Gabbard as VA Secretary . . . who better than her to own solving the problems of the veterans administration?    For a minute, imagine Biden as the top of the ticket nominee and  VP Pete Buttigieg as one of the \"\"Next Generation\"\" Democrats to take the baton from him in 2024. Or put Bernie the top of the ticket and replace him at HHS, I don't care.   Swap in Booker or Castro for any of these roles, it wouldn't change the strategy.

The formula would be IQ+EQ+SQ with EQ and SQ being the more important.  IQ [Intelligence] without healthy EQ [emotional] and SQ [social] could give you a brilliant sociopath/narcissist.      Mayor Pete doesn't display any emotions.  Warren and Sanders present great passion for their cause... Pete... he is near emotionless.  Is Pete taking meds for PTSD?    From the works of PhD Antonio Damasio which shows that people can have a high IQ and do well on IQ tests but without healthy emotions they could no longer make choices, prioritize tasks, manage their time or said differently, they do poorly on the EQ and SQ scales failing in relationships, jobs etc.    And that brings me to these two pieces of information.    Russia funded Facebook and Twitter Investments through Kushner Investor [TheGuardian]  Mark Zuckerberg has already shown his cards as to who he is aligned with.    Mark Zuckerberg Has Quietly Recommended Campaign Hires to Pete Buttigieg [Bloomberg]  Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech\u2019s most powerful executives.    Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg\u2019s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.    Help me out here... does this look suspicious? What does it mean when someone like Zuckerberg is aligning himself with just about anyone... he isn't the aligning himself with someone kind of person... I would say he sees Mayor Pete as a tool to go against Warren... and what does it mean when someone, anyone, accepts that relationship with Zuckerberg?  Is it a case of Mayor Pete, an intellect, aligning himself with another intellect or since Mayor Pete is presenting an opposing view of Warren and that is drawing Zuckerberg into Mayor Pete's realm but to go to bed with Zuckerberg which has already been shown connected to the Russians???\" ", "BABY ridg": "\"If Pete Budegeig were to debate against Donald.....

Johnson, The Root\u2019s politics editor and one of the most prominent pundits on racial politics and issues, made his remarks after two national polls (CNN, Quinnipiac) this week found that the South Bend, Indiana, Mayor has 0% support from black Democrats.    \u201cAt this point, Donald Trump is more popular with black voters than Mayor Pete,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat is a problem if you are a Democrat running for office.\u201d    At Jesse Jackson\u2019s Rainbow PUSH conference on Tuesday 2 JUuy 2019, Buttigieg whined that the media keep pestering about his abysmal poll numbers with black Democrats, who will likely make up  60% of the electorate in South Carolina\u2019s critical first-in-the-South primary that will make or break many candidacies.    \u201cI am asked how I\u2019m going to earn the black vote in the polls ten times more often than how my policies would benefit black Americans,\u201d Buttigieg reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m being asked more about how to win than how to deserve to win.\u201d    Then in what may have been another tone-deaf moment for an egghead candidate who has been criticized as being the epitome of a \u201cbriefing-book Democrat\u201d who is unable to empathize with various constituencies, Buttigieg said that black Democrats \u201cneed to understand the details\u201d of his Douglass Plan for black America.    After a white South Bend police officer, who did not have his body camera turned on,  killed a black resident, Buttigieg, who had already lost the trust of many black residents when he demoted the city\u2019s first black police chief because he secretly recored white officers allegedly making racist comments, was slammed for bungling the situation even though he left the campaign trail for a few days to address the police shooting. The Washington Post noted that \u201cinstead of showcasing But\u00adtigieg\u2019s ability to lead through a crisis,\u201d the South Bend shooting \u201cis exposing what has long been considered an Achilles\u2019 heel of his candidacy: his frosty relationship with South Bend\u2019s black residents.\u201d    Buttigieg reportedly \u201calienated the family of the dead man, Eric Logan\u201d when he spoke to the media before the family, \u201cskipped a vigil at the scene of the shooting, and sought advice from outsiders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York.\u201d Buttigieg has been panned for not being able to name black activists in South Bend who support him, and the Post noted that to many of Buttigieg\u2019s detractors, his actions after the shooting again showed that \u201che still doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d    Oliver Davis, \u201cthe longest-serving black member of the South Bend Common Council,\u201d told the Post: \u201cHow\u2019s he handling it?. Well, he talked to the media before the family. He skipped the family vigil, full of black residents. And then he then gave a speech to the police. So, how do you think that went over?\u201d    While addressing protesters, Buttigieg seemed out of his depth and had another awkward interaction with activists while speaking with a bullhorn even though activists were just a few feet away from him.    \u201cYou\u2019re running for president? And you want black people to vote for you? That\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d a female black resident shouted at Buttigieg, who responded, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for your vote.\u201d    \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna get it, either,\u201d the activist then replied.    When asked during last week\u2019s debate why South Bend\u2019s police department did not have more people of color, Buttigieg replied: \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d    Buttigieg hauled in $24 million last quarter, but the South Bend mayor cannot win his party\u2019s nomination if he continues to poll at 0% with black Democrats.\" ", "Rob Brown": "\"Buttigieg is finished as a candidate in 2020 as the DNC will never allow a candidate to win the nomination without the support of people of color.

I guess you won't be hearing this or any other negative stories about Mayor Pete or his donors on MSNBC or any other Comcast related network.      Mayor Pete already has a history of selling out to his donors who forced him to fire the black police chief.

Beside racist conversations there were conversations about putting pressure on Pete's donors to pressure Pete to fire the city's first black police chief, which he did as soon as he was elected.That is why Pete does not want those tapes made public.The racist officers in those conversations may have got the FBI to investigate to protect themselves.

Under the current framework, there are NO ASSURANCES when you get sick and you are either rejected by insurance companies or are unable to pay the premiums (don't even talk about getting sick and being unemployed). What \"\"choice\"\" do you have then? Set up a GoFundMe, live in misery, or die.      I would expect the next president to prioritize people over capitalism and to direct his/her energy into ensuring the health of the whole rather than just the privileged few.  A universal, single-payer system where everyone pitches in to help each other out when they need it would do that.  It is the humane approach.  The idea that a private health care plan may be better than a public one should make us question why that would be.  Why should the quality of care be different?  Why are other countries able to make their public/universal healthcare structure work (and have better health outcomes overall)?  There's a lot of scaremongering going on and it's stemming from Big Pharma and insurance companies which stand to lose to ton of money.  Key thing to remember: to avoid inequality, the universal system cannot be an \"\"option\"\".  Just like public education, a government must decide to provide it freely to all or to none (not some here and there in certain classes or pockets of wealth).  Otherwise, it undermines the principle to ensure that EVERYONE is insured and gets the SAME level of care.  Message to Buttigieg who claims to be Christian: YOU ARE YOUR BROTHER'S KEEPER.      By the way...why are some defending the ACA (\"\"Obamacare\"\") as if it's the ultimate best and cannot be improved?  Sure, it was the step in the right direction but it can (and should) go further.      Basic question: does America want ALL of its citizens to have health coverage regardless of age, class, gender, or medical/employment status?  Is the current situation of experiencing premature death or bankruptcies due to medical expenses something that Americans take pride in?  I wonder.

When asked to defend his campaign's use of carbon-spewing private jets at CNN's \"\"climate crisis town hall\"\" on Wednesday, Boat Shoes showed little remorse for the planet. \"\"This is a very big country and I'm running to be president of the whole country,\"\" he told Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor sometimes referred to as \"\"Fredo.\"\"        Pete Buttigieg defends use of private planes for campaigning #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/enEpvvcWcI pic.twitter.com/zs17zuZDw6        \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 5, 2019    Buttigieg sits at 4.6% in the RealClearPolitics national polling average. If you're not already convinced his campaign is going nowhere, consider the fact that he failed to record a statistically significant level of support among black voters in an August Quinnipiac poll. Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, who did not qualify for the third primary debate, managed to get 1%.    Speaking of black voters, Buttigieg represents a number of them in his capacity as mayor of South Bend, Ind. There have been calls for his resignation in response to his handling of the city's police department after a white sergeant fatally shot a black resident on Father's Day.    Some might argue that Buttigieg's time would be better spent meeting with voters in his own community rather than jetting around in a pointless effort to become \"\"president of the whole country\"\" at age 37. Instead, he appears on national television to suggest that people who could never afford private air travel but nevertheless insist on eating hamburgers and using plastic straws are \"\"part of the problem.\"\"    Meanwhile, another Democratic candidate with absolutely no shot at winning the party's nomination, failed Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, is desperately seeking attention by live-blogging his 4-hour bus ride from New York to Boston.        Beto O\u2019Rourke spox says that he is indeed taking the Bolt bus from NY to Boston bc it pollutes less.

Johnson, The Root\u2019s politics editor and one of the most prominent pundits on racial politics and issues, made his remarks after two national polls (CNN, Quinnipiac) this week found that the South Bend, Indiana, Mayor has 0% support from black Democrats.    \u201cAt this point, Donald Trump is more popular with black voters than Mayor Pete,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat is a problem if you are a Democrat running for office.\u201d    At Jesse Jackson\u2019s Rainbow PUSH conference on Tuesday 2 JUuy 2019, Buttigieg whined that the media keep pestering about his abysmal poll numbers with black Democrats, who will likely make up  60% of the electorate in South Carolina\u2019s critical first-in-the-South primary that will make or break many candidacies.    \u201cI am asked how I\u2019m going to earn the black vote in the polls ten times more often than how my policies would benefit black Americans,\u201d Buttigieg reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m being asked more about how to win than how to deserve to win.\u201d    Then in what may have been another tone-deaf moment for an egghead candidate who has been criticized as being the epitome of a \u201cbriefing-book Democrat\u201d who is unable to empathize with various constituencies, Buttigieg said that black Democrats \u201cneed to understand the details\u201d of his Douglass Plan for black America.    After a white South Bend police officer, who did not have his body camera turned on,  killed a black resident, Buttigieg, who had already lost the trust of many black residents when he demoted the city\u2019s first black police chief because he secretly recored white officers allegedly making racist comments, was slammed for bungling the situation even though he left the campaign trail for a few days to address the police shooting. The Washington Post noted that \u201cinstead of showcasing But\u00adtigieg\u2019s ability to lead through a crisis,\u201d the South Bend shooting \u201cis exposing what has long been considered an Achilles\u2019 heel of his candidacy: his frosty relationship with South Bend\u2019s black residents.\u201d    Buttigieg reportedly \u201calienated the family of the dead man, Eric Logan\u201d when he spoke to the media before the family, \u201cskipped a vigil at the scene of the shooting, and sought advice from outsiders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York.\u201d Buttigieg has been panned for not being able to name black activists in South Bend who support him, and the Post noted that to many of Buttigieg\u2019s detractors, his actions after the shooting again showed that \u201che still doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d    Oliver Davis, \u201cthe longest-serving black member of the South Bend Common Council,\u201d told the Post: \u201cHow\u2019s he handling it?. Well, he talked to the media before the family. He skipped the family vigil, full of black residents. And then he then gave a speech to the police. So, how do you think that went over?\u201d    While addressing protesters, Buttigieg seemed out of his depth and had another awkward interaction with activists while speaking with a bullhorn even though activists were just a few feet away from him.    \u201cYou\u2019re running for president? And you want black people to vote for you? That\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d a female black resident shouted at Buttigieg, who responded, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for your vote.\u201d    \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna get it, either,\u201d the activist then replied.    When asked during last week\u2019s debate why South Bend\u2019s police department did not have more people of color, Buttigieg replied: \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d    Buttigieg hauled in $24 million last quarter, but the South Bend mayor cannot win his party\u2019s nomination if he continues to poll at 0% with black Democrats.\" ", "LogicalAtheist": "\"Thank you  Pete  for mentioning the grief of the family.\u00a0 With you as a role model  I believe we can \u201ccome together\u2026and repair  and come out stronger in the broken places.\u201d\u00a0 This country needs a \u201cuniter \u201d not a \u201cdivider.\u201d\u00a0 And we need unity ASAP.   \u00a0#BeLikePete Treat others with respect and sincerity.

When asked to defend his campaign's use of carbon-spewing private jets at CNN's \"\"climate crisis town hall\"\" on Wednesday, Boat Shoes showed little remorse for the planet. \"\"This is a very big country and I'm running to be president of the whole country,\"\" he told Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor sometimes referred to as \"\"Fredo.\"\"        Pete Buttigieg defends use of private planes for campaigning #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/enEpvvcWcI pic.twitter.com/zs17zuZDw6        \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 5, 2019    Buttigieg sits at 4.6% in the RealClearPolitics national polling average. If you're not already convinced his campaign is going nowhere, consider the fact that he failed to record a statistically significant level of support among black voters in an August Quinnipiac poll. Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, who did not qualify for the third primary debate, managed to get 1%.    Speaking of black voters, Buttigieg represents a number of them in his capacity as mayor of South Bend, Ind. There have been calls for his resignation in response to his handling of the city's police department after a white sergeant fatally shot a black resident on Father's Day.    Some might argue that Buttigieg's time would be better spent meeting with voters in his own community rather than jetting around in a pointless effort to become \"\"president of the whole country\"\" at age 37. Instead, he appears on national television to suggest that people who could never afford private air travel but nevertheless insist on eating hamburgers and using plastic straws are \"\"part of the problem.\"\"    Meanwhile, another Democratic candidate with absolutely no shot at winning the party's nomination, failed Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, is desperately seeking attention by live-blogging his 4-hour bus ride from New York to Boston.        Beto O\u2019Rourke spox says that he is indeed taking the Bolt bus from NY to Boston bc it pollutes less. Airport travel/security \"\"takes nearly every bit of time as the 4 hr Bolt ride \u2013 so why not choose the lower carbon option?\"\"        \u2014 Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 5, 2019        We left New Haven on time. pic.twitter.com/xDqCqhUN7g        \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 5, 2019        Folks.

H \"IT\u2019S \u201cABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES    Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy  Background:  What is a Use Case Model?   A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.    Preview of Our Future  Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect.   Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.      Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:  Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.      How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?  Planning Scenario:  In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their \u2018dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life.     Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us:   Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a \u2018trickle-up\u2019 community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.    Question: What is your community population?

It would be for news organizations to keep their YouTube comments CLOSED! At least until better moderation tools are available.    Analytics tools routinely show, news channel traffic today is largely suspect activity from red-flagged accounts. Nobody needs that sour nonsense. It\u2019s not journalism, it\u2019s not newsworthy, and you shouldn\u2019t let the sheer volume of it drown out your reporting.    If someone is telling you comments drive news channel engagement, they are wrong. Viewbots talking to botnets talking to synthetic puppet accounts is not real engagement. Neither is a few low-information voters parroting the propaganda accounts. Maybe listen to your human audience, who grow increasingly tired of this bad situation. And ad-buyers routinely demand bill reductions based on suspect traffic percentages, so the current comment situation makes no financial sense either.    The only thing open unmoderated comments accomplish is to hand over your popular platform, and the audience you\u2019ve cultivated, to any well-organized propaganda campaign for free. You wouldn\u2019t give free airtime to North Korea State Broadcasting or to a domestic competitor over cable or the airwaves, so it makes zero sense that you\u2019re doing so online!    Do the right thing, like other news channels, and keep these comments closed. Or come up with moderation strategies, like those of some news outlets who keep inappropriate activity from reaching publication in the first place.    But as long as your comments remain overrun by ads for sketchy online pills (or sunglasses, or cryptocurrency), and by off-topic conspiracy nonsense, by fake news, by adolescents (or socially challenged adults) spewing obscenity for the sake of obscenity, by bullying and by targeted harassment directed at protected categories, by trolls, spam, and foreign propaganda\u2026 it would be better to keep the comments closed.

H \"IT\u2019S \u201cABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID\u201d    Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy  By Mountainview2.CA  It's interesting don\u2019t you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the \u2018Manufacturing Consent\u2019 of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.        Background:  What is a Use Case Model?   A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals.       Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:  Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect.   Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.      Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:  Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.      How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?  Planning Scenario:  In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their \u2018dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life.       Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us:   Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a \u2018trickle-up\u2019 community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.      Economic Prognosis:   Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation.     Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

That means cost can go down because the market outside of the United States does not allow for price hikes. Also  if there is single payer then the insurance companies would need to become more savvy in terms of what they do offer  for example they could offer catastrophic health coverage  like for stage 4 cancer  or coverage for things like round the clock hospice care  or round the clock care in general. My guess is there will be areas of health care that a single payer system just would not be able to cover  so insurance companies could go for that business.  Good thing is because the market would be so competitive the costs would be lower.  Also  insurance companies could also transition into industries like investment in community hospitals for low income and rural areas because regardless of single payer or not  if you cannot reach a hospital or clinic then the plan you have sucks.

This is a phrase Buttigieg uses to deflect legitimate concerns about him, especially when it comes to being influenced by big money.  Interestingly, now that he\u2019s realizing that phrase doesn\u2019t magically make the issues go away, he\u2019s switching positions. Two examples:      Example 1 \u2013 FINANCIAL BUNDLER disclosure.  When people took issue with Buttigieg being the only major candidate who refused to disclose the names of his financial bundlers he said that request was a \u201cpurity test\u201d that was \u201cgetting us off focus of what really matters.\u201d      Example 2 \u2013 CLOSED DOOR FUNDRAISERS.  People took issue with Buttigieg for being the only major candidate still holding private fundraisers (in other words, if you aren\u2019t rich enough to attend, you don\u2019t get to know what is actually being said and promised).  What did he call those concerns?  You guessed it.  \u201cPurity Tests\u201d    The SWITCH \u2013 After smugly dismissing those two issues as \u201cpurity\u201d tests, Buttigieg switched his position and agreed to disclose the names of his financial bundlers and promised to stop having closed door fundraisers.  We\u2019ll see if he actually follows through with that.      Now don\u2019t get me wrong.  I\u2019m glad he switched positions, but what it took (a public knee-capping at the last debates) is concerning.  I mean, shouldn\u2019t a guy as \u201cdown to earth\u201d and \u201cmiddle America\u201d as Pete Buttigieg be in touch enough to know that the last thing we wanted to hear was:     \u201cSorry average American citizen, but you do not get to know the names of the people who solicit money for me.  You do not get to know who they used to work for or who they used to lobby for.  And if you can\u2019t afford my closed-door fund raisers?  You damn sure don\u2019t get to know what I say and promise to these influential people behind closed doors.  Oh yea, and if you open your mouth about it? I\u2019ll roll my eyes and smugly dismiss it as a purity test like I did at the debates.  Then when I realize my magic phrase didn\u2019t work\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll do a 180.\u201d    2. Health Care \u2013 Pete kicked off his campaign championing Medicare For All. Then, after raking in money from hospital, insurance and pharma (second only to Joe Biden), he now supports a \u201cpublic option\u201d and attacks Medicare for All with Republican talking points.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iia_SzsbTMQ (this video that is NOT an opinion piece.  It is a timeline of tweets and clips from Pete himself)    3. Donator Class \u2013 Buttigieg leads all candidates in billionaire donors.  This might not seem like a big deal to you but do you REALLY think these billionaire elites donate to candidates who will vote against their interests?     4.  Attempts to Disguise his Donator Class \u2013 After the knee-capping he got from the other candidates at the last debate for having the highest average donation, guess what Good Ole Middle America Pete Buttigieg did?    He held an online contest to see who could give him the SMALLEST donations!  Yes, in an effort to drive down his average donation and appear more grassroots, he literally asked his base to make smaller, more frequent donations.  Watch this for proof:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMbG33lgC2Y     And for all you Buttigieg supporters about to bombard me with the \u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything illegal\u201d argument don\u2019t bother.  My problem with it isn\u2019t the legality.  My problem is it\u2019s deceptive. You can\u2019t downplay issues of a higher financial class of donors as a \u201cpurity test\u201d and at the same time attempt to disguise the fact that you do indeed have the highest financial class of donors.  He\u2019s a shape-shifting fraud and he thinks we don\u2019t see it.    5. Does Not Believe Peoples\u2019 Votes Should Absolutely Count -  By that, I mean Pete Buttigieg does not support the idea that Superdelegates should vote according to how the precinct they represent actually voted.  He has already aggressively pursued the support of Super Delegates BEFORE the actual primary election: https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-campaign-aggressively-courts-Superdelegates-in-preparation-for-a-contested-convention     Why is Pete\u2019s courting of superdelegates a problem?  Read on:    A Superdelegate is a person whose single vote counts for 10,000 regular votes.  In theory, a superdelegate is supposed to vote according to the will of the district he represents.  But that\u2019s not a law (as we found out the hard way in the 2016 election.    In 2016, Tulsi Gabbard stepped down as the DNC chair because she realized superdelegates were actually pledging their support to Hillary Clinton PRIOR to their district\u2019s election. (the Wikileaks emails confirmed Gabbard\u2019s accusations).  This is exactly what Buttigieg is attempting to do already.    Despite Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s public exposure of the problem, the 2016 Superdelegates remained loyal to Hillary Clinton.  Many of them placed their 10,000 votes for Hillary Clinton even though their particular precinct voted for Sanders! In fact, Bernie Sanders won the majority of votes in certain states but lost those states because of superdelegates.  The process was rigged for Hilary Clinton.    The good news is that Gabbard's criticism of the process forced the DNC to \"\"reform\"\" their primary rules for 2020.  The bad news is that they reformed the rules as follows:    Beginning in 2020, a super delegate must vote according to the precinct they represent\u2026\u2026\u2026IN THE FIRST ROUND ONLY. (you didn't really expect the DNC establishment Neolibs to actually give up power did you?)    So how does the DNC establishment maintain control through the \u201creformed\u201d Superdelegate system?  Simple:      They flood the field with so many candidates that it is impossible to get a majority (50% or higher) winner in the first round to force a second round\u2026\u2026and that is exactly what they\u2019ve done.  Have you ever seen so many candidates?    The establishment handpicked a female (Harris) and a gay vet (Buttigieg) and an old white guy with name recognition (Biden).  With those three out there, nobody is getting 50% and a second round will become reality.    Enter the DNC establishment control.  In the second round, the Superdelegates no longer have to vote according to the will of the people.  Instead they deliver the candidate they promised the establishment DNC (who made them superdelegates to begin with).    The problem is the DNC establishment is old and out of touch.  They underestimated the power of easily accessible information.  They began to understand it when Tulsi Gabbard absolutely knee-capped Kamala Harris with fact after fact at the 2nd Debate.  People did their research despite Google\u2019s attempt to prevent it (addressed in final paragraph), and Harris was cooked.    Now that Harris is gone, DNC establishment\u2019s attempt to force a second round is not as inevitable.    But even if there is a second round.  Do any of you Buttigieg supporters think it\u2019s o.k. for him to secure superdelegate votes if the people from that precinct didn\u2019t actually vote for him?       Let me rephrase that question:  Would any of you Buttigieg supporters think it\u2019s o.k. if YOUR precinct voted for Buttigieg overwhelmingly in the first round but at the second round, YOUR superdelegate flipped his 10,000 votes and delivered your precinct to Elizabeth Warren because they had struck a deal already?  (This phrasing should help you guys avoid the \u201cbut it\u2019s legal\u201d or \u201cpurity test\u201d argument.)     I think 100% of you would say, \u201cHell no.  That is wrong.

Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance  inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked\u00a0so viscously and mercilessly each time  like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party?\u00a0      Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power.\u00a0  It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts,\u00a0they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.\u00a0 If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch?\u00a0  The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right?\u00a0  If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate.\u00a0  Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.\u00a0\u00a0  By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.\u00a0 Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?\" ", "Bean Massah": "She always looks like she really has to fart ", "Thana KR": "Good ", "Ryan Jing": "f a i r   a n d   o b j e c t i v e   r e p o r t i n g ", "Mikael Wells": "They\u2019re both about as adequate as a clogged toilet.

Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance  inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked\u00a0so viscously and mercilessly each time  like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party?\u00a0      Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power.\u00a0      It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts,\u00a0they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.\u00a0 If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch?\u00a0      The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right?\u00a0  If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate.\u00a0      Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.\u00a0\u00a0      By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.\u00a0 Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?\" ", "Ahmad Alsmadi": "\"Twist your words however you want #wallstreetpete  we will not choose a candidate that is bought by billionaires.\" ", "Tony Tate": "\"Gay President yes   Gay Vice President yes   Pete Buttigieg NO!

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

 we also have public transportation system with over 200 lines (bus, trolley, trams etc) and over 2500 vehicles covering them in a city of 2 million people. you get a monthly pass for 30$ (employed) and 10$ (unemployed and students). pensioners and children ride for free. we have also very good intercity transport system designed in the same way. rides are longer and some prices are higher (dependent on the length of the line) but it averages out.  and we are (by your standards) a poor, tiny nation of under 10 million people total.  we have better post natal care, less death rate and longer lives. we are healthy and not obese. our food markets are exclusively organic as we have never known any other way to grow food. yeah you can buy \"\"plastic tomatoes\"\" and processed meat in supermarkets but that is only for fools and lazy people.  ffs, our average junk food burger is 250g (1/4 of 1 Kg) of pure beef that has never seen antibiotics and hormones. and it costs from 1.5$ to 2.5$ (depends on how fancy the establishment is, if you are eating inside or takeout, if they butcher themselves and like).  i am shocked how much you have and how lousy you are treating your wealth and health. both physical and mental.  i make about 15k$ per year (after taxes and everything else) but could make double if i wanted to. i just love my company and colleagues and am not greedy. i have 8h work days, 5 days per week, spend only 70% of that time actually doing something (rest is lunch, hanging out and taking breaks). company provides me with everything i need for work. i just have to ask.  does that sound like utopia?  well it isn't. do you want to know why?  because since 1980. your country has done everything to ruin mine. they lied, bribed, cheated some nationalist bastards into power and then created 2 fake wars and vilified the very name of my country in spite of evidence to the contrary. your media says one thing, facts say another.  only in the past decade we have been slowly pulling from it because you are losing power and can't pressure other nations to do your bidding...  and like a fool i have been warning you on the internet for years to watch what your politicians are doing to you. dividing you up in two camps heading for collision course. you are losing the battle with climate change (and blame it on CO2 instead on CF4 and CH4) while we have fertile farmland, clear rivers and 70% of land covered in forests. pure, untouched nature we have been enjoying for thousands of years. our climate hasn't changed. i parsed the data from meteorological services (we have free access to data on their website for past 70 years) and, if you disregard 12 year solar cycle, there is only 0.5^C degree increase of temperature on average and precipitation has moved 2 weeks later but remains in the same amount per year.  i have parsed the data from noaa for your farmlands. largest increase in temperature and precipitation on the planet together with most flooding and hurricane type storms. well done. you destroyed what you have stolen. few rich people always think they will be able to get out before it gets really bad.  that's capitalism for you...  also, because you have pushed around every single nation on the planet in the past 70 years, nobody likes you and will reflect your immigrant policy when you start running from either Civil War 2.0: Samba de Trumpenero or when, finally, one flood hits just one of over 20 nuclear plants that are in your farmland and flood zones, and they do keep their whole spent fuel rods right in their cooling pools because you haven't still made a dumping site for that.  i have called again and again for you to think of your children, think of their future, what legacy you are making but have only been greeted with ridicule (at best) despite facts that support everything i said. as a scientist i am glad i proved myself right and stayed here and turned down that berkeley offer in the early 90's. it was the right choice. hope you make one too and think based on facts and not belief as belief is, by definition, taking something as truth without evidence for it. ie. living in a lie.  so listen or don't, i am doing my best to warn you, again and again. it is up to you what you want to do with it...\" ", "2019-10-23T12:42:14.000Z": "John Tembo Pete uttering nonsense ", "2019-10-23T11:51:48.000Z": "Edward Palmore \"Mayor Pete is a brilliant  articulate young man.

This is a simple fact of demographics, and no doubt why Pete is trying hard to show people of colour that he's ready to champion them.

On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.        Background:  What is a Use Case Model?   A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals.       Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:  Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect.   Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.      Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:  Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.      How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?  Planning Scenario:  In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their \u2018dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life.       Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us:   Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a \u2018trickle-up\u2019 community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.      Economic Prognosis:   Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation.

The 1.5 Trillion he is talking about \"\"paying for\"\" isn't paying for health care  it's to pay for creating a government insurance company. The care is paid for by us  through premiums to either his or private insurance companies  they use those premiums to pay for the care + more to administer the insurance side of things. With both Bernie and Warren's plans  they are finding ways to pay for our actual health care needs. The role that Pete has \"\"paid for\"\" here doesn't exist in their plans.

For care  he is ignoring that at the government level so everyone is on their own but giving them an extra option to evaluate while Bernie and Warren have each come up with different ways(via various taxes targeted in different ways) to pool resources as a country and get everyone care when they need it.  An example for someone making 60k as a w-2 employee. Pete's plan is about 5k(depending on the plan  you'd have copays and deductibles when you need it  the 5k is just the premium)  no direct new taxes. Warren's plan: no premiums  no copays or deductibles  no direct new taxes.  Bernie's Plan  no premiums  no copays or deductibles  2400 in direct payroll taxes.

Wow.       Rachel R.

Yet we have heard nothing from his campaign.      So they put out a list of black South Carolinians who supposedly endorse him, but most of them are confused because they did NOT endorse him, almost half the list is white, and they used stock photos from Kenya.

He was the subject of an excessive force settlement in 2014. He was accused of misconduct in his arrest of a Notre Dame football player in 2016. Activists in town launched a \u201cFire Knepper\u201d campaign that year. Buttigieg \u2014 who has been a surprise standout in the 2020 presidential race  often boasting about leading one of the country\u2019s \u201cbest-run\u201d cities \u2014 said there\u2019s nothing he can do about it. At a Townhall when Buttigieg was able to get a word in  he made a promise: \u201cIf anyone on patrol is shown to be a racist or to do something racist in a way that is substantiated  that is their last day on the street \u201d he vowed. And yet  he argued  the firing of individual police officers is something he does not control. \u201cThe key thing is this: When it comes to the Board of Public Safety  he appoints all them. So the responsibility is through his appointment. Buttigieg\u2019s office confirmed that the mayor has the power to fire any board members and confirmed that all current members of the board were appointed by Buttigieg.Amid outrage from the black community  Boykins quickly rescinded his resignation; Buttigieg instead demoted Boykins to work with the city\u2019s young people and later called his handling of the situation his \u201cfirst serious mistake as mayor.\u201d At the time  Buttigieg said he fired Boykins for his role in the secret recording of some police phone lines  which federal investigators were looking into. In April  when Buttigieg was asked about the situation  he said at a CNN town hall  \u201cThe reason I demoted the chief was that I found out that he was the subject of a criminal investigation  not from him but from the FBI  and it made it very hard for me to trust him as one of my own appointees. It was frustrating and painful too.\u201d   The recording system had long predated Boykins  who sued the city for racial discrimination  winning a $50 000 settlement. Buttigieg has said he has never been legally able to listen to what is on those secret tape recordings. Karen DePaepe  a city official who listened in on the lines and transferred the conversations to tapes to preserve the ones she thought were most important  said in 2012 that what she overheard suggested seriously unethical behavior by police officers  including the use of racist language in relation to Boykins. DePaepe  the only person known to have listened to significant portions of the controversial recordings  was also fired by Buttigieg for her role in the affair and subsequently sued the city and won a $235 000 settlement; she has not commented on the contents of the tapes since. What was said on them has remained a closely held secret. DePaepe alleged in legal documents that  over the span of several months  white officers discussed at length a plan to persuade Buttigieg to fire Boykins  using two Buttigieg donors as go-betweens. \u201cIt is going to be a fun time when all white people are in charge \u201d one officer is quoted saying.In June  according to DePaepe  after an officer talked with Buttigieg  the conclusion was that \u201cBoykins is done.\u201d  Buttigieg has since said that the episode \u2014 which unfolded as the city\u2019s residents were marching to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin \u2014 strained his relationship to the black community in an enduring way. The small-town mayor has done no better with black voters in his presidential bid  consistently polling close to zero among African Americans. No one needs to hear what is in your heart. Your actions shows what is coming from your heart. The black communities have no use for this closet bigot. Buttigieg will not farewell in S.C. and Super-Tuesday.
