'' ''  he will never be respected among the black african-american communities because of the traditional 'black man ' role model , they are traditionally very proud of a 'manhood ' leader and their families or their communities or their sport teams that require a very strong man or role model in the group . they have always look down upon gays as not fitting that strong role model image or looked down upon as weak and not manly or tough enough to solve their social problems or lead them into prosperity .  `` `` we are the only country in the world with more guns than people , '' '' he said . `` `` it has not made us safer . we can respect the second amendment ( on gun rights ) , and not allow it to be a death sentence for thousands of americans .

'cupcake ' ) , mayor of south bend , indiana , with a population of 101,000 is conveniently mute about his lack of accomplishment there . ( for example , the crime rate there is 120 % higher than the national average , the homeless rate is even worst . ) he is simply running on his widely unpopular sexual preference , which most people find it disgusting and have little interest in , or would choose not to know anything about due to its unhealthy and filthy nature . he will be one of the first to fall off the list of potential candidates running in the democratic primary , guaranteed  now that he 's come out , he/she can go home . people who do n't understand their gender should n't be governing the rest of us . they can live with each other just not around me . enjoy your life . come to think of it , he does look like neuman the ugly cartoon character . he was sixteen years old and well into puberty and he did n't know he was gay ! . no doubt in anyone 's mind and support for the conclusion to those who say you are n't born that way , you chose to be that way . the identity politics of shaming people for disliking aberrant behavior . so predictable .  the lgbtq people ( only 4 % of the population ) tends to portray its group as victims . they choose that type of filthy lifestyle . when people do n't agree with their lifestyle ( lgbtq ) , they are labeled as bigots . pete said `` '' creating a crisis of belonging for people of color , immigrants , gay people and others .  cupcake dude ! , you got it exactly backwards . the identity mindset and politics of the liberal socialists left or social justice warriors , obsessed with promoting people of color , immigrants , muslims , felons , illegal aliens , homeless , deadbeats , ex-criminals and gay people beyond any rational and patriotic boundary to the point of detriment to everybody else and even those groups themselves ( see pathological altruism ) , created the crises of belonging for the rest of us . it 's one of the key and main reasons why donald trump was elected . hillary on the other hand had everything for people of color , immigrants and gays . she had nothing but contempt for flyover working class america .  basically all this guy has to run on is that he 's gay and somehow ( in true democrat form ) he has twisted some text in the bible to justify his practice of man on man filthy unsafe love . marriage is still just between a man and a woman . most people do n't give a da__ , what the man-made liberal minded crooked courts determined !  pete the cupcake has chosen to run on his sexual preference and if elected he would see his election as a mandated to serve based on his sexual preference , which would mean he represents only a small part of american society . embracing perversion is not heroic it 's hedonistic .  gay president buttigieg ( a.k.a . cupcake , neuman , feathers , fruit-fly , donald duck , tinkerbelle ) and his first mate , or lady or whatever . that will not help us to gain back respect from the world . as soon as he/she is president he/she will appoint many transvestites as his close advisors and put more gays and lesbians in the military . the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon will run for cover and the special forces will quit or retire early . gay pete will not be able to negotiate anything in foreign policy with the russians , korea , the middle east ( muslims ) , africa and even many south american and central america countries where they do n't respect homosexuals . there are way too many countries and religions that do not tolerate homosexuals so what was this mayor pete thinking when he decided to run ? he must have been in a fantasy wishful thinking mode ! wake up ! pete , the world outside the usa is very different and intolerant  when is the world going to stop justifying all this sex changing mentally unstable celebrities and their filthy lifestyles and look at the real psychological reasons why these people chose to do this . the fact is most people that have sex identity problems need serious long term psychotherapy .  in the usa 1.7 percent of the adult population identifies as gay or lesbian . another 1.8 percent of the us adult population identifies as bisexual . that leaves 97 percent of the usa 's adult population identifies as straight , without an identity problem and able to reproduce like normal people .   the gay community demands to be treated as equal but does n't support any other orientation and wants special privileges and respect from 97 % of the population . we set aside an entire month to celebrate a union of two people who can not create a next generation and represent less than 5 % of the us population . but a parade for `` '' straight '' '' people is a problem for them ? their double standards is without merit . respect is something you earn , but they have n't earn it yet from the 97 % , or the rest of us  how can the city of boston can deny the application , based on what justification ? . if they do - we would expect the aclu and other civil rights groups to have a hissy fit . this is not hate for `` '' pride '' '' it is about equal rights and celebrating your sexual orientation - we all have a right to peaceful assembly - right ? that 's what protects all of us .   narcissistic personality disorder and depression is a very serious disorders that should be taken far more seriously within the transgender community . by their own report , 80 % of transgender attempt suicide some time in their life . to me , that sounds deadly serious and is enough proof beyond any doubt that these people need psychiatric treatment at an early age .   when the world stops idolizing and promoting this type of extreme mental disorder , and narcissistic personality disorder , then and only then will they will seek a good psychiatrist . there should be a military draft for all this people and they should put them in the front line in a real intense bloody battle against the enemy and show a video of their behavior , then and only then is the world is going to realized how useless they are for the rest of us normal citizens and for society in general . is bad enough that two people of the same sex can not reproduce children and therefore should never be given a marriage license but due to political corruption and decadence of our society and due to the ignorance of the electorate voters , this new trend has grown to the detriment of moral values , common sense and rational thinking .  one day in the future it will be exposed and confirm that this trans-sexual movement and same sex marriage was a horrible moment in world history and human reproductive progress due to the newly discovered reality by medical science and rational politicians that they have a serious mental disorder . future society and future generations will agreed that these people are a very bad ideal human model and should not be tolerated or justify and in fact it is detrimental to an ideal healthy reproductive society . the treatment will change to therapy and possibly a new drug . that time will come because the rational majority , the ones not under media hype and pc control see thru the bullsheet and the false justification and irrational thinking .  homosexual relationships are not marriage and will never be consider by normal people as a healthy human model relationship . that is , they simply do not fit the minimum necessary condition for a marriage to exist -- namely , the union of a reproductive man and a woman that can form a family by their biological fertility .  the second is that homosexual relationships are proven harmful . not only do they not provide the same benefits to a healthy society as heterosexual marriages , but their consequences are far more negative than positive.either argument , standing alone , is sufficient to reject the claim that same-sex unions should be granted the legal status of marriage .  anticipating some negative feedback from this proven true , qualified , confirmed and rational opinion from all the ' cup cake butterflies ' out there , it is very self serving for them to justify their behavior , of course their opinion does n't have any weight or merit since most of them are not part of normal society and will be disregarded as biased , under mental disorder and handicapped feedback .

( but i certainly wish him every success in finding a way to solve the crisis . ) my first issue ... i have to question the realistic ability of america to curtail the current situation regarding the rapidly declining global environment and the resulting global climate changes or as this presidential hopeful calls it 'climate security . ' my second issue ... is the optimistic desire to continue to open the american borders to those desperate people fleeing for their lives while there is no money available anymore for the american government to finance the increasing numbers of immigrants arriving every year . if you consider that the global population was 1 billion in 1919 and it is now over 8 billion in 2019 ( at that rate there will be over 16 billion people on the planet in 50 years ) how exactly is america supposed to continue to support an increasing number of these immigrants ... to pay for their food clothing and shelter needs their transportation needs medical needs and education year after year because there are no jobs available in america for these immigrants to support themselves . if you consider america is over 20 trillion dollars in debt in 2019 and paying over 500 billion dollars every year in debt interest every year . there is no money left to save everyone else when tens of millions of jobless and homeless americans are desperate and struggling to save themselves . he says dollars can not drown out the will of the people but unfortunately 'money talks . ' good intentions do not pay the bills and america is bankrupt there needs to be someone honest enough to say no to immigrant demanding that they be allowed to live in america and have all of their bills paid for by the american people year after year after year because tens millions of jobs in america have been replaced forever by slave labour in china and india by more and more efficient roboitic assembly lines and the latest cost saving technology consuming americas jobs . the decline of the economy has reduced the number of americans working and as a result the taxes paid to the government have drastically declined as well ... there simply is no money anymore for the government to financilly support hundreds of thousand of immigrants for years and years especially with so many millions of americans doing without . with regard to the climate i suppose america can try to be a positive role model and do it 's part to stop polluting in america and try to repair the damage where possible across america but the reality is climate change is a global crisis and when countries all ver the globe are dumping billions of tons of toxic pollution into the water and the air ... . it seems like a lost cause and beyond americas control . ( consider the japanese government has recently approved dumping another 700000 tons of boiling hot nuclear wast into the ocean from the nuclear reactors that were destroyed by the 2011 tsunami and that is in addition to the 1000000 tons of nuclear waste that have already been dumped into the ocean since the disaster of 2011 . of course america can point fingers and explain how such actions are warming the oceans and are a threat to the survival of the planet but there is quite simply no way to stop japan or any other country from doing whatever it wants . ) america can only clean up it 's own back yard and prevent their environment from being exploited by global corporation bent on making money at any cost . take for example the swiss owned company nestle that has been exploiting americas fresh water natural resources for decades . while the global temperatures increase to record highs and drought chokes america and burns it 's cities to the ground because of a lack of water nestle keeps it 's eye on the profits to be made and continues to mine the underground water table only paying the american government 3 or 4 dollars for a million gallons of it 's precious fresh drinking water ( as a matter of fact untouchable nestle continues to mine billions of gallons of water every year across america even when their permits have expired ... none of the towns being exploited have the money to dare to take on nestles massive legal team . ) billions of gallons of americas precious fresh drinking water are bottled and then sold to americans with the billions in profits going to switzerland . the rest of the world is left with hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic plastic bottles polluting the environent . maybe that is something america could change and help save the planet but it is just a drop in the bucket and sadly i think it is a lost cause . ( deep sigh ... clearly i got carried away . what can i say i just love this planet and it really is sad to see how tragic the situation is today . hopefully this presidential hopeful can shine his light and inspire the rest of the world to be more aware and take advantage of the one last chance the planet has to recover . and perhaps he can find a way to stop the decades of rampant greed and corruption that has destroyed the american dream and set the american economy back on track . who knows once america is booming again there could be money available for the government to welcome immigrants into the country and they will be able to work and support themselves . that would seem to be the plan so i will try and stay positive and start by saying god bless pete buttigieg and god bless america . ) ''", "Ramblequist": "comment time: 2019-04-15T14:26:36.000Z platitudes", "Jebster Sr": "comment time: 2019-04-15T14:14:55.000Z we already had our first fudge packer & tonsil hockey president in barack obummer ...", "Alex Gavin": "comment time: 2019-04-15T14:12:48.000Z `` oh no is that barbara ?

''  at jesse jackson 's rainbow push conference on tuesday 2 juuy 2019 , buttigieg whined that the media keep pestering about his abysmal poll numbers with black democrats , who will likely make up 60 % of the electorate in south carolina 's critical first-in-the-south primary that will make or break many candidacies .  `` i am asked how i 'm going to earn the black vote in the polls ten times more often than how my policies would benefit black americans , '' buttigieg reportedly said . `` it 's as if i 'm being asked more about how to win than how to deserve to win . ''  then in what may have been another tone-deaf moment for an egghead candidate who has been criticized as being the epitome of a `` briefing-book democrat '' who is unable to empathize with various constituencies , buttigieg said that black democrats `` need to understand the details '' of his douglass plan for black america .  after a white south bend police officer , who did not have his body camera turned on , killed a black resident , buttigieg , who had already lost the trust of many black residents when he demoted the city 's first black police chief because he secretly recored white officers allegedly making racist comments , was slammed for bungling the situation even though he left the campaign trail for a few days to address the police shooting . the washington post noted that `` instead of showcasing buttigieg 's ability to lead through a crisis , '' the south bend shooting `` is exposing what has long been considered an achilles ' heel of his candidacy : his frosty relationship with south bend 's black residents . ''  buttigieg reportedly `` alienated the family of the dead man , eric logan '' when he spoke to the media before the family , `` skipped a vigil at the scene of the shooting , and sought advice from outsiders , including the rev . al sharpton of new york . '' buttigieg has been panned for not being able to name black activists in south bend who support him , and the post noted that to many of buttigieg 's detractors , his actions after the shooting again showed that `` he still does n't get it . ''  oliver davis , `` the longest-serving black member of the south bend common council , '' told the post : `` how 's he handling it ? . well , he talked to the media before the family . he skipped the family vigil , full of black residents . and then he then gave a speech to the police . so , how do you think that went over ? ''  while addressing protesters , buttigieg seemed out of his depth and had another awkward interaction with activists while speaking with a bullhorn even though activists were just a few feet away from him .  `` you 're running for president ? and you want black people to vote for you ? that 's not gon na happen , '' a female black resident shouted at buttigieg , who responded , `` i 'm not asking for your vote . ''  `` you 're not gon na get it , either , '' the activist then replied .  when asked during last week 's debate why south bend 's police department did not have more people of color , buttigieg replied : `` because i could n't get it done .

''  at jesse jackson 's rainbow push conference on tuesday 2 juuy 2019 , buttigieg whined that the media keep pestering about his abysmal poll numbers with black democrats , who will likely make up 60 % of the electorate in south carolina 's critical first-in-the-south primary that will make or break many candidacies .  `` i am asked how i 'm going to earn the black vote in the polls ten times more often than how my policies would benefit black americans , '' buttigieg reportedly said . `` it 's as if i 'm being asked more about how to win than how to deserve to win . ''  then in what may have been another tone-deaf moment for an egghead candidate who has been criticized as being the epitome of a `` briefing-book democrat '' who is unable to empathize with various constituencies , buttigieg said that black democrats `` need to understand the details '' of his douglass plan for black america .  after a white south bend police officer , who did not have his body camera turned on , killed a black resident , buttigieg , who had already lost the trust of many black residents when he demoted the city 's first black police chief because he secretly recored white officers allegedly making racist comments , was slammed for bungling the situation even though he left the campaign trail for a few days to address the police shooting . the washington post noted that `` instead of showcasing buttigieg 's ability to lead through a crisis , '' the south bend shooting `` is exposing what has long been considered an achilles ' heel of his candidacy : his frosty relationship with south bend 's black residents . ''  buttigieg reportedly `` alienated the family of the dead man , eric logan '' when he spoke to the media before the family , `` skipped a vigil at the scene of the shooting , and sought advice from outsiders , including the rev . al sharpton of new york . '' buttigieg has been panned for not being able to name black activists in south bend who support him , and the post noted that to many of buttigieg 's detractors , his actions after the shooting again showed that `` he still does n't get it . ''  oliver davis , `` the longest-serving black member of the south bend common council , '' told the post : `` how 's he handling it ? . well , he talked to the media before the family . he skipped the family vigil , full of black residents . and then he then gave a speech to the police . so , how do you think that went over ? ''  while addressing protesters , buttigieg seemed out of his depth and had another awkward interaction with activists while speaking with a bullhorn even though activists were just a few feet away from him .  `` you 're running for president ? and you want black people to vote for you ? that 's not gon na happen , '' a female black resident shouted at buttigieg , who responded , `` i 'm not asking for your vote . ''  `` you 're not gon na get it , either , '' the activist then replied .  when asked during last week 's debate why south bend 's police department did not have more people of color , buttigieg replied : `` because i could n't get it done .

''  example 2 closed door fundraisers . people took issue with buttigieg for being the only major candidate still holding private fundraisers ( in other words , if you are n't rich enough to attend , you do n't get to know what is actually being said and promised ) . what did he call those concerns ? you guessed it . `` purity tests ''  the switch after smugly dismissing those two issues as `` purity '' tests , buttigieg switched his position and agreed to disclose the names of his financial bundlers and promised to stop having closed door fundraisers . we 'll see if he actually follows through with that .  now do n't get me wrong . i 'm glad he switched positions , but what it took ( a public knee-capping at the last debates ) is concerning . i mean , should n't a guy as `` down to earth '' and `` middle america '' as pete buttigieg be in touch enough to know that the last thing we wanted to hear was :  `` sorry average american citizen , but you do not get to know the names of the people who solicit money for me . you do not get to know who they used to work for or who they used to lobby for . and if you ca n't afford my closed-door fund raisers ? you damn sure do n't get to know what i say and promise to these influential people behind closed doors . oh yea , and if you open your mouth about it ? i 'll roll my eyes and smugly dismiss it as a purity test like i did at the debates . then when i realize my magic phrase did n't work i 'll do a 180 . ''  2 . health care pete kicked off his campaign championing medicare for all . then , after raking in money from hospital , insurance and pharma ( second only to joe biden ) , he now supports a `` public option '' and attacks medicare for all with republican talking points . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iia_szsbtmq ( this video that is not an opinion piece . it is a timeline of tweets and clips from pete himself )  3 . donator class buttigieg leads all candidates in billionaire donors . this might not seem like a big deal to you but do you really think these billionaire elites donate to candidates who will vote against their interests ?  4 . attempts to disguise his donator class after the knee-capping he got from the other candidates at the last debate for having the highest average donation , guess what good ole middle america pete buttigieg did ?  he held an online contest to see who could give him the smallest donations ! yes , in an effort to drive down his average donation and appear more grassroots , he literally asked his base to make smaller , more frequent donations . watch this for proof : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gmbg33lgc2y  and for all you buttigieg supporters about to bombard me with the `` he 's not doing anything illegal '' argument do n't bother . my problem with it is n't the legality . my problem is it 's deceptive . you ca n't downplay issues of a higher financial class of donors as a `` purity test '' and at the same time attempt to disguise the fact that you do indeed have the highest financial class of donors . he 's a shape-shifting fraud and he thinks we do n't see it .  5 . does not believe peoples ' votes should absolutely count - by that , i mean pete buttigieg does not support the idea that superdelegates should vote according to how the precinct they represent actually voted . he has already aggressively pursued the support of super delegates before the actual primary election : https : //www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-campaign-aggressively-courts-superdelegates-in-preparation-for-a-contested-convention  why is pete 's courting of superdelegates a problem ? read on :  a superdelegate is a person whose single vote counts for 10,000 regular votes . in theory , a superdelegate is supposed to vote according to the will of the district he represents . but that 's not a law ( as we found out the hard way in the 2016 election .  in 2016 , tulsi gabbard stepped down as the dnc chair because she realized superdelegates were actually pledging their support to hillary clinton prior to their district 's election . ( the wikileaks emails confirmed gabbard 's accusations ) . this is exactly what buttigieg is attempting to do already .  despite tulsi gabbard 's public exposure of the problem , the 2016 superdelegates remained loyal to hillary clinton . many of them placed their 10,000 votes for hillary clinton even though their particular precinct voted for sanders ! in fact , bernie sanders won the majority of votes in certain states but lost those states because of superdelegates . the process was rigged for hilary clinton .  the good news is that gabbard 's criticism of the process forced the dnc to `` '' reform '' '' their primary rules for 2020 . the bad news is that they reformed the rules as follows :  beginning in 2020 , a super delegate must vote according to the precinct they represent in the first round only . ( you did n't really expect the dnc establishment neolibs to actually give up power did you ? )  so how does the dnc establishment maintain control through the `` reformed '' superdelegate system ? simple :  they flood the field with so many candidates that it is impossible to get a majority ( 50 % or higher ) winner in the first round to force a second round and that is exactly what they 've done . have you ever seen so many candidates ?  the establishment handpicked a female ( harris ) and a gay vet ( buttigieg ) and an old white guy with name recognition ( biden ) . with those three out there , nobody is getting 50 % and a second round will become reality .  enter the dnc establishment control . in the second round , the superdelegates no longer have to vote according to the will of the people . instead they deliver the candidate they promised the establishment dnc ( who made them superdelegates to begin with ) .  the problem is the dnc establishment is old and out of touch . they underestimated the power of easily accessible information . they began to understand it when tulsi gabbard absolutely knee-capped kamala harris with fact after fact at the 2nd debate . people did their research despite google 's attempt to prevent it ( addressed in final paragraph ) , and harris was cooked .  now that harris is gone , dnc establishment 's attempt to force a second round is not as inevitable .  but even if there is a second round . do any of you buttigieg supporters think it 's o.k . for him to secure superdelegate votes if the people from that precinct did n't actually vote for him ?  let me rephrase that question : would any of you buttigieg supporters think it 's o.k . if your precinct voted for buttigieg overwhelmingly in the first round but at the second round , your superdelegate flipped his 10,000 votes and delivered your precinct to elizabeth warren because they had struck a deal already ? ( this phrasing should help you guys avoid the `` but it 's legal '' or `` purity test '' argument . )  i think 100 % of you would say , `` hell no . that is wrong . we voted for pete and our votes did n't count .

it seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attackedso viscously and mercilessly each time like clockwork . how does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party ?   whatever the justification , the reason is clear : it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color . by leaving the democratic party , they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics . if you stop thinking about yourself as an african-american , or muslim-american or hispanic-american , and start thinking about yourself as an american , then the left can not control you through fear anymore . they want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that republics are racists , and once you stop believing that , they lose all their power . it concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person , but as an individual with their own ideas that can not be defined by where they came from or how they look . they have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy , principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race . since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts , they can not be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power . in essence , they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly . and this scares the hell out of democrats , to the point of rage , because when people lose power they become angry . hence why democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race , but yet the democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear . if every black person thinks differently and independently , how will the democrats control the entire bunch ? the number one agenda of the democratic party is portray all white males , especially those in the republican party as inherent racist . and if you 're not racists then you 're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue . we see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs , even if only subtly alluded to . race underpins the discussions surrounding everything : sports , immigration , law enforcement , foreign policy , education , hollywood and even climate change . it is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change , right ?

well it is n't . do you want to know why ? because since 1980. your country has done everything to ruin mine . they lied , bribed , cheated some nationalist bastards into power and then created 2 fake wars and vilified the very name of my country in spite of evidence to the contrary . your media says one thing , facts say another . only in the past decade we have been slowly pulling from it because you are losing power and ca n't pressure other nations to do your bidding ... and like a fool i have been warning you on the internet for years to watch what your politicians are doing to you . dividing you up in two camps heading for collision course . you are losing the battle with climate change ( and blame it on co2 instead on cf4 and ch4 ) while we have fertile farmland , clear rivers and 70 % of land covered in forests . pure , untouched nature we have been enjoying for thousands of years . our climate has n't changed . i parsed the data from meteorological services ( we have free access to data on their website for past 70 years ) and , if you disregard 12 year solar cycle , there is only 0.5^c degree increase of temperature on average and precipitation has moved 2 weeks later but remains in the same amount per year . i have parsed the data from noaa for your farmlands . largest increase in temperature and precipitation on the planet together with most flooding and hurricane type storms . well done . you destroyed what you have stolen . few rich people always think they will be able to get out before it gets really bad . that 's capitalism for you ... also , because you have pushed around every single nation on the planet in the past 70 years , nobody likes you and will reflect your immigrant policy when you start running from either civil war 2.0 : samba de trumpenero or when , finally , one flood hits just one of over 20 nuclear plants that are in your farmland and flood zones , and they do keep their whole spent fuel rods right in their cooling pools because you have n't still made a dumping site for that . i have called again and again for you to think of your children , think of their future , what legacy you are making but have only been greeted with ridicule ( at best ) despite facts that support everything i said . as a scientist i am glad i proved myself right and stayed here and turned down that berkeley offer in the early 90 's . it was the right choice . hope you make one too and think based on facts and not belief as belief is , by definition , taking something as truth without evidence for it . ie . living in a lie . so listen or do n't , i am doing my best to warn you , again and again . it is up to you what you want to do with it ...

'' at the time buttigieg said he fired boykins for his role in the secret recording of some police phone lines which federal investigators were looking into . in april when buttigieg was asked about the situation he said at a cnn town hall `` the reason i demoted the chief was that i found out that he was the subject of a criminal investigation not from him but from the fbi and it made it very hard for me to trust him as one of my own appointees . it was frustrating and painful too . '' the recording system had long predated boykins who sued the city for racial discrimination winning a $ 50 000 settlement . buttigieg has said he has never been legally able to listen to what is on those secret tape recordings . karen depaepe a city official who listened in on the lines and transferred the conversations to tapes to preserve the ones she thought were most important said in 2012 that what she overheard suggested seriously unethical behavior by police officers including the use of racist language in relation to boykins . depaepe the only person known to have listened to significant portions of the controversial recordings was also fired by buttigieg for her role in the affair and subsequently sued the city and won a $ 235 000 settlement ; she has not commented on the contents of the tapes since . what was said on them has remained a closely held secret . depaepe alleged in legal documents that over the span of several months white officers discussed at length a plan to persuade buttigieg to fire boykins using two buttigieg donors as go-betweens . `` it is going to be a fun time when all white people are in charge `` one officer is quoted saying.in june according to depaepe after an officer talked with buttigieg the conclusion was that `` boykins is done .
