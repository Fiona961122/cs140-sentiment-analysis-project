'' the authenticity of the documents was verified by the city when it released redacted versions of them , as tytreportedon sept. 30 . tyt stands by its reporting . legal documents related to pete buttigieg 's ousting of south bend 's first black police chief describe a plan by white police officers in 2011 to use buttigieg 's campaign donors to get him to remove the chief , darryl boykins , once buttigieg became mayor . `` it is going to be a fun time when all white people are in charge , '' one officer is quoted as saying in the documents , which describe secret police recordings . the previously undisclosed documents shed new light on the most controversial chapter of buttigieg 's south bend political career . the documents describe a plan to use two buttigieg donors including his campaign chairman to lobby buttigieg on personnel changes at the south bend police department ( sbpd ) . both donors deny having such discussions with buttigieg . buttigieg campaign national press secretary chris meagher asked to see the documents , saying , `` you 're more than willing to report rumors you are unable to prove , so it 'd be nice to see some of this , '' but provided no further comment . the secret recordings of south bend police phone lines have been a source of intrigue and controversy since their existence was revealed in march 2012 , at the dawn of buttigieg 's mayoralty . speculation about the recordings and buttigieg 's refusal to release them has dogged him into his presidential campaign , while their contents have remained largely a mystery . buttigieg has said as recently as this year that he wants to know what was said on the recordings , but that he is not sure he can legally even ask the city employee who listened to them to describe what she heard . but the documents show that buttigieg 's lawyers secretly did just that in 2013 . lawyers for both boykins and for karen depaepe , the police employee who heard the recordings and was fired for her role in the scandal , would not comment on the content of the documents . both , however , confirmed to the young turks that the city has had a jan. 4 , 2012 , officer 's report filed by depaepe that details what she heard , and her written responses to city attorneys who asked her in 2013 what she heard . the responses the city got include comprehensive , detailed accounts of what is said on the recordings , describing a plan that unfolded over the course of buttigieg 's 2011 mayoral campaign . although their accuracy can not be confirmed without listening to the recordings , the documents ' authenticity was confirmed by sources familiar with the matter . ( in response to a public-records request , city officials confirmed possession of the officer 's report and released aredacted version ) . the documents say that , in february 2011 , two white police officers were heard discussing a campaign to get rid of boykins , with buttigieg donors acting as go-betweens . in april , the officers say they believe buttigieg is unaware of the plan , and that they expect the `` little fucking squirt , '' as one calls him , to win the mayoral nomination . after he does win , a third officer in june reports hearing directly from buttigieg that `` boykins is done . '' the documents indicate that current sbpd chief scott ruszkowski and the current county prosecutor , ken cotter , suggested to buttigieg replacements for boykins . the documents do n't say whether either man knew about the plan . some of the officers involved from both the sbpd and the county homicide unit ( made up of police from south bend and its suburbs ) allegedly discussed boykins in racist terms , using ebonics in reference to him and other black people . two black police officers are named as either a target for removal or the subject of racist rhetoric . at some point in january 2012 , his first month in office , buttigieg learned that sbpd police had secretly been recorded by the department and that the fbi was investigating for potential violations of federal wiretapping laws . two months later , buttigieg told boykins to resign . after black south bend leaders sided with boykins , boykins rescinded his resignation . on march 30 , in the face of the black community 's outrage , buttigieg instead demoted boykins from his position as chief allegedly for his handling of the recordings . less than two weeks later , april 10 , 2011 , buttigieg fired depaepe , the sbpd director of communications who discovered the calls , reported them to boykins , and then transferred excerpts to five cassette tapes . depaepe went public almost immediately , reportedlysuggesting that the tapes revealed possible police wrongdoing , including racist rhetoric . it was depaepe who first suggested that the tapes for which buttigieg demoted boykins might reveal a plan to accomplish exactly tha"}
