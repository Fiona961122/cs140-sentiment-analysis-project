'' he did this despite being a `` socialist '' and congress being controlled by republicans from 1994 to 2006 , in one of the most partisan right-wing houses ever . passed an amendment to `` require offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white collar crime to give appropriate notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution . '' passed an amendment that improved postsecondary education . it administered a competitive grant program to institutions of higher education seeking to reduce costs through the purchase of goods and services . this saved colleges and taxpayers both money . he expanded free health care and won a $ 100 million increase in funding by using his amendment powers . this added community health centers that gave out a variety of free health care services . prevented child labor by passing an amendment to a general appropriations bill . this stated that the u.s. will not appropriate funds for the importation of goods made by the hands of minors . won a $ 22 million increase for low-income home energy assistance and a related weatherization assistance program . this helped heat homes for the poor . received the distinction of being named the third-most popular senator in the country , according to public policy polling in august 2011 . given a score of 100 percent by the naacp and nhla ( national hispanic leadership agenda ) based on his record during his time in the senate . named one of the top 5 american jews of the forward 50 in 2015 . chairman of the united states senate committee on veterans ' affairs in 2013-2014 . passed an amendment making sure that solar water heaters provide at least 30 percent of hot water for new federal buildings . this is forcing us to use green energy . made sure to it that bailout funds were n't used to replace laid-off u.s. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers . helped ensure that child care was being offered to parents in the armed forces by requiring the comptroller general to provide accurate reporting on what was being done . required a public database be made available showing the names of senior department officials seeking employment with defense contractors . this helped crack down on corruption . required that the tricare program provide treatment to veterans affected by certain types of autism . it was n't previously being done . was praised by john mccain ( r-az ) and sen. jack reed ( d-ri ) for overhauling the veterans administration . was said to have done such an excellent job of bringing all parties to a deal , that it would n't have gotten done without sanders ' work . but , most of all , what bernie has done is inspire americans . that 's what he 's doing in this election . his list of accomplishments does n't include all the times he 's stood on the senate floor giving a passionate speech on why the `` big banks need to be broken up .
