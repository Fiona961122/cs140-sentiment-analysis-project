'' what bernie says looks good on the outside but it will be the downfall of american society if he gets elected . any type of democrat who makes these types of claims will never be elected because the real workers will always elect someone who is pro-business , not pro-morals because morality is highly opinionated meanwhile business is simply survival of the fittest ."}
