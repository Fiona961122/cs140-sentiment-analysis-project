'' instead , bernie was more interested in getting defensive about the obama administration 's record of anemic economic growth . bernie wanted to get the conversation back to what he is most comfortable with , things like the environment , places where bernie knows his talking points . bernie auto assumes that the regulations the business owner is referring to must have something to do with the environment , instead of just taking the time to ask the business owner what the regulations are that he was referring to . why ? because bernie wanted to get the conversation back into his comfort zone instead of finding out what was really going on . bernie then tries to take the conversation into another comfort zone area ... for bernie . an attack on those large corporations . uh.. yeah ... those corporations that employ i do n't even know how many millions of people ( a lot ) . worse , that had absolutely nothing to do with the conversation . the man in that video was a small business owner . bernie did n't want to talk about the regulations on small business owners , he did n't even ask . that was n't bernie 's comfort zone . what are those regulations that were being so hurtful to business and job growth ? we will never know what that business owner was referring to exactly , he never got a chance to say ... bernie wanted to cut him off . bernie never even asked the obvious question ( s ) .  so bernie does not understand economics but it is important to understand why bernie does n't understand economics . bernie has been a poor student his entire life . he was a poor student in college . he is still a poor student . to be a good teacher a person must first be a good student . as we just observed in that video , he does n't listen . all he had to do was ask the obvious question ( s ) , and then just ... listen .  so what does someone do when they do n't understand economics ... they make class warfare speeches about the 1 % . that is all bernie knows how to do . his misunderstanding of economics is so bad that he thinks taxing the upper 1 % more will some how trickle down into everyone else 's bank account . it wo n't . neither will taxing the 1 % more do anything to increase revenue for things like education or infrastructure , or anything else . in fact , we would end up with less tax revenue , not more . there is not one thing in the bernie plan that has anything to do with economic growth ... like what ? nothing in the bernie plan does anything to create job . nor would his plan do anything for education . and here is why ? bernie 's plan results in less economic growth , and therefore ... less money for things like ... education , and infrastructure ( among other things ) . even worse ... here is yet another idea people come up with when it comes from people who do n't understand economics.. like bernie ...  artificially raise the minimum wage to $ 15/hour . `` artificially '' because the bernie way is to simply legislate higher wages into existence . bernie mentioned in the video about corporations moving operations to china ? simply legislating higher wages into existence would only create more disparity between u.s. wages and chinese wages . clearly a bad idea for reasons too obvious to bother explaining . or maybe the reasons are just obvious to everyone except people like bernie ... who does n't understand economics . in any event , real wage growth can only come when it is because of , or the result of ... economic growth . in other words , increased productivity . artificially raising wages , simply legislating it into existence ( without the economic growth that causes wage growth ) , would only result in inflation and /or jobs going somewhere else . to put it another way , ... to think we can increase standards of living by simply legislating higher wages into existence is as silly as thinking we can increase standards of living by doubling money supply . we may as well be wasting our time passing a law banning bad weather on saturdays . artificially trying to create wage growth by simply legislating it into existence does n't do anything for you in real terms , or real standards of living . in fact , it would only have the effect of making it even more difficult for business to compete with.. china .  so why does bernie not understand economics , economic growth , business growth.. real wage growth ? why does bernie not understand a competitive environment ? here is the reason ...  we should never suggest that to understand economics a person must have been a business leader . however , there are two legitimate ways to understand the above things mentioned ( economic growth , etc ) ... 1 ) be directly involved in economic growth .. or 2 ) listen to the people who have been directly involved in economic growth . bernie has never done either of those things . regarding number 1 ( above ) , bernie has never done anything his entire life except be an establishment politician and writing a book ... about being an establishment politician . regarding number 2 ( above ) , bernie does n't listen ... as we saw in that video . he was a poor student in college . fifty-two years later he is still a poor student ... like in the video we just saw ... bad listener .  bernie sanders does n't understand economics and for reasons just explained . his entire life.. he speaks and argues ( as in that video ) when he should be listening . anyone with a reasonable amount of common sense would have recognized an opportunity to listen , take notes , and ask the obvious questions , .. `` what regulations are you referring to ? what can washington do ? in the interest of economic growth , job growth , .. how can we help ? '' in other words , an opportunity to be a good student ( and maybe for the first time in his entire life ) . blown opportunity bernie .  bernie should go back to his ivory tower where he can safely convince himself that he actually knows something ... a place where he can continue being a legend.. in his own mind . bernie 's ivory tower is a place where he can speak and not listen . a place where bernie can try to convince people to covet the 1 % , instead of doing something that really help the `` little guys '' , like focusing on economic growth , increased productivity , so the `` little guys '' can have more for themselves . the politics of coveting , a politics that does absolutely nothing for the `` little guy '' and it never will . economic growth , expanding productivity , real wage growth ... when it is because of economic growth , that is what helps the `` little guy . '' capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any other economic system in the history of the world . stay in your ivory tower where you can forget that you never succeeded at anything your entire life , except being a legend in your own mind . the ivory tower , bernie . we know you must have be happy there .

( we were youngsters , what do ya expect ? lol ) . because a politician wanted his special interests/big business to make more money to avoid unions nafta was forced on us americans . it destroyed the city i grew up in . we literally lost 20 good paying factories , mostly union jobs because of nafta they were allowed to move to mexico . my town is now a dead town with around 17,000 people either to old , ca n't afford , etc to leave . it 's not uncommon for people to be working 2-3 jobs to make it and some still ca n't afford transportation . nuthin but the minimum wage fast food joints that have n't went under left . i agreed with trump that nafta is the `` worst deal ever '' and was happy `` he 's gon na eliminate it '' .. all he did was change the name . so because of politicians we vote in to represent us , mexico 's economy was boosted with 20 manufacturing jobs that do n't require fair pay for employees , ford , gm , etc . who are `` based '' in america are not only profiting because , last i knew , they pay some mexicans employees $ 3 an hour that compared to union wages ( $ 12- $ 20 an hour that they can afford ) that 's a huge profit boost . on top of selling their vehicles to us americans for more than the cost in other countries . like big pharmacies.that politicians have been `` investigating for years '' when it 's obvious they would rather sell a medicine to canada for $ 8 but are charging fellow americans over $ 1000 for the same medicine with the knowledge that americans are dying because who can afford it but the rich . i 'd bet nafta was done by a republican but the fact is that it did n't bother democrats because they 're special interests profited too . politicians are so `` dedicated '' to representing us that they only talk about issues that concern us that they have divided us to where we 're at each other 's throats because of they 're loyalty to special interests that invest in them . but they only care about the pockets of people who have different concerns like trans gender who are considered `` swing voters '' because the swing votes are a major factor in winning . we have republican political party encouraging americans to get violent with other americans because we have no choice but to divide over the issues politicians have split and out of spite for opposing party , will never address if they hold presidency . solely because of political parties those of us who know our planet is in trouble , we `` have '' to vote and hope for a spineless traitor democrat to get elected whose strategy to stop dicktator trump while he sets roots deeper in our democracy everyday is to ask trumps family and administration for a f in intervention and will pray for trump ! ? ! since trump declared another `` state of emergency '' he has the ability to declare martial law and deploy troops . we have to stand together ! stop debating politics , start discussing strategies . set up set up secure ways to communicate ( break out walkie talkies , ham radios ) the government has illegally put out to much information miners . unregulated artificial intelligence with intuitive algorithms is collecting every single piece of our most personal information from all our social sites and our cell phones . the government has illegally been using facial recognition software to track white males , for now . the only way to save our democracy is to vote for direct democracy , our president would be able to address all major issues at the same time while president . we would be the ones voting in laws and voting them out . instead of waiting for politicians to take years accomplishing something we could help the president get the laws he needs to get shet done . we need to make political parties illegal since its conflict of interest to claim they represent us . and try all who did n't uphold their oath as traitors , trump and his administration need tried as terrorist . we have to take away the electoral colleges ability to override our election results . y'all are picking candidates like we have the final say . how tf can trump still be president after it 's proven the election was influenced by russia ! ? ! that should be automatic grounds for revote . if you would be interested in a plan that would eliminate republican and democrat parties and give us a natural non political party of democracy that could work on all the issues in same term , for our democracy in 2020 . hit like . it would be the historical return of our elections back to us since 1890 .

'' '' predictable follow-up question by meghan mccain : `` '' so you 're going to meet with her ? '' '' proposed sanders response : `` '' sure . since you suggested it i 'll do it . '' '' [ everyone laughs ]  what an awful response . while sanders was sitting in the center of a table flanked by four women , two on each side , and as their the guest of honor , he essentially said `` '' no , i 'm not going to meet with the first woman presidential candidate in u.s. history , as well as the one who almost unseated obama in the primary in 2008 , as well as the one who earned nearly three million more votes in the popular 2016 election , as well as the united states ' third woman secretary of state , and the one i told my supporters to vote for . '' '' utterly tone-deaf at any time , to say nothing of in the age of metoo . meghan mccain had checkmated him right there on the show , but sanders either could n't bring himself to admit it or , worse , could n't recognize that it had happened .  so , who was right in 2016 ? the sanders voters who listened to their preferred commander-in-chief and voted for clinton , or the estimated 216,332 sanders voters who ignored his orders and voted for trump in the three key swing states ( wisconsin , pennsylvania , and michigan ) that handed trump the election by a collective margin of just 77,744 votes ? sanders ' messaging is inconsistent .  additionally , there 's bernie sanders again , saying that he `` '' will support [ any democratic ] candidate , because what 's most important is that trump be defeated . '' '' as i 've already said on my facebook wall , the most important thing is not for trump to be defeated ( negative messaging ) ; it is to produce the best democratic candidate possible ( positive messaging ) . that candidate , by definition , will also be a candidate who can defeat trump . as i 've also said on my wall , no democratic front-runner should want bernie sanders ' negative support on that metric at all , because a ) it did n't work for clinton in 2016 and b ) it did n't work for clinton because , when you suggest that someone should vote for a candidate so as to defeat the other , it sends the distinct message that the candidate you are supporting is very , very weak on his or her own merits . and , finally , as i 've also said on my wall , the most important thing is not for trump to be defeated , because theoretically there could be a candidate more dangerous than trump . if the only bar that sanders sets for the democratic party is to produce a candidate who is better than trump , then that 's no bar at all . do you know what can rise when there 's no bar at all ? a dictator . now , i 'm not suggesting that the democratic party could credibly put forth a dictator . but , a republican primary challenge could . bottom line : sanders ' negative messaging is n't just awful , it 's dangerous .  sanders could be kryptonite for a democratic front-runner . i also have strong misgivings regarding the democratic party signalling that it will allow sanders , a lifelong independent , to take up its banner at all , let alone if he becomes the front-runner . any different democratic front-runner who seeks sanders ' primary voters should make clear to sanders that he or she wo n't accept sanders ' negative messaging in the general campaign , period . and , if the democratic party , as a whole , knows what 's good for it , then it will advise the lifelong independent , bernie sanders , to cease that negative messaging immediately .  www facebook/paul.ronco.1 ''", "Ukrainian Bot": "comment time: 2019-03-07T03:54:43.000Z you ca n't be from a jewish background and a lower midclass family at same time .", "Mark Fisher": "comment time: 2019-03-07T02:51:52.000Z `` so socialist do not pay the 90 % tax rate on campaign funds they buy 4 mansions ? and ( cortez ) the hide one million dollars of campaign funds into a `` '' slush fund '' '' ? this is socialist/marxist theft ''", "Why Why Why Why Joe 'Groper' Biden": "comment time: 2019-03-07T01:12:33.000Z `` cnn part of corporate media . israel first is their motto !

today to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign of 1 million active volunteers in every state in our country .   our campaign is not only about defeating donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history . it is not only about winning the democratic nomination in the general election . our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic social racial and environmental justice . our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interest that dominates our economic and political life . i 'm talking about wall street , the health insurance companies , the drug companies , the fossil fuel industry , the military industrial complex , the private prison industry , and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives .   our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism , sexism , homophobia , religious bigotry , and all forms of discrimination . our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country on earth while we end voter suppression , citizens united , and outrageous levels of gerrymandering . our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many , not just a few . we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world . we should not have a grotesque level of wealth inequality in which three billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country . we should not have 30 million americans without any health insurance . even more , who are underinsured , and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline . we should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement . we should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children .   we should not have a regressive tax system in which large profitable corporations like amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes . make no mistake about it . the powerful special interest in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo . they have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties . the only way we will win this election and create a government and an economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement the likes of which has never been seen in american history . they may have the money and the power . we have the people . that is why we need 1 million americans who will commit themselves to this campaign . you know as well as i do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in american history . we are running against a president who is a pathological liar , a fraud , a racist , a sexist , a xenophobe , and someone who is undermining american democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction . i am running for president because now more than ever we need leadership that brings us together , not divides us up . women and men , black white , latino , native american , asian american , gay and straight , young and old , native-born and immigrant , now is the time for us to stand together .   i 'm running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class , not just the 1 % . we need a president that understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs , rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and constructing the affordable housing we desperately need . i am running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multinational corporations . we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage , provide pay equity for women , and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave . i 'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers , not just corporate america and those who own that technology . i 'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has but by how it treats the most vulnerable , the elderly , the children , our veterans , the sick and the poor . i 'm running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science , not politics . we need a president who understands that climate change is real , is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet , and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy . i 'm running for president because the time is long overdue for the united states to join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right , not a privilege , through a medicare for all single-payer program .   i am running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country . i 'm running for president because we need to have the best-educated workforce in the world . it is totally counterproductive for our future that millions of americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt while many others can not afford the high cost of higher education . that is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and lower student debt .   i am running for president because we need real criminal justice reform . we need to invest in jobs and education for our kids not more jails and incarceration . we need to end the destructive war on drugs private prisons in cash bail and bring about major police department reform . i 'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move the comprehensive immigration reform . we need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum . i 'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country . we need to take on the nra expand background checks and the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons . i am running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy , human rights , diplomacy , and world peace .   the united states must leave the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change , militarism , authoritarianism , and global wealth inequality . that is why we need 1 million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish all of these goals . needless to say , there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world now let me give you some very good news that we should all be very proud of three years ago . during our 2016 campaign when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were radical and were extreme . we were told that medicare-for-all , a $ 15 an hour minimum , wage free tuition at public colleges and universities , aggressively combating climate change , demanding that the wealthy stop paying their fair share of taxes , we were told that all of these concepts were ideas that the american people would never accept . well , three years have come and gone and as a result of millions of americans standing up and fighting back , all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of americans . together you and i and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution now it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for .   so here is my question for you , will you stand with me as part of a million-person grassroots movement which can not only win the democratic nomination , not only win the general election , but most importantly help transform this country , so that finally we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few . together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic racial , social , and environmental justice , and together we can defeat donald trump and repair the damage he has done to our country . brothers and sisters , if we stand together there is no limit to what we can accomplish . i hope you 'll join me . thank you very much ''", "2019-02-21T08:01:43.000Z": "comment time:  lays out agenda and values in 11-minute video\" mathew hastings `` so his ideas are the same as 2016 free this and free that

'' he added that surge in illegal immigration should be combatted with multiple reforms , including mandatory e-verify , which would bar employers from hiring illegal aliens for u.s. jobs . but democrats deflect by calling trump a racist which as we all know is a classic democrat talking point that is strangely effective with low information voters on the left .     we always hear about putting americans first now that trump is in charge . let 's hope that happens here . it seems unlikely that a daca deal is n't made but what 's in the deal will be critically important and americans need to understand there are important financial ramifications here .

( state insurance commissioners are almost always corrupt and can usually be called polistitutes , because they will do whatever the billionaires and millionaires who are the owners of insurers or hmos or ama want , so long as those persons later fund their future political campaigns . we need an independent ministry of justice dedicated to investigating and imprisoning corrupt politicians , such as most insurance commissioners . )  just having the us government ( medicare for all ) make contracts for drugs at fixed prices would enable it to use its tremendous bargaining power to drastically lower pharmaceutical costs . since so many of the technological and pharmaceutical developments are funded by or result from research funded by us tax payers , we can impose requirements that drug makers charge the us lower prices : the wealthy who own drug makers now profit from us funding for research , without even reimbursing us tax payers for one penny of their funding .

'' '' so buttigieg 's supporters are fine with whoever in the general , even republican-lite , but not everyone has the `` '' vote blue no matter who '' '' mentality , and i 'm seeing plenty of people saying they wo n't vote or wo n't vote dem if the dems nominate a corporatist . so we will end up with trump again if we do n't have a good nominee . we ca n't lie down and let that happen . yet buttigieg will peal away votes from more qualified candidates , making for a chaotic angst filled convention .  the reasons i keep seeing people state for supporting buttigieg are incredibly superficial : he 's cute ( some people found the trojan horse attractive and think how that worked out ) , he 's young ( with age also comes useful experience ... besides there 's other more qualified people his age who could or have run ) , buttigieg wrote a book ( so did most of the candidates running , and candidates typically do n't write something that makes them look bad ... well , with the exception of hickenlooper and that movie he took his mom to ) , buttigieg plays the piano ( billy joel is the `` '' piano man '' '' but nobody thinks he should be president ) , buttigieg talks nice ( being a smooth-talker and using the vernacular of progressives is not a substitute for good policies ) , he 's gay ( so that checks that identity politics box , while he wavers on supporting lgbtq , and again there 's more qualified lgbtq politicians who could run ) , and he speaks multiple languages ( that 's another 'fun fact ' like the playing piano , buttigieg would make a great translator , but he 's applying for a different job . besides , speaking multiple languages is only swoon-worthy in this county . in european countries and other parts of the world , it 's an average tuesday . my swiss grandfather could speak 7 languages , but even if he had been born here , speaking multiple languages would not have made him automatically qualified to be president . ) all this buttigieg trivia tells voters nothing about what he will do for people or this country or the world since the president is one of the world leaders .  he is mayor of a city which is 301st in population size of the cities in the us . most of his city 's voters are republicans so buttigieg being liked by republicans is n't a selling point when he has conservative leanings . dems and a lot of independents have very different priorities than a lot of republicans . this is democratic primary . the city he 's mayor of has significant problems , which i 'll get back to . buttigieg says the left and center-left talk about policies too much and that we should talk more about philosophy and our values and religion would fall into that , and he 'll get to policy specifics later ( aka the beto approach ) . the long standing complaint by voters is politicians spouting too many platitudes and not talking about policy specifics to help people . a large portion of this country ca n't afford a $ 500 emergency , and still a significant portion of this country ca n't afford a $ 100 emergency , so people in need are n't *that* interested in a candidate 's philosophical or religious views . ironically , the media is trying to sell buttigieg to progressives/berners by reporting that in high school he wrote an essay praising bernie sanders . i read that essay , and it praised the fact that bernie stands up boldly for what 's right even when it 's not popular or is mocked ( like standing up for african americans starting in the 1960s and even being only one of two white leaders supporting jesse jackson in his presidential in the 1980s or speaking out in favor of lgbtq rights in the 1970s , as well as authorizing gay pride day and fighting housing decriminalization for lgbtq as mayor in the 1980s and fighting the anti-gay marriage bill doma in congress in the 1990s , yet 30-something buttigieg does not make bold stands for what 's right , instead spouting vague platitudes , not being 'all in ' on healthcare , he 's pro-aipac , and went against the will of indiana voters to use his super delegate status to votes for hillary , even though indiana went to bernie in 2016 . on cnn buttigieg went on a tangent about needing to refocus the discussion on the `` '' religious left . '' '' putting aside the importance of separation of church and state , he 's not for medicare for all and takes the name of this hugely popular policy and bastardizes it into 'medicare for all who want it public option buy in , ' so how does letting people die because they ca n't afford to buy in fit with his christian beliefs ? he is against free college , like klobuchar , yang , etc . he 's open to taking corporate money and is having a swanky broadway fundraiser where the wealthy and bundlers will likely attend ( similar to the swanky hollywood fundraiser jj abrams had for kamala harris ) . buttigieg calls boycotting ( like with a homophobic restaurant ) `` '' virtual signaling , '' '' and such `` '' political '' '' things should be left up to the government , so for the people who support him because he represents the lgbtq community because he 's gay , he is also dismissing the voices of lgbtq people and their allies for exercising their right to not spend their money at a restaurant chain that known to be bigoted towards the lgbtq community . he does n't want to protect whistleblowers . public safety depends on businesses and government being held accountable , and whistleblowers are vital to that . the city of 102,000 that he 's run since 2011 has a bad poverty rate , racial income disparities and a high crime rate . he sells himself via the talking point that running a city is like running a small country , but the us already has enough problems and an inexperienced president , so we do n't need mayor pete buttigieg to do to the us what he did to south bend , indiana . there 's just too much work to be done , and our lives and our children 's lives literally depend on getting the next election right .

'' ''  one of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps , and it was all downhill from there .  sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor , and she soon left him . penniless , he went on unemployment . then he had a child out of wedlock . desperate , he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail . `` `` he was a shi**y carpenter , '' '' a friend told politico magazine . `` `` his carpentry was not going to support him , and did n't . '' '' notable quote : `` '' let 's send sanders to moscow it 's where he spent his honeymoon `` '' -- 'lisa '  then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags , writing about `` '' masturbation and rape '' '' and other crudities for $ 50 a story . he drove around in a rusted-out , bondo-covered vw bug with no working windshield wipers . friends said he was `` '' always poor '' '' and his `` '' electricity was turned off a lot . '' '' they described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment and this is what his friends had to say about him .  the only thing bernie sanders was good at was talking non-stop about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off . `` `` the whole quality of life in america is based on greed , '' '' the bitter lay about said . `` `` i believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation . '' '' misrepresentations and distortions of others is his specialty skill set  so he tried politics , starting his own socialist party . four times he ran for vermont public office , and four times he lost badly . he never attracted more than single-digit support even in the people 's republic of vermont . in his 1971 bid for u.s. senate , the local press said the 30-year-old `` '' sanders describes himself as a carpenter who has worked with disturbed children . ' `` `` in other words , a real winner .  he finally wormed his way into the senate in 2006 , where he still ranks as one of the poorest members of congress . save for a municipal pension , sanders lists no assets in his name . all the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife 's . he does , however , have as much as $ 65,000 in credit-card debt .  sure , sanders may not be a hypocrite , but this is nothing to brag about . his worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other `` '' outsiders '' '' in the race for the white house , including a billionaire developer , a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a fortune 500 ceo .  lets see ... bernie spouts off that his dad migrated from poland to america so he could live the american dream ... then bernie dedicates his life to turning america into poland . bernie calls himself a washington outsider , when the only job he has ever had is as an elected official . bernie wants to show empathy for the working man , when he has never ever been a working man . bernie wants to talk about democracy , and then hires others to blockade the rallies of his opponent ... the true act of a socialist ( meaning the people should not tolerate the candidate i do n't like ) . and now bernie is a new yorker . hmmm ... .  in summary : bernie sanders is nothing but a bs 74 years old socialist , borderline communist 'conscientious objector pacifist ' ( a.k.a . coward ) no senate bills in 30 years being a senator ? ? free this and free that with no coherent plan to pay for his freebie cons . personal attacks showing first stages of dementia ( old age ) bernie supporters are looking for a bailout of their student loans ... that 's the only reason he has support ... even if elected , he could n't get the legislation through ... but kids will be kids ... .  in a leaked audio , crooked hillary mocked the millions of americans who proudly voted for bernie sanders , calling them basement-dwellers and hopeless .    this comes just weeks after hillary told donors at a closed-door fundraiser that tens of millions of patriotic men and women are deplorable , irredeemable , and un-american .  it is pretty simple principal . the united states has been so prosperous because government has largely stayed out of business and allowed free markets to flourish . other countries which have more government control have fewer investors , little entrepreneurship , and less prosperity .    the degree to which government stays out of business interests is directly proportional to the prosperity of it 's citizens . venezuela today is the poster child of bernie sanders & alex cortez and the bolshevik 's 'democratic socialism ' .  bernie sanders still considers maduro to be the rightful leader of venezuela . he wo n't call him a dictator and wo n't refer to guaido as the president of venezuela . what does that say for what he wants to transform america into ?

'' ''  remember the speech sen. sanders gave four years ago at liberty university ? would n't you say it was pretty bold of him to do so ? he faced all those people . right around 5 : 30 into the speech he quotes matthew 7 : 12 , therefore , whatever you want men to do to you , do also to them , for this is the law and the prophets . is not sen. sanders showing this without being `` '' religious ?

 these globally are the only machines ready for assembly-line , high-volume design and production i found in trade studies , you try .  they are a bleeding edge , beaten path to a near zero-emission , tiny carbon-footprint motive power for all machines .  second , is using algae to purify wastewater at the treatment plant , or onsite for homefarmranch using the same units , this emits o2 and removes co2 , eh ?  then , the oils & biomass can become biodiesel and derivatives , from a pilot study i did for phoenix , az , a 10m-gallon/day plant can produce about 3m-gallon/day of biodiesel , gov . jan brewer and her epa head were on board , we got shot down by her party , the gop in the usa .  too bad , eh ? sound familiar ?  third : have all ic-engine mfg 's make replacements with n.tesla tailpipes , a one-way air valve with no moving parts that nearly zeroes emissions for their tailpipes .  if they wo n't , shut them down , this eliminates soot from biodiesel , can be scaled up to industrial smokestacks , it reduces back-pressure , improves performance .  and , he tied it to ic-engines for this purpose 80yrs ago , eh ?  fourth : it all boils down to dealing with arctic seaice , heat gained in the 2007 retreat was 95,000-twh over average .  closing all steam-age power plants 250mwh and above is a one-time save of 36,000-twh in emitted wasteheat .  that 's 21/2-times too little to balance the gain vs the loss compared to the 1980-2000 average ice extent .  losing the seaice is game-over on controlling runaway in the arctic , this is what brings the extremes in weather vs assuming it 'd get tropical to midwest farmers , eh ?  also , the arctic ocean is at the aragonite saturation point , all that a local marine biologist saw flying over the newly opened water were jellyfish , millions of them .  there is no fishery there as it becomes open water .  the serious 'last hurrah ' for it all , to me , for what humanity needs to do :  install a weir dam at st. lawrence is . and polder north the entire chukchi sea to prevent wave damage and stratify the water to refreeze the bottom creating a year-round seaice refuge .  all shipping confined within 3-4km of shore , zero cross-ocean traffic , this uses dutch ships , materials and methods to create polders , shoals & levees .  and , building submerged `` '' atolls '' '' encircling methane vents , this uses the bubble flow to pull in colder bottom water which refreezes them .  it all confines the freshwater runoff and most of all limits early melting from shore out to-sea in spring .  this reduces 5-amazons of warmer , fresher water to 1/100th of what is melting the seaice from below .  fresher water freezes at a higher temperature so true seaice is n't formed at the surface on freezeup , it needs -2c/28.4f for seaice to last over one season .  this intends to prevent the siberian jetstream from turning north and can be modelled , the n.pacific is too warm and heats the airmass from below , with the blob in the gulf of ak , that drives the circulation pattern needing change back to holocene patterns .  so , the warmth sends rain to anchorage in december and frozen oranges to florida the routine now , started early , eh ?  as that air cools it now gets to low latitudes only over land to balance equatorial overheating .  the concept has 36,000 views on a seaice forum and zero actions upon it .  it 's the only geographic location on earth with the ability to alter the anthropocene jetstream paths back into n.america instead of going north .  i ca n't order it done , the people in the poop deck party think everything 's fine with lifeboats already in the water ...  in any case , it 's the only sane try to alter things not dependent upon emissions to overcome those effects enough to give midwest farmers a break , else , expect a repeat of this past year or worse , eh ?  expect flooding after this early snow , cold ground for maximum runoff vs a normal holocene year , or worse , it stays cold .  welcome to the anthropocene , co2 wo n't go below 400ppm for > > 120,000-years as oceans outgas their aragonite losses by reversing the carbonic acid cycle which acidifies fast and goes alkaline very , very slowly , a biogeochemical hysteresis , a real reason to consider extinction with business-as-usual .  `` `` the rate of acidification is 10-times faster or more than anything we have seen for the past 50-million years and perhaps over the last 300-million years.

( both were planning their runs ) .  as a side note : sanders encouraged warren to run in 2015 , then she had the higher national name recognition and there was a draft movement : run liz , run . but warren declined ( i am sure she did not want to alienate the party / clinton machine . she was content to angle for a vp or cabinet position ) .  so sanders stepped up ( coordinating with warren cost him some valuable time ! he announced at the end of april 2015 ) . sanders and jeff weaver planned a grassroots campaign with 30 million dollars , no one - including them - thought that they had a shot at winning . ( never mind their assertions , of course they did not openly state that ) . sanders wanted to use the platform to draw attention to important issues ( single payer healthcare , student loan debt , minimum wage , regulation the too big to fail banks ) and he wanted to set an example that it is possible to run a robust campaign w/o big corporate donations .  warren could be president now ! if she had adopted an unwavering ! pro single payer stance ! - i think sanders would have enthusiastically campaigned for her already in the primaries . he would have endorse her right away ( damned be the party machine ) . together they could really have chased hrc - and trump in the ge . i do not even think that sanders would have demanded a cabinet position in exchange for his endorsement and support . outreach / coordinator for single payer maybe - but he adopted that role on his own while remaining senator for vt after the nov. 2016 election .  back to the `` '' debate '' '' of jan. 2020 : senator did you say to elizabeth warren that a woman can not win the presidency ? sanders : no ! ( makes his arguments : i asked warren to run in 2015 and would have defered to her . hrc won the propular vote by 3 million how could anyone believe a woman can not win ... . ) interviewer : just to wrap this up : you never said to e.w . that a woman can not win the presidency ? sanders : no .  interviewer turns to elizabeth warren : senator warren how did you feel when senator sanders said to you that a woman can not win the presidency ?  some in the audience burst into a surprised laugh . it was ridiculuos ( senator sanders : when did you stop beating your wife ? ) .  questions worthy of a _journalist : _ we have two very different accounts what was said in that meeting . sen. warren , can you give us more details , or is it possible that there has been a misunderstanding ... .  sanders stated that he commented on trump in that meeting with warren in dec. 2018 . that he is a racist , sexist , bigot ... who will exploit everything - incl . gender - to go after the democratic nominee - so it is possible that he said something w/o bad intentions that warren perceived as offensive or condescending . ( cenk has `` '' sources '' '' that cnn has been working for months on a narrative angle to smear sanders being a `` '' sexist '' '' - and now that he took the lead in some iowa polls it was time to unleash the campaign ) .  sanders is right that trump will play dirty - and warren happens to be ill equipped to stand up to such attacks in my opinion . has nothing to do with professional qualification . which are not enough to win the presidency .  she would need to have a spine ( oops ! ) and not be wobbly about key issues . and she would need to know when to react and which battles not fo fight . warren let herself be baited by trump into the dna video regarding her native ancestry .  not a big deal ( it is not going to break her candidacy ) but it reveals some flaws that do make her a bad fit to go against trump .  who thought it was a good idea to publish dna results when they show that she has less matching dna than the average american ? not only was that foolish and also showed poor political instincts ( being triggered by trump 's `` '' pocahontas '' '' attacks - if that is the worst the right wingers can find out about her , she is fine , no need to lean into their narrative . chose your battles and chose the location of your battles . trump would love to engage her in the silly `` '' pocahontas '' '' controversy - but who says she has to play along with it ? ) .  she also offended the first nations while she was at it . ancestry as they define it is not proven by dna testing - and she could not be bothered to consult with them before she published the dna video .  never mind that she declared herself to be native american back in the day w/o any connection to the first nations and w/o doing any research ( other than a vague family story , which might be easily fiction . it seems many families have such a romanticized tale - and more often than not it is not true if they do the research ) .  well back in the day people were less sensitive about cultural appropriation - but she has n't evolved on the issue . native american councils called her out when the dna video was published ( politely , but they made clear that it was offensive ) . i think she did not profit personally from identifying as native american , but that it was a little vain - and in harvard likely doing her employer favors ( they had a token minority among staff , which actually was from white middle class background . her family was solidly middle class before her father got sick ) .  if my assumption is correct - it is not the worst thing ever , but it means that a genuine minority applicant might have missed out on a chance to be employed by harvard . warren likely helped them sugarcoat their diversity record .  several tribes organized the resistance against dapl - warren did not support the water protectors . at that time ( summer / fall 2016 ) it seemed likely that hrc would win the presidency and warren was still angling for a cabinet position . so damned be considerations of pipelines for exporting ! crude oil that will eventually leak and jeopardize the water source for millions ( the missouri ) . the party / the clinton machine would not have liked warren to alienate the donors of big finance and the fossil fuel industry .  methinks warren just is n't progressive presidential material . able and willing to bring about `` '' big structural change '' '' . and the last controversy she started about the `` '' sexism '' '' of sanders makes her look not only weak in certain aspects but outright calculating , ruthless , and disingenuous . plus being under the influence of clueless advisors ( allegedly she has a lot of former clinton / obma staffers ) .  with that dna video she proved that she still did n't get it . in this day and age you do not call yourself a native american ( or justify that you self-identified as such in the past ) if you have never lived in the communities , lived the culture , and without native relatives or documented ancestry .  dna does not make the native american ** - it is a cultural / spiritual / societal connection ( sanders and gabbard never claimed ancestry - but they came out in support of the water protectors nontheless ) .  ** the tribes occasionally accepted white people , black slaves , pepole from latin america and other foreigners into their communities . ( there are cases where they kidnapped children of settlers , to raise them as their own ) .  to make things worse , a few months ago she gave an interview to charlemagne the god ( black radio ) . she did not expect detailled questions on policy or any hard hitting questions . it was a lifestyle interview if you will . he asked her when have you realized that you do not have native ancestors ?  she started a word salad ( not answering his question , but tap dancing around the issue . `` `` look , ... . '' '' ) . in other words : she knows that trump will bring this up if she becomes the nominee , but for now she very carefully controls which interviews she gives - only in `` '' friendly territory '' '' ( she also does not go on fox news ) . so she still did not have her soundbites ready - likely she did not expect to be asked such invconvenient questions during the primary season .  the interviewer had mercy and did not press her anymore ( or point out that she was deflecting and had not answered his question ) . even w/o the recent disingenuous action ( sanders told me i can not become president - i am almost certain he did not say it in _that_ manner , nor did he mean it _that_ way ) - trump would run circles around her , she does not have the flexibility to react to questions she perceives as `` '' challenging '' '' .  she took offense when amy goodman asked her a legitimate question , a snappy short exchange followed ( goodman remained polite ) and then warren left the stage , she shook the hand of the other person on the stage , but refused to shake the hand of amy goodman when she wanted to thank her for the interview .  if she can not even deal with amy goodman ( who is progressive , polite , factual , nuanced and does not do gotcha journalism ) - good luck in the ge with the rightwingers .

 as to a peacemaker view is to all human ideals held to a good esteem of actions in a political warfare where understanding your opponents ensures you are more likely to defeat them seeing them as good men that are lawful and moved by the belief of what best serves the nation being acted out where each holding the same profound belief held to each a set of ideals .  the respect you have for your opponent 's opinion proves you could at least see the truth , as any peacemakers sees that at least a leader of a nation must understand any duration of lasting time has contrasting moments that each thrust one property of a party 's ideal above the other and these by times cycle trusting again one over the other .  for whosoever transcends his own ideals also loves the ideals of the opposing party loving such men as full of goodness and does hold all parties as one party through the times echoing the realities that trust the path of the most ideal president who simply obeys what ideal fated to be in best service of nation for the time for that ideal is nigh .  what ideals each soul holds in good esteem may differ endless and each set of ideals creating differing men in their ways yet are all good as the diversity makes a stronger profession of ways even as the way of a nation that is best is also matter only time can tell as who declared his own ideal as the only way of a nation has not honored the nation and it 's people but who puts aside his own ideals that leads his way to ensure whatever time fated the ideals best for the nation at the present time are also the way the nation shall go as this may not honor your own way , as your way can not always honor the nation , but the way that best honors the nation the most , however long your way must also be the way of the nation and the same to your ideals must be the same for your nation so do you prove your conceit both divides the nation as thought the devil to divide and conquer as only those conceited could do a work of the devil so unaware lead to the devil 's deed beset in confusion conceit provides and so the senses no more see and so unawares so beset in the conceit already made comfortable to the mind as the habit of what is thought good as held to ideals to one way of politics and so one party 's confusion set as dictator of your own ideal in office opposed to what greatest good comes from ideals differing from decade to decade as such variety of many different ways provide a pool of possibilities each needed when the time for election occurs so does the time elects the best ideals as the way that shall honor the nation to the greatest .  who must trust in only his own ideal as best this is the conceit that will one day with the conceit of all men damn us all to separation and then the confusion that shall call our brothers enemies and then for this we will hate them also .  we do know the truth we would have loved our brothers had we known them , as if we truly knew our fellow men then we would know one of our brothers ways are fated to be the greatest good for the nation 's time and with the times each time brings the change to which what was thought the opposing party and its ideals are more ideal during one time over another and even more so with greater diversity so a finer spectrum has even a more narrow set of ideals more befitting the hour of nation as to ensure one out of many in diversity is the present greatest good to the hour of that nation 's elected way .  leaders who forsake there own conceit and forfeit their own good view as universal to all , but only to themselves knowing the way of a nation changes with the time as what best serves a nations path changes with the time . wherewith , a large pool is a better diversity of ideals where more refined possibility exist to best bring forth highest good .  for every possibility of the nation 's times knowing the time tells the future as well as god , so can we then predict who is the fairest of them all , simply that one of our brother 's ways who we love carries the ideals befitting to this present time and so this diversity exists so no matter the time , the best ideal will be shown it self before the honest men who forsook their own conceit they were the best as the modest knew themselves well enough to know any good man and the time will speak to these modest men who know the great virtue is carried though time to a varaible difference requiring diversity to ensure what ideal for the time of the nation is available to rule always to the best interests of the nation realized least our own conceit rub us of our foresight .  knowing i told you the truth only requires faith even before so much conceit . do not let your conceit deny a peacemakers way , i have no conquest , as i only conquered myself .

with each other . three steps . 1 . viable incomes for the severely disabled , the world 's first , last , and only real helpless slaves . slaves are the base of any pyramid . disabled guinea pigs are the bottom . we are enslaved as the primary working functional assests of the world 's immune system to all manner of disease amongst other functions we can not even begin to share because of oppression . i 'm talking about the chronically , severely ill people who should not be working , many of whom do , forced to sacrifice any level of stability in their existence . expounding my support for you is key to fully understanding and not underestimating my objectives . i am for the health of all people . this section should help : achieving the political center and implications for the disabled some say the political center is the best place from which to run a campaign . it could just be the best way to manage the world . it 's the only way to stay healthy . to achieve the center , you have to know where it is first . the politicians would have us believe the fence-post riders are the center . that sounds painful . life has enough pain without creating more . that 's good . i 'll have to say that to uncle jed the next visit . let 's look at the center in science . in physics the center of gravity is a point from which the weight of a body or system may be considered to act . most of my neighbors , uncle jed and family think it 's the vagina on women . in uniform gravity it is the same as the center of mass ( google , excluding the joke ) . in chemistry science , a homogenous , ( pronounced ho-modge-e-nus ) , from google , is a type of mixture that is very stable , i.e. , its particles do not settle , or separate . this is what all people do . bullies rip us away from the main stream via torture . as a homogeneous mixture , a solution has one phase ( liquid ) although the solute and solvent can vary : for example , salt water . the key word here is stable . in life all things are analogous to something else and i believe this is analogous to society from and including a political science perspective . homogenuity is essential or we exitessentially . in each science 's version of center , the conditions described are those which are inherent of the political center . in chemistry , when creating a solution , it must be stirred to reach it 's stable condition called homogenous . that often includes heat and other factors as well but we do n't have to go that far as of yet . in society to reach this level one must be free to move around to find an area of the solution best suited to what one has to offer to contribute to society and the bottom line , i might add , so that one is stabilizing society as opposed to creating a larger burden and the consequential chaos that almost always happens . i had to disengage from family and work just to digest . by the same token the solution needs boundaries . right now that should remain countries and immigration should pretty much be halted . if they do n't they 'll never improvise their own resources . i 'm sure the geniuses can extrapolate an exact percentage of the necessary portion of the population needed for that stability to allow us to reach the thriving point . since freedom is necessary for this , one should assume that at least some particular level of liberal approach to politics is necessary to achieve the center notwithstanding , however , our conservative restrictions to ensure one moves without harming others or national security . that 's the big difference between us and a molecule of sugar . it does n't need laws . neither do animals , ultimately . the center of gravity is already implicit in the chemistry science because your strengths are only potential if you do not have the freedom to move around and wield them because it renders your center of gravity useless . remember that the center of gravity is the point from which you act . if you are not acting or forced to act at something that is not your strength your center of gravity is moot . that 's what happens to most severely disabled people . what everybody sees is not your center no matter what the politicians call it . keep in mind that people that develop strengths naturally in response to their environmental conditions are responding to deficits already in society . that 's why many of us , though we have learning disabilities , are forced to look stupid because we are n't even given the opportunity to wield from our own centers to develop those strengths . we could play a much larger role in the world 's immune system from this perspective throughout all the sciences . that might explain why i 'm not even a number yet . if we had opportunity in proportion to what healthy people are afforded to exhibit our knowledge through our strengths , our true genius would be revealed . i think society fears this because they still think we are monsters , like nobody wants a monster with power , huh ? it 's a double standard . that makes it unconstitutional because double standards of this magnitude prevent us from achieving life , liberty and happiness . i feel the immigration has to be stopped . take the middle east . their own people need to put pressure on them to start making their own food and water with the trillions they make from oil . just as pertinent , there are just to many people to encourage success by moving to the u.s . they should be having less children as a way to stand up and say , `` '' well , we are not going to provide another slave until we are paid viable incomes . '' '' i did and i would do it again despite not being paid . i would rather be dead than even go back to trying to socialize with family who will not even account for my disability . democrats provide republicans with slaves . it 's atrocious . i will not come back to the democratic party and i will reman in my new party of `` '' not affiliated '' '' until there are gigantic changes including a viable income . i was and have always been a democrat in spirit .  on another note and addressing the horrors of slavery . ( from my message to bernie sanders ) i watched your message at https : //www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/bernie-sanders-lets-not-make-people-overly-nervous-about-socialism.html but you say nothing of the congenitally afflicted severely disabled people who work by conscription every day of their life without pay . you boast about fdr 's message . he was for the disabled but nobody has yet seen the light that we deserve a viable dole from social security or another program . we are your time machines . we are men and women existing in a nightmare , bullied , used , abused , and forgotten and some of us wishing we were forgotten because of the horribleness of being bullied every minute of every day . you mentioned that people are not rising up , that it takes millions . these millions have been suckling on my amaciated breast since i can remember . by surrogate mother 's rights i am speaking for them with their blessings because they know they are too neanderthal to do the right thing . they agreed with me just this morning as i was doing dishes . people are not rising up because politicians do n't do enough . you should have to prove yourself before you are elected and then improve upon the improvements and make sure they stick after being elected . when you lift a dysfunctional pal of water , you should always lift from the bottom . disabled guinea pigs are the bottom . we are a working functional part of the world 's immune system to all manner of disease yet we receive no viable compensation . that is where you should begin . we are the original and perpetual slaves of this country and nobody has ever viably helped us . people thought black people 's prosperity would bring the country down . the top half would n't be where it is without their investments . now , it 's time for the disabled . this is the story of my nightmare of an existence . imagine uncle sam lifting a dysfunctional pal of water with all the disabled slaves falling out the bottom in the company of or falling into the laps of addicts , rapists , murderers and other thieves all exposed with their die schwanze hanging out . we need viable incomes . when i asked invisible man , president jimmy carter for assistance with getting food out of my parents back in the 70s , all he did was laugh at me . ______________________________________________________________________________________ 2 . lower the population . the population is too big . politicians and corporations need to find a way to increase their bottom line based on the health of their two biggest resources , people and the environment . the disabled are footing the bill and bearing the brunt of all the world 's aggression .   ________________________________________________________________________________________ 3 . build forests in the u.s. - we do n't have are to breath or wather to drink . i am sick every day from the pollution . we have a better chance of making the ohio valley the next oxygen producing rain forest than throwing money at people who do n't care about civil rights . the money is bond to fund cheap drugs to distribute in the u.s. so all those poor drug dealers can join the 50 % of the country that did so well the past 20 years and want to help their recreational team while the disabled foot the bill .

''   2 . the critical thinker scrutinizes the evidence before drawing conclusions .  critical thinkers strive to weigh all the available evidence before arriving at conclusions . and , in evaluating evidence , critical thinkers distinguish between empirical evidence versus opinions based on feelings or personal experience .  3 . the critical thinker can assume other perspectives .  critical thinkers are not imprisoned by their own points of view . nor are they limited in their capacity to imagine life experiences and perspectives that are fundamentally difference from their own . rather , the critical thinker strives to understand and evaluate issues from many different angles .  4 . the critical thinker is aware of biases and assumptions .  in evaluating evidence and ideas , critical thinkers strive to identify the biases and assumptions that are inherent in any argument ( riggio & halpern , 2006 ) . critical thinkers also try to identify and minimize the influence of their own biases .  5 . the critical thinker engages in reflective thinking .  critical thinkers avoid knee-jerk responses . instead , critical thinkers are reflective . most complex issues are unlikely to have a simple solution . therefore , critical thinkers resist the temptation to sidestep complexity by boiling an issue down to an either/or , yes/no kind of proposition . instead , the critical thinker expects and accepts complexity ( halpern , 2007 ) .  critical thinking is not a single skill , but rather a set of attitudes and thinking skills . as is true with any set of skills , you can get better at these skills with practice .  in a nut shell , critical thinking is the active process of minimizing preconceptions and biases while evaluating evidence , determining the conclusions that can be reasonably be drawn from evidence , and considering alternative explanations for research findings or other phenomena .  critical thinking questions > why might other people want to discourage you from critical thinking ?  > in what situations is it probably most difficult or challenging for you to exercise critical thinking skills ? why ?  > what can you do or say to encourage others to use critical thinking in evaluating questionable claims or assertions ?
