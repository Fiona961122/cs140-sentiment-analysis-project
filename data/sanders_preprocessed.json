I'm just eight years younger than Bernie Baby and therefore a member of the Baby Boomer generation born just four years after the end of World War II. I grew up on a tobacco and cotton farm with poor parents who idolized Franklin Delano Roosevelt who is a godlike figure among Democrats  a patrician who belied the real attitude of his fellow patricians and had empathy for the ordinary working class citizens of his day.  A shallow man in many ways whose opinion about the vast majority his fellow citizens beneath him in the financial class was perhaps altered dramatically when he saw that his own life could be altered forever and had he not been a rich man who could financially cope much better with the affliction of Infantile Paralysis (Polio) his life would no doubt be tortured by such an illness until you would thankfully die before becoming a very old person with such a terrible disease.        I think that was the one thing in his life that made FDR the great man that he was whereas Bernie Sanders learned it through his keen observation growing up in a lower middle income family the son of a Polish immigrant paint salesman and a loving mother who longed for the American dream of owning her own home.  This man is an inspiration for me and I only wish I had had the same ideological passion he has always possessed and had had the wherewithal and determination to act upon it like he has.  I consider him the FDR of our time and would walk over burning coals and broken glass to vote for him.  He is the only man who can save this nation from predatory capitalism and ultimate trampling of our democratic republic at the hands of the oligarchy and treasonous Republican Party.  If he does it and accomplishes turning this great nation he will not have made America Great Again as the MAGA fools hats suppose, but he will have finally \"\"Make America Great\"\".  I love this country, and would give my life for it, but I'm sick of the lies and the pretense.  Horatio Alger stories about becoming a success and financially stable is and has always been American fiction, a myth about extraordinary people who succeeded despite the obstacles.        That is no easy task for the average person.  Most of those stories are about the rare genius or artist, which we all know is beyond the majority of most people.  It doesn't make them better in any manifest way, but simply the result of winning a genetic lottery like being born the child of a rich person.  You can get rich through your talent or be the dullest human on the planet and be born to fabulous weath.  Our current president, and for Christ's sake George W. Bush are both wholly lacking in mental acumen, Trump even worse lacking in any moral compass and they have had lives of express luxury and should never risen to the most powerful political office in the world.

", "Bobby Vaught": "\"Let's take a close look at Bernie Sanders  and why he won't win. He may get the Democrat nomination  2020..  perhaps. He won't win in November 2020. Watch the video first  then come back to this post and we can and review.  We will know exactly where Bernie is missing it... and why he won't win.  First  the video  then comments to follow.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-qgjLMXc0k&t=99s    Okay, you watched the video. Let's talk about what we just saw. That video was posted in January 2017, by someone else, not me. It was clearly something that took place prior to the election 2016, probably during the primaries.  A small business owner was making the point to Bernie that regulations and taxes were killing the small business owner. Bernie immediately starts ARGUING with the man, as though Bernie would understand what is going on in the man's business better than that business owner knows himself? Really? Before continuing our analysis of that video, back to that in a minute... let's get a little background on Bernie so we can understand WHY he makes these kinds of mistakes...    Bernie graduated from Harvard with a degree in Political Science in 1964. He had below average grades. He later explained that by saying he was bored with school. So, he was \u201cbored\u201d with the major that HE picked. Got it. He then proceeded to get involved in politics. Bernie has succeeded at just two things his entire life... 1. being an establishment politician and 2. writing a book about being an establishment politician. That's pretty much it. He has spent his whole life thinking he has everything figured out for everyone else. He hasn't figured anything out...  but he THINKS he has.  Back to the video...     It never even dawns on Bernie to ask that business owner the obvious question(s). Like... \u201cwhat regulations are you referring to? How can Washington help you succeed? How can we help?\u201d Instead, Bernie was more interested in getting defensive about the Obama administration's record of anemic economic growth.  Bernie wanted to get the conversation back to what he is most comfortable with, things like the environment, places where Bernie knows his talking points. Bernie auto ASSUMES that the regulations the business owner is referring to must have something to do with the environment, instead of just taking the time to ask the business owner what the regulations are that he was referring to. Why? Because Bernie wanted to get the conversation back into his comfort zone instead of finding out what was really going on. Bernie then tries to take the conversation into another comfort zone area... for BERNIE. An attack on those large corporations. Uh.. yeah... those corporations that employ \u2026 I don't even know how many millions of people (a lot). Worse, that had absolutely nothing to do with the conversation. The man in that video was a SMALL business owner. Bernie didn't want to talk about the regulations on small business owners, he didn't even ask. That wasn't Bernie's comfort zone. What are those regulations that were being so hurtful to business and job growth? We will never know what THAT business owner was referring to exactly, he never got a chance to say... Bernie wanted to cut him off. Bernie never even asked the obvious question(s).     So Bernie does not understand economics but it is important to understand WHY Bernie doesn't understand economics. Bernie has been a poor student his entire life. He was a poor student in college. He is still a poor student. To be a good teacher a person must first be a good student. As we just observed in that video, he doesn't \u2026 LISTEN. All he had to do was ask the obvious question(s), and then just...  listen.    So what does someone do when they don't understand economics... they make class warfare speeches about the 1%.  That is all Bernie knows HOW to do. His misunderstanding of economics is so bad that he thinks taxing the upper 1% more will some how trickle down into everyone else's bank account. It won't. Neither will taxing the 1% more do anything to increase revenue for things like education or infrastructure, or anything else. In fact, we would end up with less tax revenue, not more. There is not one thing in the Bernie plan that has anything to do with economic growth... like what? Nothing in the Bernie plan does anything to create job. Nor would his plan do anything for education. And here is why? Bernie's plan results in less economic growth, and therefore... LESS money for things like... education, and infrastructure (among other things). Even worse... here is yet another idea people come up with when it comes from people who don't understand economics.. like Bernie...     Artificially raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. \u201cArtificially\u201d because the Bernie way is to simply legislate higher wages into existence. Bernie mentioned in the video about corporations moving operations to China? Simply legislating higher wages into existence would only create more disparity between U.S. wages and Chinese wages.  Clearly a bad idea for reasons too obvious to bother explaining. Or maybe the reasons are just obvious to everyone except people like Bernie... who doesn't understand economics. In any event, REAL wage growth can only come when it is BECAUSE of, or the result of... economic growth. In other words, increased productivity. Artificially raising wages, simply legislating it into existence (without the economic growth that CAUSES wage growth), would only result in inflation and /or jobs going somewhere else.  To put it another way,... to think we can increase standards of living by simply legislating higher wages into existence is as silly as thinking we can increase standards of living by \u2026 doubling money supply. We may as well be wasting our time passing a law banning bad weather on Saturdays. Artificially trying to create wage growth by simply legislating it into existence doesn't do anything for you in real terms, or real standards of living. In fact, it would only have the effect of making it even more difficult for business to compete with.. China.    So why does Bernie not understand economics, economic growth, business growth.. REAL wage growth? Why does Bernie not understand a competitive environment? Here is the reason...    We should never suggest that to understand economics a person MUST have been a business leader.  However, there are two legitimate ways to understand the above things mentioned (economic growth, etc)... 1) be directly involved in economic growth .. or 2) LISTEN to the people who have been directly involved in economic growth.  Bernie has never done either of those things. Regarding number 1 (above), Bernie has never done anything his entire life except be an establishment politician and writing a book...  about being an establishment politician. Regarding number 2 (above), Bernie doesn't \u2026 LISTEN... as we saw in that video. He was a poor student in college. Fifty-two years later he is STILL a poor student... like in the video we just saw... bad listener.        Bernie Sanders doesn't understand economics and for reasons just explained. His entire life.. he speaks and argues (as in that video) when he should be listening. Anyone with a reasonable amount of common sense would have recognized an opportunity to listen, take notes, and ask the obvious questions,.. \u201cwhat regulations are you referring to? What can Washington do? In the interest of economic growth, job growth, .. how can we help?\u201d In other words, an opportunity to be a good STUDENT (and maybe for the first time in his entire life). Blown opportunity \u2026 Bernie.     Bernie should go back to his ivory tower where he can safely convince himself that he actually knows something... a place where he can continue being a legend.. in his own mind. Bernie's ivory tower is a place where he can speak and not listen. A place where Bernie  can try to convince people to covet the 1%, instead of doing something that REALLY help the \u201clittle guys\u201d, \u2026 like focusing on economic growth, increased productivity, so the \u201clittle guys\u201d can have more for THEMSELVES. The politics of coveting, a politics that does absolutely nothing for the \u201clittle guy\u201d \u2026 AND IT NEVER WILL. Economic growth, expanding productivity, REAL wage growth... when it is because of economic growth, that is what helps the \u201clittle guy.\u201d  Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any other economic system in the history of the world. Stay in your ivory tower where you can forget that you never succeeded at anything your entire life, except being a legend in your own mind.

No more private insurance. Program rollout to occur over a 4 yr period.  Currently Medicare only covers 80% of qualified medical expenses.  If we simply expand MCR to everyone private insurances will STILL be necessary to cover the 20%that MCR does not cover. Why is no one discussing this? A few months ago Bernie was NOT supporting MCR for all but he specifically used the verbiage of, \"\"'ONE PAYER SYSTEM\"\". I support a ONE PAYER SYSTEM where we pay $0 out of pocket for healthcare.  This is an important distinction that no one ever addresses.     Clarifying this would help most Americans understand what politicians mean.     Also, I find it hard to believe that physician & insurance lobbyists are going to simply accept this idea. I think physicians would revolt.

We don't give a shit about our Cambodian neighbors however many be in they crib lol  or your local Indian dude at the convenient store. We all got different cultures and that's dope  but your community is your people regardless and to hate a person or something because is different is just ignorance and people who live/act that way will always suffer the karma or negative backlash they deserve.

Fed job guarantee was one of the    pillars of communism where the government controls the means of    production, not through market need or demand, but through quota. beyond   the promise of job security and benefits, fed job guarantee essentially   created a class of employees where they were entitled to a job   regardless of qualification, talent or performance. Everyone had a job   sure, but the productivity was so low because there was no incentive to   innovate and productivity was hampered by laziness bureaucracy and   inefficiency. As an example, my dad was a doctor and director of a   medium sized hospital in Hunan, Changsha birth place of mao, made only   75 dollars a month back in 1989. After 1991, post soviet union and tian   an men,  the government broke their promise and let go tons of the   people from state owned businesses, including hospitals. My dad left for   America under the title of self funded researcher and we eventually all   moved because the writing was on the wall that there were going to be   massive shifts towards market based economy.    The only country with a large scale fed job guarantee today is North Korea  and their people are literally starving.    Additionally,   a 15 dollar min  wage will simply force corporations expedite the   automation of their  businesses to reduce cost, Mcdonalds will  invest   more heavily automated  kitchen and service kiosks, or like target, cut   shift and hours to  reduce benefits. 15 dollars min wage does not help   stay at home moms,  disabled, retired seniors, or people who are already   at 15 dollars an  hour or above.

Sharing an article about who Bernie is:   One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps, and it was all downhill from there.  Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail. \u201cHe was a shi**y carpenter,\u201d a friend told Politico Magazine. \u201cHis carpentry was not going to support him, and didn\u2019t.\u201d  Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about \"\"masturbation and rape\u201d and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was \"\"always poor\"\" and his \u201celectricity was turned off a lot.\u201d They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment -- and this is what his friends had to say about him.  The only thing he was good at was talking \u2026 non-stop \u2026 about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off. \u201cThe whole quality of life in America is based on greed,\u201d the bitter layabout said. \u201cI believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation.\u201d  So he tried politics, starting his own socialist party. Four times he ran for Vermont public office, and four times he lost -- badly. He never attracted more than single-digit support -- even in the People\u2019s Republic of Vermont. In his 1971 bid for U.S. Senate, the local press said the 30-year-old \"\"Sanders describes himself as a carpenter who has worked with 'disturbed children.\u2019 \u201d In other words, a real winner.  He finally wormed his way into the Senate in 2006, where he still ranks as one of the poorest members of Congress. Save for a municipal pension, Sanders lists no assets in his name. All the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife\u2019s. He does, however, have as much as $65,000 in credit-card debt.  Sure, Sanders may not be a hypocrite, but this is nothing to brag about. His worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other \u201coutsiders\"\" in the race for the White House, including a billionaire developer, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a Fortune 500 CEO.

They ARE NOT recognized  our constitution or democracy. \u201cThe party of the republican\u201d wasn\u2019t formed until 1890. Our constitution and DEMOCRACY were already established. We just figured this is how it was. And the political parties have the balls to challenge our constitution and laws! The same constitution and laws they swore to uphold and protect! Were not in a constitutional crisis  we are in a war for our democracy by 2 political parties foreign to our democracy plus Russia and and trump has aligned with dictators. Republicans have fox  their personal propaganda  \u201cnews\u201d that is intentionally manipulating us to \u201cvote republican\u201d. Start reporting fox as misleading and everything else. They aren\u2019t news. Republicans are openly asking foreign countries to help them sway our election for them. If you looked at the bottom of the \u201cwish dictator trump\u201d spammed birthday card it was funded by \u201crepublicans.inc. They have their own company because the honor of being our president is business to them. WE ARE NOTHING BUT VOTES TO THEM. I remember when families would eat dinner together  had time to do family things and I wondered what happened to that. Both parents had to start working to make ends meet  the era of \u201clatchkey kids\u201d. Instead of working on raising wages to stop this  the rich politicians had stricter laws imposed that made it negligence. So now for a majority of us a babysitter  day care has to be part of the budget.       My town used to be a bustling town of around 42,000. If ya didn\u2019t have a job, you were lazy. We were booming with union manufacturing factories. It was a blast! Most of your friends had money too (not rich) so us younger generation could afford to do sporadic shet.. and party.. alot. (We were youngsters, what do ya expect? lol).   Because a politician wanted his special interests/big business to make more money to avoid unions NAFTA was forced on us Americans. It destroyed the city I grew up in. We literally lost 20 good paying factories, mostly union jobs because of nafta they were allowed to move to Mexico. My town is now a dead town with around 17,000 people either to old, can\u2019t afford, etc to leave. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to be working 2-3 jobs to make it and some still can\u2019t afford transportation. Nuthin but the minimum wage fast food joints that haven\u2019t went under left. I agreed with trump that nafta is the \u201cworst deal ever\u201d and was happy \u201che\u2019s gonna eliminate it\u201d.. All he did was change the name. So because of politicians we vote in to represent us, Mexico\u2019s economy was boosted with 20 manufacturing jobs that don\u2019t require fair pay for employees, ford, gm, etc. Who are \u201cbased\u201d in America are not only profiting because, last I knew, they pay some Mexicans employees $3 an hour that compared to union wages ($12- $20 an hour that they can afford) that\u2019s a huge profit boost. On top of selling their vehicles to us Americans for more than the cost in other countries. Like big pharmacies.That politicians have been \u201cinvestigating for years\u201d when it\u2019s obvious they would rather sell a medicine to Canada for $8 but are charging fellow Americans over $1000 for the same medicine with the knowledge that Americans are dying because who can afford it but the rich. I\u2019d bet nafta was done by a republican but the fact is that it didn\u2019t bother democrats because they\u2019re special interests profited too. Politicians are so \u201cdedicated\u201d to representing us that they only talk about issues that concern us that they have divided us to where we\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats because of they\u2019re loyalty to special interests that invest in them. But they only care about the pockets of people who have different concerns like trans gender who are considered \u201cswing voters\u201d because the swing votes are a major factor in winning. We have republican political party encouraging Americans to get violent with other Americans because we have no choice but to divide over the issues politicians have split and out of spite for opposing party, will never address if they hold presidency. Solely because of political parties those of us who know our planet is in trouble, we \u201chave\u201d to vote and hope for a spineless traitor democrat to get elected whose strategy to stop dicktator trump while he sets roots deeper in our democracy everyday is to ask trumps family and administration for a f in intervention and will pray for trump!?! Since trump declared another \u201cstate of emergency\u201d he has the ability to declare martial law and deploy troops. WE HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER! Stop debating politics, start discussing strategies. Set up set up secure ways to communicate (break out walkie talkies, ham radios) the government has illegally put out to much information miners. Unregulated Artificial intelligence with intuitive algorithms is collecting every single piece of our most personal information from all our social sites AND our cell phones. The government has illegally been using facial recognition software to track white males, for now. THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY is to vote for DIRECT DEMOCRACY, our president would be able to address all major issues at the same time while president. We would be the ones voting in laws and voting them out. Instead of waiting for politicians to take years accomplishing something we could help the president get the laws he needs to get shet done. We need to make political parties illegal since its conflict of interest to claim they represent us. And try ALL who didn\u2019t uphold their oath as traitors, trump and his administration need tried as terrorist. We have to take away the electoral colleges ability to override our election results. Y\u2019all are picking candidates like we have the final say. How tf can trump still be president after it\u2019s proven the election was influenced by Russia!?! That should be automatic grounds for revote. If you would be interested in a plan that would eliminate republican and democrat parties and give us a natural non political party of democracy that could work on all the issues in same term, for our democracy in 2020.

Would it have been so difficult for him to have responded  instead  with \"\"We had our differences  but I'll carefully consider any advice that Hillary Clinton chooses to give me?\"\" Predictable follow-up question by Meghan McCain: \"\"So  you're going to meet with her?\"\" Proposed Sanders response: \"\"Sure. Since you suggested it  I'll do it.\"\" [everyone laughs]     What an awful response. While Sanders was sitting in the center of a table flanked by four women, two on each side, and as their the guest of honor, he essentially said \"\"No, I'm not going to meet with the first woman Presidential candidate in U.S. history, as well as the one who almost unseated Obama in the primary in 2008, as well as the one who earned nearly three million more votes in the popular 2016 election, as well as the United States' third woman Secretary of State, and the one I told my supporters to vote for.\"\" Utterly tone-deaf at any time, to say nothing of in the age of MeToo. Meghan McCain had checkmated him right there on the show, but Sanders either couldn't bring himself to admit it or, worse, couldn't recognize that it had happened.     So, who was right in 2016? The Sanders voters who listened to their preferred Commander-in-Chief and voted for Clinton, or the estimated 216,332 Sanders voters who ignored his orders and voted for Trump in the three key swing states (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan) that handed Trump the election by a collective margin of just 77,744 votes? Sanders' messaging is inconsistent.     Additionally, there's Bernie Sanders again, saying that he \"\"will support [any Democratic] candidate, because what's most important is that Trump be defeated.\"\" As I've already said on my Facebook wall, the most important thing is not for Trump to be defeated (negative messaging); it is to produce the best Democratic candidate possible (positive messaging). That candidate, by definition, will also be a candidate who can defeat Trump. As I've also said on my wall, no Democratic front-runner should want Bernie Sanders' negative support on that metric AT ALL, because a) it didn't work for Clinton in 2016 and b) it didn't work for Clinton because, when you suggest that someone should vote for a candidate so as to defeat the other, it sends the distinct message that the candidate you are supporting is very, very weak on his or her own merits. And, finally, as I've also said on my wall, the most important thing is not for Trump to be defeated, because theoretically there could be a candidate more dangerous than Trump. If the only bar that Sanders sets for the Democratic Party is to produce a candidate who is better than Trump, then that's no bar at all. Do you know what can rise when there's no bar at all? A dictator. Now, I'm not suggesting that the Democratic Party could credibly put forth a dictator. But, a Republican primary challenge could. Bottom line: Sanders' negative messaging isn't just awful, it's dangerous.     Sanders could be kryptonite for a Democratic front-runner. I also have strong misgivings regarding the Democratic Party signalling that it will allow Sanders, a lifelong Independent, to take up its banner at all, let alone if he becomes the front-runner. Any different Democratic front-runner who seeks Sanders' primary voters should make clear to Sanders that he or she won't accept Sanders' negative messaging in the general campaign, period. And, if the Democratic Party, as a whole, knows what's good for it, then it will advise the lifelong Independent, Bernie Sanders, to cease that negative messaging immediately.     www facebook/paul.ronco.1\" ", "Ukrainian Bot": "You can't be from a jewish background and a lower midclass family at same time.

The Republican vs Democrat paradigm doesn't actually exist - it's more for the masses' 'consumption' as passive 'consumers'. Interestingly enough, Republican vs Democrat doesn't really exist - however your fighting, discord and distraction from the real values and meaning of life does. See the end goal of these unscrupulous schemers is not a matter of Left vs Right ideological values, but the destructive 'results' (fragmentation, hatred, conflict) of this design that result from it. It is the same with the Muslims vs the Christians (and the War on Terror)..that paradigm has also been designed to bring about the agenda I've stated above.     So, really it's about time you though long and hard about what's really going on in the World and why it is so critical that you don't fall for it. These people/rulers are not Sages or men and women with tremendous amounts of humanity, wisdom and love, who care about your collective wellbeing and future, we must try and find those types of leaders...but you certainly won't find these long-awaited Sages from the political sphere.   Man doesn't have a lot of time left, due to the aforementioned, he has about 25-35 years left before, a time of planned 'purification' befalls him. You will know when it comes - it starts with a economic depression, combined political, social and environmental calamities, greater, more frequent wars and eventually, a WW3 scenario. Man has forgot how to live on Earth and the people who guide and influence him through the media ...only do so to control, enslave and mislead him.

Watch stephanie kelton explaining how public funding works on MMT ", "Xyz Same": "\"Corporate tools pretend that people are _fond of their insurers._ The industry has not earned itself a good reputation to put it mildly. A PUBLIC INSURANCE AGENCY as servant in the background would be liked much - or get little attention because it works smoothly and cost-efficiently  to make good healthcare happen for everyone.    \u00a0(citizens in single payer countries do not pay attention to the public non-profit insurance agency - they would grow very fond of it if they ever had to deal with the U.S. health  insurance scene:     characteristics of insurance coverage by a _public non-profit_ agency   a) it  is not as overpriced (which is easy)      b)  having that insurance card gives you full !! coverage to everythingthat is worthy of a First world country medical treatment.      Millions of people have that expectation, and they ALL get the same treatments in the same facilities. If that would not function or if treatment would not be up to date *  - there would be enormous political pressure to change that - because the patients have the exact same situation.     Doctors like to have the latest tools, and the pharma representatives will tell them about the latest drugs - so it WILL leak. In the single payer nations advertising for healthcare is very restricted.  If something would not be right the media will report (they will not lose ad money over it - they did not get any to begin with)    \u00a0The doctors have a list (an database in the computer) - for instance about medical drugs, that is updated all the time (new are added, some might be removed if they prove to be problematic or less effective, etc,)     Or transport by helicopter with a doctor - which is an option.    The task of the agency is to negotiate good prices for these services. And they have contracts with small ! doctor practices and hospitals (many of them are also public non-profits, no chains). The hospitals and doctors get MIXED compensation: some of it is fix, some of it is for certain treatments and tests. That is meant to make sure that rigging the system is too complicated and would not pay off.   For instance that an institution would  push certain tests when they are not really necessary (which would be hard for the agency to control in each and every case).    Negotiating the prices (for instance for transport by helicopter)    The task of the doctors and hospitals is the complex one: to decide what they will use in the individual case. For instance: where do we send the injured victims in a car accident. Is the hospital that is best suited to deal with the patient far away - read more than 20 driving minutes  ?  Would a helicopter transport (with an emergency doctor on board) be warranted ?     The DOCTORS MAKE the DECISION And the profit motive is completely irrelevant. Nor would the agency intervene with the decision. I know the system of Austria very well: the ambulance staff could make the decision to order the helicopter. That did turn work because they too often ordered the helicopter when it was not necessary. And - sometimes the standard country hospital nearby will be the best choice even in an emergency. They can stabilize the patient - and can airlift him or her to the more specialized unit later should that be necessary.    So the authority to make that decision is usually reserved now to doctors (and the respond time has been improved, meaning the time it takes on average till a doctor shows up at the scene).     c) there will be NO healthcare questions, no comparing of plans. you have a job that pays over 500 USD per month - the company (no matter the size) MUST sign you up. Which takes 5 minutes. (Name, adress, birth date, SS number, plus of family members  if they are dependents - it is an announcement to the agency, which the company is mandated to make on the first day ).     And they must match the wage deductions (which are a percentage of the wage). That is a recruiting advantage for small companies and start-ups btw. Their employees have the same coverage than the employees of multinationals.    If you have insurance you (and dependent family members) have 100 % coverage,  no exceptions, (almost) no co-pays (trivial amounts for drugs etc), no deductibles. No denial of treatments that are medically warranted - it would be the denial for millions of people. If one does not get a certain chemo when the DOCTOR thinks it would the best treatmen - no one would get it. It would be a shitstorm on stereoides.     Having a job with more than 500 USD monthly pay does not only force you to participate (and pay a modest contribution) - it also gives you the right to get coverage - full coverage.

I'm Bernie Sanders. I'm running for president and I'm asking you today to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign of 1 million active volunteers in every state in our country.       Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination in the general election. our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic social racial and environmental justice.  Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interest that dominates our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives.       our campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, and all forms of discrimination. our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country on earth while we end voter suppression, citizens united, and outrageous levels of gerrymandering. our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just a few.  we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. we should not have a grotesque level of wealth inequality in which three billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.   we should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance. even more, who are underinsured, and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline. we should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement. we should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children.       we should not have a regressive tax system in which large profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes. make no mistake about it. the powerful special interest in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. they have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties. the only way we will win this election and create a government and an economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement the likes of which has never been seen in American history.   they may have the money and the power. we have the people. that is why we need 1 million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign. you know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. we are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe, and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction. I am running for president because now more than ever we need leadership that brings us together, not divides us up. Women and men, black white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native-born and immigrant, now is the time for us to stand together.       I'm running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1%. we need a president that understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and constructing the affordable housing we desperately need.  I am running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multinational corporations. we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women, and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave. I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology.   I'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has but by how it treats the most vulnerable, the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor. I'm running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics.    We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  I'm running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All single-payer program.       I am running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country. I'm running for president because we need to have the best-educated workforce in the world. it is totally counterproductive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. that is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and lower student debt.       I am running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. we need to invest in jobs and education for our kids not more jails and incarceration. we need to end the destructive war on drugs private prisons in cash bail and bring about major Police Department reform.  I'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move the comprehensive immigration reform. we need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum.   I'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. we need to take on the NRA expand background checks and the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I am running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy, and world peace.       the United States must leave the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change, militarism, authoritarianism, and global wealth inequality. that is why we need 1 million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish all of these goals.  needless to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world now let me give you some very good news that we should all be very proud of three years ago. during our 2016 campaign when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were radical and were extreme. we were told that medicare-for-all, a $15 an hour minimum, wage free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy stop paying their fair share of taxes, we were told that all of these concepts were ideas that the American people would never accept. well, three years have come and gone and as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans. together you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution now it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.       so here is my question for you, will you stand with me as part of a million-person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic nomination, not only win the general election, but most importantly help transform this country, so that finally we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few. together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic racial, social, and environmental justice, and together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country. brothers and sisters, if we stand together there is no limit to what we can accomplish. I hope you'll join me. thank you very much\" ", "2019-02-21T08:01:43.000Z": "Mathew Hastings \"So his ideas are the same as 2016  free this and free that all while saying the top one percent are going to pay for it.

Expanding background checks and raising the legal age to purchase firearms has little to no effect of gun violence or gun deaths. Rates of gun violence are more strongly correlated to socioeconomics than anything else. Most criminals know that they cannot legally get a gun from a gun shop so they turn to other methods of acquiring them. In fact according to FBI data 90% of guns used in crimes are stolen. An expanded background check system wouldn't stop mass shooters, as most mass shooters in recent history had no criminal history or mental illness. So what criminals would this stop?    2. Banning assault rifles or bump-stocks would not stop mass shootings. The twin oaks shooter in California used a pistol, the Virginia tech shooter used a pistol, the Annapolis shooter used a shotgun, the Columbine shooters used pistols and pistol-caliber carbines. Plus the legal definition of assault rifle is based purely on cosmetic features and unfairly includes firearms that are not assault rifles by design. Bump-firing can be easily done without a bump-stock, in fact there are tutorial videos on how to do this on YouTube. Plus, calling for the banning of certain guns and gun accessories because they were used in a mass shooting comes off as being reactionary and scapegoating.    3. Stricter gun laws dont necessarily equal safer states/countries. California has some of the strictest if not the most draconian gun laws in the country and yet 8 deadly mass shootings happened there in the last few years. Mexico and the continent of Europe has stricter gun laws than America and yet illegal guns still make their way into these countries/continents from America and russia/slavic countries respectively. In the formers case the drug war as well as the ATF's incompetence fuels the violence. In Europes case it's the migrant crisis and the loose arms trade policies of Russia and slavic countries that causes it.     4. Mass shootings like the one at Parkland high school represent less than a percent of all gun violence in the country. In fact 66% of all gun deaths in America are suicides, 15% of all gun deaths are homicides, and the rest are accidents. The only reason that mass shootings are so overly publicized is that the media and elites can use them to push their anti-gun, anti-freedom agenda. Plus instances of citizens using guns to defend their homes and themselves are generally more frequent and a lot less publicized because it contradicts the agenda of the elites. I dont think that law-abiding gun owners and citizens should be deprived of their rights just because a madman abused his.      Edit: if you want police department reform, start by forbidding them from issuing gun permits or licenses. Based on recent happenings, the last group of people I want to decide who gets to exercise their constitutional rights, it's the police.\" ", "2019-02-20T12:21:27.000Z": "john brountas \"Lmfao   I wouldn't be surprised   If he was elected and had Hillary as his running mate he would quit just so she could be president..\" ", "2019-02-20T12:20:16.000Z": "john brountas He talks some serious shit .

That way you are able to increase taxes and this will  produce more poverty.  4) Gun control Remove people's ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to  create a police state  5) Welfare - Take control of every aspect of people's lives (food, housing and income).  6) Education Take control of what people read and listen to; take control of what children learn in school.  THINK COMMON CORE.  7) Religion Remove the belief in God from the government and schools.  8) Class warfare Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor.

AaIt doesn\u2019t get much better than John Binder when it comes to reporting on illegal immigration and he\u2019s got the latest information from the Congressional Budget Office.    At least nearly one in seven illegal aliens shielded from deportation by former President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would end up on Medicaid if they were given amnesty, a government report states.  A report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reveals the impact a DACA amnesty for nearly 800,000 to 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for the Obama-era program would have on American citizens.  in a spending deal in which President Trump\u2019s administration caves on its pro-American immigration agenda that specifically excluded amnesty for illegal aliens.    Who out there thinks that\u2019s a good idea?  Previous research by the Center for Immigration Studies indicates that the average immigrant household in the U.S. takes 44 percent more Medicaid money than the average American household. The research also noted that 56 percent of households led by illegal aliens have at least one person on Medicaid.  Our entitlement programs are already out of control. We can\u2019t afford to pay for the Americans in this country. Let alone non-citizens.  Kris Kobach also thinks we need to make sure we get E-verify in any potential deal.  John Binder had that story as well.  In an appearance on FNC\u2019s \u201cFox News @ Night\u201d on Tuesday, Kansas Secretary of State and gubernatorial hopeful Kris Kobach said any plan that gives amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens shielded from deportation bythe Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy would \u201ccause a surge in illegal immigration.\u201d  He added that surge in illegal immigration should be combatted with multiple reforms, including mandatory E-Verify, which would bar employers from hiring illegal aliens for U.S. Jobs . But Democrats deflect by Calling Trump a racist which as we all know is a classic Democrat talking point that is strangely effective with low information voters on the left.          We always hear about putting Americans first now that Trump is in charge. Let\u2019s hope that happens here.

You shouldn\u2019t believe because Mr. Biden belongs to the Democratic Party he is a real democratic person  because is not like that  that gentleman represents the interests of the big corporations of this country. An example of that was when still he was the USA vice president during the government of Obama. Mr. Biden went to the Dominican Republic once  to demand to President Danilo Medina that President Medina \"\"should\"\" give up to the demands imposed by the Barrick Gold transnational Corporation in charge of exploiting the Dominican gold  although this exploitation was to the detriment of the Dominican environment and  therefore  of all Dominicans . There were many massive protests against the exploitation of the gold mine by the Barrick Gold. Mr. Biden was a spokesman -representative of those exploiters  he went to the Dominican Presidential Palace in a very aggressive way  like someone saying: Hey man  where is my gold? To the Dominican\u2019s president.     Age is not a problem my fellow Americans, Trump and Bernie are more less same age. Senator Sanders is the only hope to straighten out this nation. This country is ruled by the most pernicious oligarchic group, a small group of rich and military people who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to wiping out the whole world in a thermo -nuclear war if their interests are threaten and they have to do it. Those are real mad people, the real ones, they are insane, this is not a Hollywood comedy, it is a real world, the truth.

And yet, we still don\u2019t have by the time, by our own invention, the so called 5G internet system: Is it not very sad and shameful to hear too much BS talking by both, the right wind segments of the Democrats and Republicans apologists? The only agenda for those apologists is war, because war means business as usual. For that reason they love so much the Military Industrial Complex. That group of oligarch don\u2019t love USA, of course they talk and talk a lot of BS by saying that they love the country but that is not true, they don\u2019t: Their only love is money-money-money.   Bernie is different from those oligarch apologists. If we can elect him, our youth will have the opportunity to expand their skill and talent. Education free as a right, not as a privilege; decent wages; universal health care for all American people; a very modern country with all modernized infrastructures, then we may compete very easy in the development arena with the rest of the world. USA will flourish. Good bye to wars! Everybody in the world will love USA once again, this time, forever.       Come on, my fellow Americans, give it a chance! You can do it.

The Democrat Politicians are part of the misdirection and to brainwash that the world will end in 12 years unless we hand control of the money printers over to the Democrats one more time before they crash the economy.  Omar is part of  the Democrat Politicians plan for a coup of the USA Gov.    Read on so that you will have an increased insight on the  insidious Democrat plan.    Here in the USA we have an election opportunity in 2020 to replace all our Treasonous Democrat politicians who are coming after our capable rifles.   We will be successful in this endeavor.         DEMOCRAT COUP !!!!!     See the sinister Democrat End Game in the USA.  You will be disarmed and enslaved as the Democrats Continue to Force our Borders Open to any dangerous migrants that will assist in the coup by voting Democrat !!!!!    With Benghazi Obama's help, Democrats used Mexican migrants in a Coup to take over the California Government.  The Democrats force our borders open and are using your tax dollars for welfare to support each  of those Mexican Democrat Migrant Invader Voters - and are now busing thousands of Mexican Migrants over the border every day into border states !!!!      These are not skilled workers, and some are child traffickers and drug dealers as part of the Mexican Sinaloa Drug Cartel which is now the largest Drug Cartel in the USA ....thanks to Democrats promising Sanctuary Cities with the hands of Ice Agents tied...which is any Drug Cartel gangsters Dream, and the root cause of these Migrant Caravans !!!    Democrats have removed all immigration policy....Most of these migrants do not show up to their immigration court date, but the Democrats have voted to allow all migrants to vote Democrat On-Line !!!    And with a swipe of the pen Democrat Muslim Obama helped to rewrite immigration policy !!!!    Because of this Democrat Coup, California will never see a non-Mexican sitting in the Los Angeles Mayors office and senior criminal Mexican Senators who falsified immigration documents are now  controlling the California Senate in Sacramento.      Now Democrat Politicians are attempting another coup at the the USA national level by importing Islam.    Take a close look at the Minnesota and Michigan Democrat Party winners !!!!    This happened FAST !!!   I suspect that Merkel was attempting the same to gain votes and remain in office.    This California coup was successful. As Mexican Democrats now own the California Gov.    And the same corrupt Democrats are now shipping and flying in a concentration of Muslims into Minnesota and Michigan which was also a well planned coup of those states.      Democrat Politicians are also shipping and flying Millions of Muslims into Californian and New York.   As the coup in these states is critical to the Democrat treasonous agenda to disarm and enslave !!!     VOTE !!!!    And Remove all Democrat Politicians in 2020.    A Quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero - Addressing the Roman Senate in the year (43 B.C.)    \"\"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within.   An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly.   But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys,   heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor;   he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments,   he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation,   he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city,   he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.\"\"\" ", "MadCowProductions": "IF YOU TAKE THE GUNS YOU WILL START A CIVIL WAR. ", "Karen Schumer": "\"We need to do something!!!!!!!!!!

ALL PERSONS born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are CITIZENS of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. NO STATE shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the PRIVILEGES OR IMMUNITIES OF CITIZENS of the United States; NOR SHALL ANY STATE deprive ANY PERSON within its jurisdiction THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS. (emphasis, added).  https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-says-doesnt-intend-195113050.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index  On that point, we agree with Sanders: Education and Healthcare for ALL AMERICANS! And that's NOT \"\"socialism!\"\" Are corporate tax-breaks \"\"socialism?\"\" Well, neither are expenditures that care for the American people who work to pay those taxes! Don't we find money for corporate business tax breaks, tax-shelters, and other incentives? Don't the rich and wealthy have tax-shelters, foundations, and trust funds or \"\"secret bank accounts\"\" in which to hide their money so that they don't pay any taxes?  Social Security Trust Fund has always been \"\"in the black\"\" - but it is CONGRESS that took $2.14 TRILLION from the fund and replaced them with \"\"IOU's\"\" -- It is time that CONGRESS returns this money, and that money did not belong in \"\"the general fund\"\" so that they can spend it on their \"\"pork-barrel-pet projects!\"\" This money belongs to the American people who paid FICA and other Social Security taxes!  In addition: We need EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE recognized as basic Human civil rights! Who wants a sick and illiterate working population in this age of HIGH TECHNOLOGY? Does not our government find $868 BILLION for the military, including so-called \"\"foreign aid\"\" as $3.8 BILLION for the \"\"Zionist State of the Jews\"\" in the Middle-East every year; how about taxpayers' money for roads, police departments, sheriff departments, all government departments and agencies; how about money for TAX-BREAKS to the top 1% wealthy class to the tune of $1.3 TRILLION; how about all the TAX INCREMENT INCENTIVES (T.I.F.'s) to businesses in the guise that they'll \"\"create jobs\"\" for our workers and laborers; or how about TAX SUBSIDIES TO CORPORATIONS like EXXON-MOBIL that had $14 Billion in profits in fiscal year 2009 but paid Zero federal taxes! ALL these programs and revenues are coming from TAXPAYERS' MONEY! How come the Supreme Court declared a \"\"corporate business\"\" to be \"\"a person\"\" under the law but that takes precedence over us, WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, real PERSONS who are the laborers and workers who make this country the greatest nation on Planet Earth! So too, our government can find money to provide decent Healthcare and Education to our children whose parents and other care-givers are paying the taxes to take care of \"\"the country's business.\"\" So, Healthcare and Education are as important as all these other expenditures that keep the country working and moving forward! Education and Healthcare are long-overdue necessary mandates for our government, as constitutional obligations that attend to \"\"providing for our general welfare!\"\" Food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education ought to be held as NECESSARY BASIC HUMAN CIVIL RIGHTS which our form of free government must provide in the same manner that it finds money for everything else on our politicians' agenda! We're all paying taxes as \"\"the American people\"\" -- and \"\"what's good for the goose is also good for the gander!\"\" How come such \"\"corporate $$$ welfare\"\" or \"\"corporate socialism\"\" as de facto official government policy is not called \"\"entitlements\"\" when they've been happening so regularly, as opposed to working Americans who, through no fault of their own, must receive government assistance because Wall Street CRASHES the economy to \"\"throw them in the streets!\"\" Congress allowed corporate businesses to move their plants overseas at taxpayers' expense! \"\"The rug has been pulled out from under their feet:\"\" How can they \"\"make a living\"\" when their jobs have been \"\"out-sourced\"\" abroad? Those corporate businesses don't stop operating for profits \u2014 why should our working people pay the price for their excesses and abuses of the law? Thus, Fairness and justice demand that our government starts treating us equally in accordance with the 14th Amendment that has secured for us \"\"THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS!\"\" Given that a corporation is a PERSON under the Constitution of the United States of America, WE THE PEOPLE, the American people, as individual PERSONS under the Constitution of the United States of America, must also enjoy the same treatment under the federal and State tax laws in our great nation! As persons, we are equal to corporations, also declared persons, under the jurisdiction of the United States for taxation purposes and other financial considerations, and we must receive equal treatment from our Government. Government cannot disparage or abridge our privileges and immunities of citizenship as PERSONS by denying us both due process of law and THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS under the Constitution of the United States of America for taxation and other financial or revenue purposes! Therefore, Government can find and must find money for every obligation that our public officials deem necessary to keep our country running and prospering --- including public education and public healthcare for the American people! All government revenues are TAXPAYERS' MONEY --- How come it is being used for some things and not for others? Why is our government \"\"playing favorites?\"\" Who decides how we spend taxpayers' money? WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE: We have a form of free government founded upon \"\"JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED!\"\" SO, let's all collaborate together to make it work that way!

If you make lower class colleges for the average public school kids  they will still have a class difference. Non of the now ivy league colleges are going to teach for less and is the government going to subsidies tuition costs for all? Just seems a bit unfair to lower income folks  to have rich kids getting stuff free that for decades  lower income kids could never have.  I think instead of raising income all the way around, make things cost less. Every time u raise income, the companies pass the cost on to the people getting the raises.

When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result.

The \u201cimage to the beast\u201d represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas. The \u201cmark of the beast\u201d still remains to be defined.    After the warning against the worship of the beast and his image, the prophecy declares, \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Since those who keep God's commandments are thus placed in contrast with those that worship the beast and his image and receive his mark, it follows that the keeping of God's  law, on the one hand, and its violation, on the other, will make the distinction between the worshipers of God and the worshipers of the beast.\" ", "Eric Rudn": "He is soooo dumb is Umbelivable ", "txync": "\"They were just hoping for a yes  good he explained that it's balanced out by paying nothing extea for healthcare.

", "Mikey Fagi": "\"DANGER TO WALL STREET PARASITES: if the Medicare for all plan proposed   by Senator Warren is passed, the US may rein in its gigantic, and   radically increasing health care costs. Thus, the gigantic profits   expected by the little banksters who own HMOs and insurers (who must   salivate at the prospect of getting more huge premiums from millenials   and some baby boomers each year in future and then denying them coverage   by some clever strategem) will be severely diminished or mostly   eliminated. It may soon be a sad time to be a bankster.    Senator Warren may get elected, so the banksters tremble! She (and Sen. Bernie   Sanders, of course) is the only non-corrupt politician with the courage   to stand up to the HMOs, insurance industry giants, AMA cronies, and   billionaire/millionaire bankster families that own the insurers, HMOs,   and pharmaceutical giants. She is the only one with the courage to   propose a property tax on the wealthiest banksters.    American medical costs are among the highest in the world and are increasing at   ludicrously high rates, so less and less care will be provided because   US salaries are not truly increasing. Medical costs went from 6.9% of   GDP to 17.9% in 2017. See   https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-spending-healthcare-changed-time/      US medical care quality is not great (worst among developed nations) and   the insurance and HMO bureaucracies discourage doctors from providing   treatments that they deem expensive to maximize profits. See   https://www.ajmc.com/contributor/julie-potyraj/2016/02/the-quality-of-us-healthcare-compared-with-the-world.    Thus, HMOs and insurers effectively want to reserve to themselves the   decision of who lives and who dies, which they claim that Medicare for   All would make. See   https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-27-mn-39492-story.html.      Insurers and HMOS have a profit motive to maximize how much they make by   increasing premiums, increasing deductibles and co-pays, and minimizing   what care they give to patients. If older patients die quickly and do   not linger in their hospitals, that is more profitable for HMOs and   insurers. See https://pnhp.org/news/quality-of-care-lower-in-for-profit-hmos-than-in-non-profits/.    Thus, HMOs and insurers deceptively claim that Medicare for all would   do what they are already doing, denying or limiting care to patients, so   they (HMOs and insurers) currently actually do act as death panels. They want to continue to be able to act as death panels: deciding that you must die early if you need an expensive treatment when you get older, so their profits are maximized.    By encouraging foreign doctors and nurses to come here and practice, e.g., by allowing them in as nurse practitioners (the doctors) and nurse assistants (the RNs from other   countries), and by eliminating HMOs, insurers, and the AMA influence, we   could drastically reduce medical costs. Many foreign doctors dream of   coming to the US and earning the gigantic salaries paid to US doctors;   most doctors in the rest of the world are not paid as well.      Otherwise, with what other candidates propose, the US medical costs will keep   growing at ludicrous rates, while they do not grow in other countries.   Most other candidates are too scared of the HMOs, insurers, and AMA to   deal with the actual problems.         (State insurance commissioners are almost always corrupt and can usually be called polistitutes, because they will do whatever the billionaires and millionaires who are the owners of insurers or HMOs or AMA want, so long as those persons later fund their future political campaigns. We need an independent ministry of justice dedicated to investigating and imprisoning corrupt politicians, such as most insurance commissioners.)    Just having the US government (Medicare for all) make contracts for drugs at fixed prices would enable it to use its tremendous bargaining power to drastically lower   pharmaceutical costs. Since so many of the technological and   pharmaceutical developments are funded by or result from research funded   by US tax payers, we can impose requirements that drug makers charge   the US lower prices: the wealthy who own drug makers now profit from US   funding for research, without even reimbursing US tax payers for one   penny of their funding.    (We can also require that a portion of other patent profits derived from US government funding be paid over to the Medicare for All fund, which patent profits are now grabbed by   corporations after most of the research costs have been borne by the US   government: e.g., computers, semiconductors, genetic research, etc. Why   should the billionaire owners of technology companies continue to get   free rides?)    Medicare and Medicaid already dramatically limit medical costs by using their bargaining power (through tough negotiations) and thereby restrain participating doctors and hospitals   (now actually usually HMOs or working for) from profiteering by   constantly making increases in their charges charged Medicare or   Medicaid in excess of the inflation rate. With some engineering as   discussed above, it would be easy to fund Medicare for All and provide   decent medical care for all Americans.    Thus, instead of dealing with the real issues, HMOs, insurers, and their cronies, presstitutes,   and politistutes, prefer to lie, use deception, and just ridicule   Senator Warren. Healthcare costs are increasing at increasing rates; I   suspect that if Republicans win power again, Senator Warren\u2019s estimate   of heath care costs will not even be realistic. I predict that   healthcare costs will rise more if Medicare for all were defeated.    That is the key fact that they do not want Americans to realize. Many more   trillions and trillions of dollars will be cheated out of poor, hard   working Americans by the insurers, HMOs, and others, if the Republicans   or Republicrats win, particularly if they manage to repeal even the ACA,   which has still allowed huge increases in their profits. They have   bought our government, so they can do whatever they like. See   https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/05/the-quiet-coup/307364/.   That is why the US has the most ludicrously expensive, limited   (covering only a fraction of Americans) and inefficient healthcare   system in the world.\" ", "Norton Newmann": "\"\"\"But won't Medicare for All be very expensive and raise taxes?\"\"  Answer:    The current insurance based health system is quickly escalating to costing $5 trillion per year, and it doesn't even provide healthcare for all Americans. Medicare for All will cost significantly less and provide better healthcare for ALL Americans. The health insurance and pharma industries are using the fear tactic of telling people \"\"your taxes will go up\"\".      So let's lay this out: Through payroll deductions AND (hidden) employer contributions, it costs a person $7,500 per year in premiums. Then, using a typical 80/20 plan, they pay an additional 20% for their care - on top of the premiums they already paid! And we haven't even touched on the overpriced drugs this person ALSO must pay more out of pocket for. Or being limited to \"\"in network\"\" doctors and hospitals!      Let's assume with Medicare for All a person will pay (through taxes) $5,000 per year. BUT - they no longer have the payroll deduction of $7,500. It's all semantics - and corporate interests opposed to MCA know that.      A payroll deduction is a payroll deduction! Call it what you want. Bottom line is that the \"\"premium\"\" you pay now through payroll deduction is FAR more than the \"\"premium\"\" (tax) you would pay for MCA. But by using the scary word \"\"tax\"\" instills fear, where (I guess) the word \"\"premium\"\" does not? Go figure...      These media dopes make a living off of sound bites. Bernie really needs to create a succinct reply to this \"\"tax\"\" attack angle. Put it in simple, clear language (far better than me) the average working person can digest. There are some brilliant people working in the Bernie camp - I think this is key in putting the tax boogie man scare tactic to bed for good.\" ", "Dennis Skinner": "Under a medicare for all system.

And Medicare For All will save us more than $5 Trillion over ten years  which is a savings of more than $1 Billion every day.     It\u2019s not government run healthcare like the VA; it keeps doctors in control of their own care, so clinics and hospitals will continue to operate in the same way they already do. The only difference will be that they will save time and money by not having to file claims with different forms and argue over the phone with multiple insurance companies.     Hospitals will no longer have patients coming to the ER without insurance and people will no longer fear calling an ambulance more than they fear dying in their car on the way to the ER.

Bernie Sanders is essentially saying that he identifies with the moniker of social democracy and that democracy is the key factor but democracy for the people. The people were the social aspect of this social democracy label. He's not suggesting that political labels are the way to beat Donald Trump. His motivation is not to beat Donald Trump. his motivation is to give more to the people for what they put into the system already. He's smart enough and alert enough to see the discrepancy in the labeling of redistribution of wealth and socialism when it comes to the billionaire class. As he pointed out Wall Street has no problem with socialism as long as it benefits them the banking industry has no problem with socialism when it benefits them. Donald Trump's family didn't have a problem with socialism when socialism paid for their enormous wealth.and the elite class has no problem with redistribution of wealth when the taxpayer funds are spent on wars of aggression tax breaks for the wealthy and eminent domain that benefits corporations.Bernie Sanders is agenda is not to depose Trump it's the provide the country with more for what they put into the system. he wants to remind the people that the government is by the people of the people and for the people. And the people are not the top three families in this country they are all of the families in this country. Did the American citizens see a dime for the sale of weapons to Israel Iran or Saudi Arabia? did the American people even have a say in those transactions that took place. Did the American people get to vote on the bailouts? Absolutely not. You might say that the representatives that were voted into office spoke for the people but that would be untrue. And that's why Bernie Sanders resonates with the American people because he actually has a track record of following through with what it is that he says he stands for. People like your guess may want to minimize Bernie Sanders in the elite class within the political system may suggest that Bernie Sanders is ineffective  but the reality is at least he is pushing forwarding agenda that is consistent with what he stands for what he has stated he will do. Americans don't just give up because someone says it's not possible or because other stand against them. We fight and we continue to fight until we persevere. If our politicians in office did just a quarter of what Bernie Sanders has attempted to do this country would not be in the condition that it's in and the symptom of Donald Trump would never have come into office.\" ", "2019-06-15T05:48:15.000Z": "mohawk 47 Put the bottle down Bernie ", "2019-06-15T04:41:11.000Z": "aileenpi73 \"Democratic Socialism is what took us out of the Great Depression.

It was stated that Kamala Harris raised $12 million \"\"over the same time span\"\" as Bernie. Actually her campaign started January 21th nearly a month before Bernie's  which started February 19th. So Kamala's fundraising time for her $12 million was 70 days  while Bernie raised $18.2 million in only 41 days. I would've loved to have hear some specifics about Elizabeth Warren's campaign's fund raising totals. The only thing I've heard is she had only 8 000 donors her first day...I'm not sure if that was on the first day of her Exploratory Committee (December 31  2018) or her first day of her campaign launch (February 9th)... either way  it's far below Kamala's 38 000 first day donors and Bernie's 223 000 first day donors. Bernie is also for breaking up big corporations  and people know in a Sanders administration Warren will have a role in that. So people go for who's been consistent for decades and who is the whole progressive package: Bernie.   Pete Buttigieg announced his Exploratory Committee on January 23rd and has not officially announced so all this time, Pete can legally coordinate with PACs, which is shadier than Bernie and Kamala just straight up announcing their runs.  I'd love to know more details of where Pete's money comes from.   Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the latest media pushed candidate, despite Buttigieg being 7th place with 2.3% in the RCP averaging of 6 polls... his highest polling of the 6 was one poll gave him 4%. By comparison Warren's average is 5.7%, Kamala is 9.8% and Bernie is 21.8%.  The Wall Street Journal even wrote an article calling Pete Buttigieg \"\"Baby Bernie\"\" similar to articles in December calling Beto Bernie 2.0, yet neither Buttigieg nor Beto support Medicare for All, which media corporations hate Medicare for All because their businesses make a ton of money from the healthcare/insurance industry.    I even saw a well known supporter of Buttigieg admit Pete won't win, saying \"\"He won't get the nomination and he probably does not have enough experience, but in the primary, I am going to vote my heart, and then vote for whatever corporatist hack the Dems will surely nominate in the general - as per forever.\"\" So Buttigieg's supporters are fine with whoever in the general, even Republican-lite, but not everyone has the \"\"Vote blue no matter who\"\" mentality, and I'm seeing plenty of people saying they won't vote or won't vote Dem if the Dems nominate a corporatist. So we will end up with Trump again if we don't have a good nominee. We can't lie down and let that happen. Yet Buttigieg will peal away votes from more qualified candidates, making for a chaotic angst filled Convention.     The reasons I keep seeing people state for supporting Buttigieg are incredibly superficial: He's cute (some people found the Trojan Horse attractive and think how that worked out \ud83d\ude44), he's young (with age also comes useful experience... Besides there's other more qualified people his age who could or have run), Buttigieg wrote a book (so did most of the candidates running, and candidates typically don't write something that makes them look bad ... Well, with the exception of Hickenlooper and that movie he took his mom to \ud83d\ude2f), Buttigieg plays the piano (Billy Joel is the \"\"Piano Man\"\" but nobody thinks he should be President), Buttigieg talks nice (being a smooth-talker and using the vernacular of progressives is not a substitute for good policies), he's gay (so that checks that identity politics box, while he wavers on supporting LGBTQ, and again there's more qualified LGBTQ politicians who could run), and he speaks multiple languages (That's another 'fun fact' like the playing piano, Buttigieg would make a great translator, but he's applying for a different job. Besides, speaking multiple languages is only swoon-worthy in this county. In European countries and other parts of the world, it's an average Tuesday. My Swiss grandfather could speak 7 languages, but even if he had been born here, speaking multiple languages would not have made him automatically qualified to be President.) All this Buttigieg trivia tells voters nothing about what he will do for people or this country or the world since the President is one of the world leaders.     He is Mayor of a city which is 301st in population size of the cities in the US. Most of his city's voters are Republicans so Buttigieg being liked by Republicans isn't a selling point when he has conservative leanings. Dems and a lot of Independents have very different priorities than a lot of Republicans. This is Democratic primary. The city he's Mayor of has significant problems, which I'll get back to. Buttigieg says the left and center-left talk about policies too much and that we should talk more about philosophy and our values and religion would fall into that, and he'll get to policy specifics later (aka the Beto approach). The long standing complaint by voters is politicians spouting too many platitudes and not talking about policy specifics to help people. A large portion of this country can't afford a $500 emergency, and still a significant portion of this country can't afford a $100 emergency, so people in need aren't *that* interested in a candidate's philosophical or religious views. Ironically, the media is trying to sell Buttigieg to Progressives/Berners by reporting that in high school he wrote an essay praising Bernie Sanders. I read that essay, and it praised the fact that Bernie stands up boldly for what's right even when it's not popular or is mocked (like standing up for African Americans starting in the 1960s and even being only one of two white leaders supporting Jesse Jackson in his Presidential in the 1980s or speaking out in favor of LGBTQ rights in the 1970s, as well as authorizing Gay Pride Day and fighting housing decriminalization for LGBTQ as Mayor in the 1980s and fighting the anti-gay marriage bill DOMA in Congress in the 1990s, yet 30-something Buttigieg does not make bold stands for what's right, instead spouting vague platitudes, not being 'all in' on healthcare, he's pro-AIPAC, and went against the will of Indiana voters to use his Super Delegate status to votes for Hillary, even though Indiana went to Bernie in 2016. On CNN Buttigieg went on a tangent about needing to refocus the discussion on the \"\"religious left.\"\" Putting aside the importance of separation of church and state, he's not for Medicare for All and takes the name of this hugely popular policy and bastardizes it into 'Medicare for All who want it public option buy in,' so how does letting people die because they can't afford to buy in fit with his Christian beliefs? He is against free college, like Klobuchar, Yang, etc. He's open to taking corporate money and is having a swanky Broadway fundraiser where the wealthy and bundlers will likely attend (similar to the swanky Hollywood fundraiser JJ Abrams had for Kamala Harris). Buttigieg calls boycotting (like with a homophobic restaurant) \"\"virtual signaling,\"\" and such \"\"political\"\" things should be left up to the government, so for the people who support him because he represents the LGBTQ community because he's gay, he is also dismissing the voices of LGBTQ people and their allies for exercising their right to not spend THEIR MONEY at a restaurant chain that known to be bigoted towards the LGBTQ community. He doesn't want to protect whistleblowers. Public safety depends on businesses and government being held accountable, and whistleblowers are vital to that. The city of 102,000 that he's run since 2011 has a bad poverty rate, racial income disparities and a high crime rate. He sells himself via the talking point that running a city is like running a small country, but the US already has enough problems and an inexperienced President, so we don't need Mayor Pete Buttigieg to do to the US what he did to South Bend, Indiana. There's just too much work to be done, and our lives and our children's lives literally depend on getting the next election right.\" ", "2019-04-07T06:36:56.000Z": "D Dcass Bernie 2020!!

The rest of his family was killed by Hitler a 'national' SOCIALIST at the beginning , like him. His Family was exterminated during the 'Holocaust'. Never trust those socialists, tendency to become dictators...Democratic ?, pretending is NOT the same as being one... We all know that Hitler used the 'national' SOCIALIST name to trick simple-minded patriotic people, never mind that he became a fascist criminal, that's not the issue. The trick apparently it's still working on a few people.  \u3000  Bernie Sanders leans left and liberal on many issues. He supports open borders, more Muslim communities, higher taxes, more government regulations and more welfare for the poor. Then again, so does his brother, Larry Sanders, who has run many times to head up the unsuccessful and controversial Green Party in the UK. He is a career politician that got absolutely nothing done in his name except get his home state free heating oil from a fellow communist Hugo Chaves back in 2003  \u3000  Seems like Bernie is a record-breaker on a few counts. He is the longest-serving member of the U.S. House of Representatives, ever. Therefore part of the Washington Establishment. Bernie has been around the block alright, having served eight useless consecutive terms in the U.S. House of representatives from 1991 to 2007. But don't ever ask him what he accomplished, he will always tell you to f*ck off !  \u3000  In 1963, Bernie was arrested while staging a fake civil rights sit-in. Recently posted footage by documentary company Kartemquin Films shows Sanders, then an unemployed misfit radical 21-year-old University of Chicago student, grabbed by police and hauled off to a police wagon. He did not want to serve his country in Vietnam either, not very patriotic. To all the hardworking American\u2019s and our Fathers, Mothers, Sons and Daughters who served in the Greatest Armed Forces in the World, Thank You for your Services and for keeping America Great.      To all the Draft Dodgers like Bernie Sanders who refused to step up to the plate when our country called, where were you when we needed you? COWARDS. Bernie Sanders is a MUGWUMP. Most people don't trust mugwumps and would never vote for one. What kind of idiot would ever vote for a mugwump. Sanders also was a writer for a Porn magazine in the 1970's contributing to the moral decadence of society but he very conveniently hides that fact.  \u3000   Kibbutzim are left-leaning radical isolated weird communities in Israel, traditionally based on agriculture, that are based on principles of social justice, equality for the mental incapacitated. Being that Bernie Sanders is Jewish, he stayed on a Kibbutz in Israel in his youth for 6 months in the 1960s, to avoid the military draft and find a good comparable mate.  \u3000  Between that low IQ, mentally retarded Biden and the old fart socialist fart Bernie, you just have to shake your head and wonder why anyone with any common sense would vote for either of these two misfits! Bernie is the most untrustworthy person running, and the biggest liar around.   \u3000  Bernie, is a guy who has spent most of his life sitting on his butt and accomplishing nothing but hating what anyone else has accomplished. So he thinks by taking away from those who have accomplished something by working hard, and giving it to those that are like him, who sit on their butts and do nothing but whine, he is a hero to some!   \u3000  Bernie Sanders was a bum who didn\u2019t earn a steady paycheck until he was 40 years old !. He was a slob who lived in a shack with a dirt floor. He later wrote about masturbation and rape for left-wing rags for $50 a story. The Socialist then wormed his way into politics. Bernie had his electricity cut off a lot so he\u2019d run an extension cord down to the basement. He couldn\u2019t pay his bills, and today he\u2019s running for president so he can take your money and redistribute it. ! Bernie was once kicked out of a social commune. He tried to join but after a few days they caught on that he didn't like to do any work so they asked him to leave.       Sanders spent most of his life as an angry misfit lonely radical and agitator who never accomplished much of anything and had no influential connection. And yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances \u2014 \"\"We will raise taxes;\"\" he confirmed Monday, \"\"yes, we will.\"\"  \u3000  One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps, and it was all downhill from there.  \u3000  Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail. \"\"He was a shi**y carpenter,\"\" a friend told Politico Magazine. \"\"His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn\u2019t.\"\" Notable Quote : \"\"\u00a0 Let's send Sanders to Moscow it's where he spent his honeymoon \"\" -- 'Lisa'  \u3000  Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about \"\"masturbation and rape\"\" and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was \"\"always poor\"\" and his \"\"electricity was turned off a lot.\"\" They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment \u2014 and this is what his friends had to say about him.  \u3000  The only thing Bernie Sanders was good at was talking \u2026 non-stop \u2026 about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off. \"\"The whole quality of life in America is based on greed,\"\" the bitter lay about said. \"\"I believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation.\"\" Misrepresentations and distortions of others is his specialty skill set  \u3000  So he tried politics, starting his own socialist party. Four times he ran for Vermont public office, and four times he lost \u2014 badly. He never attracted more than single-digit support \u2014 even in the People\u2019s Republic of Vermont. In his 1971 bid for U.S. Senate, the local press said the 30-year-old \"\"Sanders describes himself as a carpenter who has worked with \u2018disturbed children.\u2019 \"\" In other words, a real winner.  \u3000  He finally wormed his way into the Senate in 2006, where he still ranks as one of the poorest members of Congress. Save for a municipal pension, Sanders lists no assets in his name. All the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife\u2019s. He does, however, have as much as $65,000 in credit-card debt.  \u3000  Sure, Sanders may not be a hypocrite, but this is nothing to brag about. His worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other \"\"outsiders\"\" in the race for the White House, including a billionaire developer, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a Fortune 500 CEO.  \u3000  Lets see...Bernie spouts off that his Dad migrated from Poland to America so he could live the American dream...then Bernie dedicates his life to turning America into Poland. Bernie calls himself a Washington outsider, when the ONLY job he has ever had is as an elected official. Bernie wants to show empathy for the working man, when he has never EVER been a working man. Bernie wants to talk about democracy, and then hires others to blockade the rallies of his opponent...the true act of a socialist ( Meaning the people should not tolerate the candidate I don't like). And now Bernie is a New Yorker. Hmmm....  \u3000  In summary : Bernie Sanders is nothing but a BS 74 years old Socialist, borderline communist 'Conscientious Objector Pacifist' (a.k.a. COWARD ) No senate bills in 30 years being a Senator?? Free this and free that with NO coherent plan to pay for his freebie Cons. Personal attacks showing first stages of dementia(old age) Bernie supporters are looking for a bailout of their student loans...That's the only reason he has support...Even if elected, he couldn't get the legislation through...But kids will be kids....  \u3000  In a leaked audio, Crooked Hillary mocked the millions of Americans who proudly voted for Bernie Sanders, calling them basement-dwellers and hopeless.        This comes just weeks after Hillary told donors at a closed-door fundraiser that tens of millions of patriotic men and women are deplorable, irredeemable, and un-American.  \u3000  It is pretty simple principal. The United States has been so prosperous because government has largely stayed out of business and allowed free markets to flourish. Other countries which have more government control have fewer investors, little entrepreneurship, and less prosperity.        The degree to which government stays out of business interests is directly proportional to the prosperity of it's citizens. Venezuela today is the poster child of Bernie Sanders & Alex Cortez and the Bolshevik's 'DemocRATic Socialism'.  \u3000  Bernie Sanders still considers Maduro to be the rightful leader of Venezuela. He won't call him a dictator and won't refer to Guaido as the President of Venezuela.

And Yang\u2019s plan is the one that\u2019s actually most similar to Denmark\u2019s system  and also very similar to Australia\u2019s- some of the best healthcare in the world.

Pass all the laws you want criminal do not follow the law. Ask people living in countries like Mexico where guns are almost impossible to buy.

Did you listen to all that he had to say?    For all the christians out there who are having second thoughts because of Bernie's supposed \"\"atheism\"\" even though he has stated in the past that he isn't, I would like you all to consider this point.  I'm not trying to be condescending or disrespectful in anyway, shape or form. I'm simply asking to consider the point made.     What is God's moral law? I know that some christians don't even know what that is. God's moral law are the Ten Commandments. You can find them in the book of Exodus, chapter 20. I once heard this pastor say that when government starts to violate commandments 5-10, we the governed will be in trouble. I couldn't agree more. Why? First, the government's principle job is the protection of its citizens. Second, commandments 5-10 has to do with your duty to your fellow man. So when the government fulfills its principle duty, it fulfills commandments 5-10.    Let's just say you feel Sen. Bernie Sanders is an atheist and as president he implements those substantive policies he's fought for for the middle and lower middle classes and the very poor. It will just go to show that atheists can have morals as well since it's borrowed from God (whether Bernie believes it or not). That's because we are made in the image of God which means we are to have the character of God. With that said, morality is something that is inherit in us all because it was meant to be understood (provided there's no mental retardation...no pun intended). Can you understand what Sen. Sanders is trying to do? Is he doing evil or is he fighting for a good thing for society?    I know...what about commandments 1-4? Well, it has to do with our duty to God. God gives us free will. There's nothing we can do about the choices people make. No one in the universe should force you to believe in commandments 1-4.\u00a0However, It doesn't mean you can't be lead to it...it's making a personal decision for Christ (Christ is both the great law and life Giver). People can only make that choice individually...in their hearts (and that's through the Word...upon the conviction of the Holy Spirit). If God gives us the freedom to decide, who is anybody to take it away? Please understand that I am not encouraging atheism here. I am only emphasizing the truth that we are \"\"free to decide\"\" because God wills it and we are to respect it. And at the same time, God also wills that everybody decides truthfully according to Scripture.    If Sen. Sanders is fighting for something good in society, why wouldn't you separate \"\"religion\"\" (if you know what I mean by religion) from doing something good and solely allow God later on to make a judgment humans are not qualified to make? Judge Sanders for the good he is fighting for and not by \"\"religion.\"\"    Remember the speech Sen. Sanders gave four years ago at Liberty University? Wouldn't you say it was pretty bold of him to do so? He faced all those people.

I\u2019m not worried because I have faith in the people around me here tonight.  I\u2019m not worried because these are the people that educate our children; who make certain their travel to and from school is safe. They grow the foods we can\u2019t live without...and work through the night so that those foods fill the isles we stroll the next day. They clean and groom the parks you and your children play in...and they dig the ditches that steer clean water to you - and to the firefighters that answer the call when your neighbors house is consumed in flame.  They staff\u00a0our hospitals and emergency rooms. And they burn the midnight oil - buried in the pages of books...slumped over in laboratories driven to discover the \u201cnext cure.\u201d They patch the potholes and they plow the snow. They raise the flags...and they pay the toll.  We\u2019re being tested Bernie. We\u2019re being tested to see if we really are ready to take back control in our lives: to take back control in our democracy and our government.  And I believe that you are showing us that yes, we are ready.  From the very beginning Bernie, I have always believed that your job is twofold:  1. To empower authority back to the people  ...and  2. To convince \u201cus\u201d to except it.  Bernie, I don\u2019t believe in \u201cUniversal Band-Aid Income.\u201c And I don\u2019t believe in endless \u201cplans\u201c that simply empower bureaucrats and technocrats more than they empower\u00a0me\u00a0or\u00a0my fellow Americans.  I believe in me, Bernie. I believe in you, and I believe in all the people in this room tonight. And I believe that\u00a0all\u00a0Americans are finally...finally\u00a0ready to get our priorities right in this country.  We\u2019ve got work to do Bernie...lots and lots of work to do; with millions upon millions of jobs and entrepreneurs just waiting for their day in the sun. Because that\u2019s what human beings enjoy, Bernie. And while it\u2019s true that we thrive when we are being\u00a0productive,\u00a0our\u00a0most important need of all\u00a0- is having the chance to create real self-worth in our lives.  So today Bernie, I earnestly believe we are ready to get to work.

Abstract  We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991\u20132011 matching the topics \u2018global climate change\u2019 or \u2018global warming\u2019. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors\u2019 self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time.

The post DLC Dems abandoned the poor and working class and fell in love with the professional class - the 'creative class'  with fancy pedigrees and Yale / Harvard degrees. The problem is these people are usually biased by the underlying ethos or narrative of their specialized background and are thus not usually 'out of the box' problem solvers; they tend to gravitate (and defer to) people with a similar background (and ignore the needs and desires of average Americans); they love complexity for complexity's sake and they are risk averse - I.E. they scoff at bold ideas and policies. They are the Serious People (and everyone else is crazy.. like the media portrays Bernie without trying to understand what he is trying to do). This is the legacy of Bill Clinton (triangulation  deregulation  overturning Glass Steagall) and Obama ('you can only turn the ship of state maybe 2 degrees'; Dodd Frank: a 22 000 page bill of banking regulations intended as a replacement for Glass Steagall  with plenty of loopholes  exceptions  etc.). Not that Warren is just like Clinton or Obama  but the same tendencies exist in her policies AND with her supporters. Be bold with Wall Street (her big legacy) and tweak around the edges on other issues.. but transformative change? We desperately need it  but it doesn't seem to come natural to her. Worse  by taking big money in the general election  what message will that send to the progressive base? How indebted will she feel? Can she resist the pressures that come with those donations (people expect a return on investment).. And if she did become POTUS  she would likely run again in 2024; how will she raise money for that race? How much compromise and cosying up will that engender? And will Warren use the bully pulpit and rally people to pressure corporate congress to pass any of her legislative agenda like Bernie proposes? If not  how will she get anything done? Then there is electability. Warren has three disadvantages there: 1) The DNA fiasco. Trump will beat her over the head with that and make her look phony. 2) Her taking Big Money donations in the general election (something he used in 2016 with great effect: 'I know how the system works; these guys come into my office begging for a check and I write it..' - I.E. the implication of corruption). 3) Her 'professorial' delivery. Less educated blue collar voters (think the rust belt) have been conditioned to think that Dems tend to talk down to them  to be condescending  to tell them to 'eat their peas' (there is a grain of truth in this narrative  even if it is mostly born of propaganda by the Fox crowd). This makes them feel like those liberal snobs are attacking their own sense of self worth. Warren reeks of this. It doesn't bother me and I am sure it doesn't bother the Hamptons crowd  but it will bother the critical voters required to win the general election. The surest bet to win in 2020 AND transform DC politics so it works for the people again is an authentic populist with receipts.

In fact   their measure will discourage business investments and accumulation of capital  which in turn will shrink the economy and stunt job growth.    Yes you do get extra welfare items like free medical and free college education.  Those are social safety net and enhancement programmes.  But they are not economic growth engines.  And they should not be paid through taxing people.  Once those programmes become entitlements  when revenue fall short during economic downturns  everybody is on the hook to pay extra tax to keep the programmes going  not just the rich.  I am really worried about the tendency in these politicians who  in order to gain popular support  are pitching one income class against another under the disguise of \"\"equality in income\"\"  \"\"injustice\"\" and \"\"redistribution by force\"\".

The first flips towns off-grid, its magnet motor for 1300hp/1-Mw is small, 24x7in/61x17cm, fits -=> cars, trucks, tractors, trains, aeroplanes and ships at sea.    This implies cars without refueling or recharging for the LIFETIME of the owner, eh?    The 1300hp/1-Mw has a half-century warranty of 24/7 power with normal upkeep, the magnets are still 90% in 1000-years, it's the only sensible power source to pursue.    So, flip towns off-grid, 1-Mw/1300hp, \"\"50-year no-inputs warranty\"\"; 17yr R&D; Belgian: technokontrol.com/en/current-projects/generator.php, the RF-5000, sparkless for use with explosives, military-spec, ships in a container.

Korean: infinitysav.com/magneticgenerator    The 5kw fits a pickup toolbox, is quiet, no fumes indoors, looks good for construction to me, $35/month + interest for 24x7 power, eh?    These globally are the ONLY machines ready for assembly-line, high-volume design and production I found in trade studies, you try.    They are a bleeding edge, beaten path to a near zero-emission, tiny carbon-footprint motive power for all machines.    SECOND, is using algae to purify wastewater at the treatment plant, or onsite for home\u2022farm\u2022ranch using the same units, this emits O2 and removes CO2, eh?    Then, the oils & biomass can become biodiesel and derivatives, from a pilot study I did for Phoenix, AZ, a 10M-gallon/day plant can produce about 3M-gallon/day of biodiesel, Gov. Jan Brewer and her EPA head were on board, we got shot down by her party, the GOP in the USA.    Too bad, eh? Sound familiar?    THIRD: Have ALL IC-Engine mfg's make replacements with N.Tesla Tailpipes, a one-way air valve with no moving parts that nearly ZEROES emissions for their tailpipes.    If they won't, shut them down, this eliminates soot from biodiesel, can be scaled up to industrial smokestacks, it reduces back-pressure, improves performance.    And, he tied it to IC-Engines for this purpose 80yrs ago, eh?    FOURTH: It all boils down to dealing with Arctic seaice, HEAT GAINED in the 2007 retreat was 95,000-Twh over average.    Closing all Steam-age power plants 250Mwh and above is a one-time save of 36,000-Twh in emitted wasteheat.    That's 2\u20221/2-times too little to balance the gain vs the loss compared to the 1980-2000 average ice extent.    Losing the seaice is game-over on controlling runaway in the Arctic, this is what brings the extremes in weather vs assuming it'd get tropical to midwest farmers, eh?    Also, the Arctic Ocean is at the aragonite saturation point, all that a local marine biologist saw flying over the newly opened water were jellyfish, millions of them.    There is no fishery there as it becomes open water.    The serious 'Last Hurrah' for it all, to me, for what humanity needs to do:     Install a weir dam at St. Lawrence Is. and polder north the entire Chukchi Sea to prevent wave damage and stratify the water to refreeze the bottom creating a year-round seaice refuge.    ALL shipping confined within 3-4km of shore, zero cross-ocean traffic, this uses Dutch ships, materials and methods to create polders, shoals & levees.     And, building submerged \"\"atolls\"\" encircling\u00a0 methane vents, this uses the bubble flow to pull in colder bottom water which refreezes them.    It all confines the freshwater runoff and most of all limits early melting from shore out to-sea in spring.    This reduces 5-Amazons of warmer, fresher water to 1/100th of what is melting the seaice from below.    Fresher water freezes at a higher temperature so true seaice isn't formed at the surface on freezeup, it needs -2C/28.4F for seaice to last over ONE season.    This intends to prevent the Siberian jetstream from turning north and can be modelled, the N.Pacific is too warm and heats the airmass from below, with The Blob in the Gulf of AK, that drives the circulation pattern needing change back to Holocene patterns.    So, the warmth sends rain to Anchorage in December and frozen oranges to Florida the routine now, started early, eh?    As that air cools it now gets to low latitudes ONLY over LAND to balance equatorial overheating.    The concept has 36,000 views on a seaice forum and zero actions upon it.    It's the only geographic location on Earth with the ability to alter the Anthropocene jetstream paths back into N.America instead of going north.    I can't order it done, the people in the poop deck party think everything's fine with lifeboats already in the water ...    In any case, it's the ONLY sane try to alter things not dependent upon emissions to overcome those effects enough to give MIDWEST FARMERS a break, else, expect a repeat of this past year or worse, eh?     Expect flooding after this early snow, cold ground for maximum runoff vs a normal Holocene year, or worse, it stays cold.    Welcome to the Anthropocene, CO2 won't go below 400ppm for >>120,000-years as oceans outgas their aragonite losses by reversing the carbonic acid cycle which acidifies fast and goes alkaline very, very slowly , a bio\u2022geochemical hysteresis, a real reason to consider extinction with business-as-usual.    \"\"The rate of acidification is 10-times faster or more than anything we have seen for the past 50-million years and perhaps over the last 300-million years.\"\".\u00a0 ICES ASC 2013 Plenary Lecture;  Dr Richard Feely, 9:10 into 1:01:08; 14:30 in CO2 vertical maps; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etFob9Wy45E    Very sensible and comprehensive of relevant fundamentals; \"\"Global Warming 56 Million Years Ago: What it Means for Us\"\";   Dr. Scott Wing, Smithsonian Museum of Nat' History; 1:44:14; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81Zb0pJa3Hg, [Temp chart duration: Solomon et al., 2009, PNAS]    Modelling climate, what a \"\"carbon excursion\"\" is to paleontology, 1st part awards, great talk, illuminating: We are too close to the total carbon of the PETM, about 3\u2022parts per mil.

I wanted to vote for him in 2020. Here is why I am reconsidering. Cenk Uygur  former Republican turned Progressive of The Young Turks  has the type of controversial past you would expect of almost any former Republican. Heck  I used to be a Fox News watching  right wing Christian fundamentalist. Now I\u2019m ashamed of all that nonsense. Of course if you dig into his conservative past\u2014that has nothing to do with his current convictions\u2014 you will find dirt. You can find dirt on anyone. Back when  like many of us  he was on the wrong side of history  it I was expected that he parrot some of the rhetoric and attitudes that most define central aspects of the GOP  including comments that come across as xenophobic and sexists. But for far more years Cenk has denounced that misguided way of thinking and fought hard for the very opposite. Anyone familiar with TYT knows where they stand. They are unequivocally Progressive. That is why this smear campaign by the Democrats against Cenk is so repulsive and reminiscent of the tactics used by Trumpists. Establishment Dems are terrified of progressives and will literally lie to destroy them. Until recently I thought Bernie Sanders was not part of the establishment. His previous endorsement of Cenk made perfect sense  as Cenk is metonymically the future. Then Bernie un-endorsed Cenk and  consequently  added his stamp of approval to the lie-based character assassination of one of the most outspoken progressives of our time. So will I be voting for someone like Bernie who can be so easily bought and who  like Trump  is so quick to throw people under the bus just to get ahead politically? That is not the Bernie I know. I don\u2019t want to believe that about him but now I am forced to consider that he may not be the best choice for presidential candidate. I\u2019m giving Bernie Sanders one month to stand on the right side of this smear campaign and defend truth and justice.

So from child care to school choice to paid family leave, the Trump Administration is putting parents back in control. \u00a0    \ud83c\udfac\u00a0Watch:\u00a0President Trump is putting control back into parents\u2019 hands!    Today, President Trump\u00a0and Ivanka Trump hosted a White House Summit on Child Care and Paid Family Leave. \u201cOur goal is simple,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe want to expand child care options and reduce unnecessary regulations so that parents can choose the best care for their children, including, and very importantly, in-home and faith-based care.\u201d    After all,\u00a0how families balance work and raising children is a deeply personal choice. Government\u2019s mission should be to support parents as they make the best decision possible for their families, not to dictate a one-size-fits-all \u201csolution\u201d for every household.    That support\u00a0begins with access to quality child care, both from safe providers and from parents themselves. \u201cIn more than 60 percent of American homes, both parents work,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cYet many struggle to afford child care, which often costs more than $10,000 per year. And it\u2019s devastating to families, frankly. Devastating.\u201d    Help is on the way.\u00a0In his State of the Union Address this February, President Trump called for Congress to pass paid family leave into law. One week ago, legislators introduced \u201cvery strong bipartisan legislation, Paid Family Leave legislation,\u201d the President said today. \u201cWe were thrilled.\u201d    This kind of support\u00a0for working families has defined the Trump Administration\u2019s economic and social agenda since day one:    The President signed legislation last year securing historic funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which helps low-income families access quality child care programs.  \u00a0    The Trump tax cuts included a new tax credit that incentivizes companies to offer paid family leave to their employees.  \u00a0    The Administration worked with Congress to secure paid parental leave for all Federal employees as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.  \u00a0    The President\u2019s tax cuts also\u00a0doubled\u00a0the child tax credit, benefitting more than 40 million American families with an average of over $2,200 apiece this year.\" ", "tsafa": "\"\u201d Your children\u2019s children will live under communism.\u00a0You Americans are so gullible.

Economists warn that a prolonged trade dispute between the world's two largest economies is elevating risks to the global economy by disrupting supply chains, curtailing investment and curbing business confidence.    Completion of a phase one deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House have told Reuters, with Beijing asking for more extensive tariff rollbacks and Washington countering with increased demands of its own.    \"\"We want to work for a 'phase one' agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality,\"\" Xi told representatives of an international forum, according to a pool report.    \"\"When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war. We did not initiate this trade war and this is not something we want,\"\" he said.    Xi was responding to questions from representatives of the New Economy Forum organized by Bloomberg LP at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.    China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources. It also said Beijing hoped the talks could take place before next Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.    U.S. officials have indicated they would be willing to meet in person but have not committed to a date, the report said, and they would be reluctant to travel for the discussions unless China made it clear it would make commitments on intellectual property protection, forced technology transfers and agricultural purchases.    Officials from Beijing had suggested Xi and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump might sign a deal in early December.    Some experts said the next date to watch was Dec. 15, when U.S. tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect, including holiday gift items such as electronics and Christmas decorations.    \"\"As we always said we don't want to start the trade war but we are not afraid,\"\" Xi said.\" ", "Kiss Thunderstrike": "\"I'd be worried if Bernie becomes president  he might just die in his first term (he's 78!).\" ", "Avery Butler": "\"With the current administration in place I feel as if the American people politically are pitted against eachother. The world is and will forever will be a changing place  because humans  in the most simplest explanation  are bipedals with changing opinions  creatures of habit. Bernie Sanders has it right on the money  he has been saying this since the 80s that there needs to be change in growing with the times  and that we need to start looking after citizens not our deep rooted traditions. Traditions themselves is what keeps the \u201cSpirit\u201d of America alive  but what if the gun violence drops dramatically because we get better child devlopment care which doesn\u2019t put out 12-18 year olds on anti-depressants and anti-pyschoic pills. Veterans return home to a country that forgets them  and goes to the VA where they are perscibed pills. These deep seeded traditions of greed  and pride interwoven into our society need to be duely nipped in the bud. Where I personally start to get frustrated with Bernie  and this maybe due to lack of research on my part  (which i expect the following comments to clear up any lack of information) is that the average American is required to work hard for a living. What Sen. Sanders is proposing would give Americans one less thing they would have to worry about. Democratic Socialism  according to Bernie Sanders  is Government funded healthcare  government funded higher education  and a better quality of education for generations to come. The government  especially the executive office  is not an omnipotent  irreproachable entity. It is an American citizen that lives in a building that has doors  doors that are shut off to the public but reseved for lawyers  lawmakers  and other foreign leaders. The 2020 election will not be a 12 round Bernie v. Trump match  Bernie has to make his campaign a revolution. To bring our collective of people  maybe communities and even cities together to go back to our unalienable rights endowed by our Creator. This comment is meant to make people think. If the citizens of this country Bernie Sanders as their next president  its the time to roll up your sleeves and seriously talk about why we need the current administration to hold power is it because it makes \u201clibtards\u201d angry  or is it I feel that my voice is being heard. Americans are not statistics that are to be flaunted in social media.      (ill dislike my own comment due to gun tangent lol).

So Sanders stepped up (coordinating with Warren cost him some valuable time ! he announced at the end of April 2015). Sanders and Jeff Weaver planned a grassroots campaign with 30 million dollars, no one - including them - thought that they had a shot at winning. (never mind their assertions, of course they did not openly state that). Sanders wanted to use the platform to draw attention to important issues (single payer healthcare, student loan debt, minimum wage, regulation the too big to fail banks) and he wanted to set an example that it is possible to run a robust campaign w/o big corporate donations.     Warren could be president now !   If she had adopted an unwavering ! pro single payer stance  ! - I think Sanders would have enthusiastically campaigned for her already in the primaries. HE would have endorse her right away (damned be the party machine). Together they could really have chased HRC - and Trump in the GE. I do not even think that Sanders would have demanded a cabinet position in exchange for his endorsement and support. Outreach / Coordinator for single payer maybe - but he adopted that  role on his own while remaining Senator for VT after the Nov. 2016 election.     back to the \"\"debate\"\" of Jan. 2020:  Senator did you say to Elizabeth Warren that a woman cannot win the presidency ?  Sanders: No ! (Makes his arguments: I asked Warren to run in 2015 and would have defered to her. HRC won the propular vote by 3 million how could anyone believe a woman cannot win .... )  Interviewer: Just to wrap this up: You never said to E.W. that a woman cannot win the presidency ?  Sanders: No.    Interviewer turns to Elizabeth Warren: Senator Warren how did you feel when Senator Sanders said to you that a woman cannot win the presidency ?    Some in the audience burst into a surprised laugh. It was ridiculuos (Senator Sanders: When did you stop beating your wife ?).    Questions worthy of a _journalist:_   We have two very different accounts what was said in that meeting. Sen. Warren, can you give us more details, or is it possible that there has been a misunderstanding....    Sanders stated that he commented on Trump in that meeting with Warren in Dec. 2018. That he is a racist, sexist, bigot ... who will exploit everything - incl. gender - to go after the Democratic nominee - so it is possible that he said something w/o bad intentions that Warren perceived as offensive or condescending.  (Cenk has \"\"sources\"\" that CNN has been working for months on a narrative angle to smear Sanders being a \"\"sexist\"\" - and NOW that he took the lead in some Iowa polls it was time to unleash the campaign).     Sanders is right that Trump will play dirty - and Warren happens to be ill equipped to stand up to such attacks in my opinion. Has nothing to do with professional qualification. Which are not enough to win the presidency.    She would need to have a spine (oops !) and not be wobbly about key issues. And she would need to know when to react and which battles NOT fo fight. Warren let herself be baited by Trump into the DNA video regarding her native ancestry.    Not a big deal (it is not going to break her candidacy) BUT it reveals some flaws that DO make her a bad fit to go against Trump.    WHO thought it was a good idea to publish DNA results when they show that she has LESS matching DNA than the average American ? Not only was that foolish and also showed poor political instincts (being triggered by Trump's \"\"Pocahontas\"\" attacks - if THAT is the worst the right wingers can find out about her, she is fine, no need to lean into THEIR narrative. Chose your battles and chose the location of your battles. Trump would love to engage her in the silly \"\"Pocahontas\"\" controversy - but who says she has to play along with it ?).    She also offended the First Nations while she was at it. Ancestry as they define it is NOT proven by DNA testing - and she could not be bothered to consult with them before she published the DNA video.    Never mind that she declared herself to be Native American back in the day w/o any connection to the First Nations and w/o doing any research (other than a vague family story, which might be easily fiction. It seems many families have such a romanticized tale - and more often than not it is not true if they do the research).    Well back in the day people were less sensitive about cultural appropriation - but she hasn't evolved on the issue. Native American councils called her out when the DNA video was published (politely, but they made clear that it was offensive). I think she did not profit personally from identifying as Native American, but that it was a little vain - and in Harvard likely doing her employer favors (they had a token minority among staff, which actually was from white middle class background. Her family was solidly middle class before her father got sick).    If my assumption is correct - it is not the worst thing ever, but it means that a genuine minority applicant might have missed out on a chance to be employed by Harvard. Warren likely helped them sugarcoat their diversity record.    Several tribes organized the resistance against DAPL - Warren did not support the water protectors. At that time (summer / fall 2016)  it seemed likely that HRC would win the presidency and Warren was still angling for a cabinet position. So damned be considerations of pipelines for exporting ! crude oil that WILL eventually leak and jeopardize the water source for millions (the Missouri). The party / the Clinton machine would not have liked Warren to alienate the donors of Big Finance and the fossil fuel industry.    Methinks Warren just isn't progressive presidential material. Able and willing to bring about \"\"big structural change\"\". And the last controversy she started about the \"\"sexism\"\" of Sanders makes her look not only weak in certain aspects but outright calculating, ruthless,  and disingenuous. Plus being under the influence of clueless advisors (allegedly she has a lot of former Clinton / Obma staffers).     With that DNA video she proved that she STILL didn't get it. In this day and age you do not call yourself a Native American (or justify that you self-identified as such in the past) if you have never lived in the communities, lived the culture, and without Native relatives or documented ancestry.    DNA does not make the Native American ** - it is a cultural / spiritual / societal connection (Sanders and Gabbard never claimed ancestry - but they came out in support of the Water Protectors nontheless).    ** The tribes occasionally accepted white people, black slaves, pepole from Latin America and other foreigners into their communities. (there are cases where they kidnapped children of settlers,to raise them as their own).     To make things worse, a few months ago she gave an interview to Charlemagne the God (black radio). She did not expect detailled questions on policy or any hard hitting questions. It was a lifestyle interview if you will. He asked her When have you realized that you do not have Native ancestors ?    She started a word salad (Not answering his question, but tap dancing around the issue. \"\"Look, ....\"\" ). In other words: she knows that Trump will bring this up if she becomes the nominee, but for now she very carefully controls which interviews she gives - only in \"\"friendly territory\"\" (she also does not go on FOX News). So she STILL did not have her soundbites ready - likely she did not expect to be asked such invconvenient questions during the primary season.    The interviewer had mercy and did not press her anymore (or point out that she was deflecting and had not answered his question). Even w/o the recent disingenuous action (Sanders told me I cannot become president - I am almost certain he did not say it in _that_ manner, nor did he mean it _that_ way) - Trump would run circles around her, she does not have the flexibility to react to questions she perceives as \"\"challenging\"\".     She took offense when Amy Goodman asked her a legitimate question, a snappy short exchange followed (Goodman remained polite) and then Warren left the stage, she shook the hand of the other person on the stage, but refused to shake the hand of Amy Goodman when she wanted to thank her for the interview.      If she cannot even deal with Amy Goodman (who is progressive, polite, factual, nuanced and does not do gotcha journalism) - good luck in the GE with the rightwingers.\" ", "2020-01-15T20:19:13.000Z": "Xyz Same \"AOC and Sanders were cute and gave great answers - but the inteviewer !!   9:05 If you (cynical / incredulous smile) would win the presidency could AOC play a role in your cabinet ....  - That interviewer has voice fry.

No, this proves you,  Bernie Sanders are  the worst kind of opponent as you can not see your enemies are good men, you refuse to trust in the common goodness of all men, you refuse to see your opponents for who they are,       So I say Bernie your the perfect politician to keep this nation divided forever and that is the only way this nation shall fall,  as you simply can't love your enemies as nothing else can end opposition as there is a time for any ideal to progress as the times do change to elect the right party to the right time, but no one can know this apart from those who are true peacemakers and those kind of men  see those who oppose them as having virtues of lawful character holdings onto ideals that differ for sure, but with such willingness to see any ideals goodness then so may such a person show his own opposing ideals as goodness as it is a matter of when an ideal is best for a nation as no ideal can always hold a candle before the change of time, only one who could first see your enemy as good men could also love them.     For who divides as Bernie does shall defame good men and alienate a nation of people to make the politics of war that says they must first have enemies having faith ideals corrupt men simply that their ideals are not your ideals, instead of respecting the common goodness in your enemies that are found within your self.    Where a great man would  command the ideals of all men by unifying them having no need of the war machine which first must have faith the principles of men in all parties are at least redeemable , where commonalities are seen in respect of each other as any parties views will never stand the test of time as they must all fail in certain times as the ideals of any men work together having each a fitting time.    For actions of those ideals to come to rise to pass in accordance to expecations and if we forfit some ideals then those ideals will not be there in there own due time and so what is best for the nation shall not even be seen before the conceit.     The natural order of democracy exists in this service already as the conceit that deny set of ideal or it's party for that matter denies the proof democracy elects opposing parties against your own conceit as the dictatorship of its own way exalted above the any set of ideals manifest way before the time of it's choosing to the greatest good as democracy her self has no conceit to exclude any to be so elected in service of the nation led by it's own time to prefer one set of ideals over another as see how your conceit has already denied democracy's perfect way!     As to a peacemaker view is to all human ideals held to a good esteem of actions in a  political warfare where understanding your opponents ensures you are more likely to defeat them seeing them as  good men that are  lawful and moved by the belief of what best serves the nation being acted out where each holding the same profound belief held to each  a set of ideals.     The respect you have for your opponent's opinion proves you could at least see the truth, as any Peacemakers sees that at least a leader of a nation must understand any duration of lasting time has contrasting moments that each thrust one property of a party's ideal above the other and these by times cycle trusting again one over the other.    For whosoever  transcends his own ideals also loves the ideals of the opposing party loving such men as full of goodness and does hold all parties as one party through the times echoing the realities that trust the path  of the most ideal President  who simply obeys what ideal fated to be in best service of nation for the time for that ideal is nigh.     What ideals each soul holds in good esteem may differ endless and each set of ideals creating differing men in their ways yet are all good as the diversity makes a stronger profession of ways even as the way of a nation that is best is also matter only time can tell as who declared his own ideal as the only way of a nation has not honored the nation and it's people but who puts aside his own ideals that leads his way to ensure whatever time fated the ideals best for the nation at the present time are also the way the nation shall go as this may not honor your own way, as your way can not always honor the nation, but the way that best honors the nation the most,  however long your way must also be the way of the nation and the same to your ideals must be the same for your nation so do you prove your conceit both divides the nation as thought the devil to divide and conquer as only those conceited could do a work of the devil so unaware lead to the devil's deed beset in confusion conceit provides and so the senses no more see and so unawares so beset in the conceit already made comfortable to the mind as the habit of what is thought good as held to ideals to one way of politics and so one party's confusion set as dictator of your own ideal in office opposed to what greatest good comes from ideals differing from decade to decade as such variety of many different ways provide a pool of possibilities each needed when the time for election occurs so does the time elects the best ideals as the way that shall honor the nation to the greatest.    Who  must trust in only his own ideal as best this is the conceit that will one day with the conceit of all men damn us all to separation  and then the confusion that shall call our brothers enemies and then for this we will hate them also.     We do know the truth we would have loved our brothers had we known them, as if we  truly knew our fellow men then we would know one of our brothers ways are fated to be the greatest good for the nation's time and with the times each time brings the change to which what was thought the opposing party and its ideals are more ideal during one time over another and even more so with greater diversity so a finer spectrum has even a more narrow set of ideals more befitting the  hour of nation as to ensure one out of many in diversity is the present greatest good to the hour of that nation's elected way.       Leaders who forsake there own conceit and forfeit their own good view as universal to all, but only to themselves knowing the way of a nation changes with the time  as what best serves a nations path changes with the time. Wherewith, a large pool is a better diversity of ideals where more refined possibility exist to best bring forth highest good.    For every possibility of the nation's times knowing the time tells the future as well as God, so can we then predict who is the fairest of them all, simply that one of our brother's ways who we love carries the ideals befitting to this present time and so this diversity exists so no matter the time, the best ideal will be shown it self before the honest men who forsook their own conceit they were the best as the modest knew themselves well enough to know any good man and the time will speak to these modest men who know the great virtue is carried though time to a varaible difference requiring diversity to ensure what ideal for the time of the nation is available to rule always to the best interests of the nation realized least our own conceit rub us of our foresight.

It\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics. Go there now!\u201d    Sure enough, Lee was right. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my entire life. I would not have believed it, if I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes.    There was President Trump in a football stadium in Houston, Texas, giving a speech to 50,000 American Indian immigrants (from India). Yes, I said\u00a0fifty thousand.\u00a0It was Reliant Stadium, home to the Houston Texans. And it was full \u2014 like there was an NFL game going on. Trump is as popular as the NFL on a Sunday morning\u2026 with Indian immigrants.    Keep in mind the Democrat presidential frontrunners rarely get more than a hundred to a few hundred fans to show up. Trump routinely gets 10,000 to 20,000. But the press explains it away by saying \u201cit\u2019s a sea of white faces.\u201d    But these weren't white faces. These were 50,000 dark skinned immigrants from India, now proud Americans. And they love Trump. They screamed his name, \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump!\u201d They gave him standing ovations. This was clearly a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.    The Prime Minister of India stood on stage arm in arm with Trump, while the crowd cheered Trump\u2019s name. Trump could have run for Prime Minister of India at that moment and won. Amazing.    And no one in the mainstream media reported this once-in-a-lifetime event. Not a word.    Doesn\u2019t the media claim Trump is hated by people of color? Yet here were 50,000 American Indians cheering Trump like he's the \u201cKing of Indian Immigrants.\u201d    No politician in U.S. political history has ever achieved something like this. It was like a Billy Graham revival.    More proof of how Trump is changing politics. Forget polls. I speak to Hispanics and blacks every day who love Trump.    Trump\u2019s not losing in 2020.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Viable incomes for the severely disabled, the world's first, last, and only real helpless slaves.  Slaves are the base of any pyramid.  Disabled guinea pigs are the bottom.  We are enslaved as the primary working functional assests of the world's immune system to all manner of disease amongst other functions we cannot even begin to share because of oppression.  I'm talking about the chronically, severely ill people who should not be working, many of whom do, forced to sacrifice any level of stability in their existence.   Expounding my support for you is key to fully understanding and not underestimating my objectives.  I am for the health of all people.  This section should help:   ACHIEVING THE POLITICAL CENTER AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DISABLED   Some say the political center is the best place from which to run a campaign.  It could just be the best way to manage the world.  It's the only way to stay healthy. To achieve the center, you have to know where it is first. The politicians would have us believe the fence-post riders are the center.  That sounds painful.  Life has enough pain without creating more.  That\u2019s good.  I\u2019ll have to say that to Uncle Jed the next visit.   Let\u2019s look at the center in science.  In physics the center of gravity is a point from which the weight of a body or system may be considered to act.  Most of my neighbors, Uncle Jed and family think it\u2019s the vagina on women.  In uniform gravity it is the same as the center of mass (Google, excluding the joke). In chemistry science, a homogenous, (pronounced ho-modge-e-nus), from Google, is a type of mixture that is very stable, i.e., its particles do not settle, or separate.  This is what all people do.  Bullies rip us away from the main stream via torture.   As a homogeneous mixture, a solution has one phase (liquid) although the solute and solvent can vary: for example, salt water.  The key word here is stable.  In life all things are analogous to something else and I believe this is analogous to society from and including a political science perspective.  Homogenuity is essential or we exitessentially.  In each science\u2019s version of center, the conditions described are those which are inherent of the political center.  In chemistry, when creating a solution, it must be stirred to reach it\u2019s stable condition called homogenous.  That often includes heat and other factors as well but we don\u2019t have to go that far as of yet.  In society to reach this level one must be free to move around to find an area of the solution best suited to what one has to offer to contribute to society and the bottom line, I might add, so that one is stabilizing society as opposed to creating a larger burden and the consequential chaos that almost always happens.  I had to disengage from family and work just to digest.  By the same token the solution needs boundaries.  Right now that should remain countries and immigration should pretty much be halted.  If they don't they'll never improvise their own resources.  I\u2019m sure the geniuses can extrapolate an exact percentage of the necessary portion of the population needed for that stability to allow us to reach the thriving point.  Since freedom is necessary for this, one should assume that at least some particular level of liberal approach to politics is necessary to achieve the center notwithstanding, however, our conservative restrictions to ensure one moves without harming others or national security.  That\u2019s the big difference between us and a molecule of sugar.  It doesn\u2019t need laws.  Neither do animals, ultimately.  The center of gravity is already implicit in the chemistry science because your strengths are only potential if you do not have the freedom to move around and wield them because it renders your center of gravity useless.  Remember that the center of gravity is the point from which you act.  If you are not acting or forced to act at something that is not your strength your center of gravity is moot.  That's what happens to most severely disabled people.  What everybody sees is not your center no matter what the politicians call it.  Keep in mind that people that develop strengths naturally in response to their environmental conditions are responding to deficits already in society.  That\u2019s why many of us, though we have learning disabilities, are forced to look stupid because we aren\u2019t even given the opportunity to wield from our own centers to develop those strengths.  We could play a much larger role in the world\u2019s immune system from this perspective throughout all the sciences.  That might explain why I\u2019m not even a number yet.  If we had opportunity in proportion to what healthy people are afforded to exhibit our knowledge through our strengths, our true genius would be revealed.  I think society fears this because they still think we are monsters, like nobody wants a monster with power, huh?  It\u2019s a double standard.  That makes it unconstitutional because double standards of this magnitude prevent us from achieving life, liberty and happiness.   I feel the immigration has to be stopped.  Take the Middle East.  Their own people need to put pressure on them to start making their own food and water with the trillions they make from oil.  Just as pertinent, there are just to many people to encourage success by moving to the U.S.   They should be having less children as a way to stand up and say, \"\"Well, we are not going to provide another slave until we are paid viable incomes.\"\"  I did and I would do it again despite not being paid.  I would rather be dead than even go back to trying to socialize with family who will not even account for my disability.    Democrats provide republicans with slaves.  It's atrocious.  I will not come back to the democratic party and I will reman in my new party of \"\"not affiliated\"\" until there are gigantic changes including a viable income.  I was and have always been a democrat in spirit.    On another note and addressing the horrors of slavery.  (from my message to Bernie Sanders)I watched your message at https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/bernie-sanders-lets-not-make-people-overly-nervous-about-socialism.html  but you say nothing of the congenitally afflicted severely disabled people who work by conscription every day of their life without pay.  You boast about FDR's message.  He was for the disabled but nobody has yet seen the light that we deserve a viable dole from Social Security or another program.  We are your time machines.  We are men and women existing in a nightmare, bullied, used, abused, and forgotten and some of us wishing we were forgotten because of the horribleness of being bullied every minute of every day .   You mentioned that people are not rising up, that it takes millions.  These millions have been suckling on my amaciated breast since I can remember.  By surrogate mother's rights I am speaking for them with their blessings because they know they are too neanderthal to do the right thing.  They agreed with me just this morning as I was doing dishes.  People are not rising up because politicians don't do enough.  You should have to prove yourself before you are elected and then improve upon the improvements and make sure they stick after being elected.  When you lift a dysfunctional pal of water, you should always lift from the bottom.  Disabled guinea pigs are the bottom.  We are a working functional part of the world's immune system to all manner of disease yet we receive no viable compensation.  That is where you should begin.  We are the original and perpetual slaves of this country and nobody has ever viably helped us.  People thought black people's prosperity would bring the country down.  The top half wouldn't be where it is without their investments.  Now, it's time for the disabled.   This is the story of my nightmare of an existence.  Imagine Uncle Sam lifting a dysfunctional pal of water with all the disabled slaves falling out the bottom in the company of or falling into the laps of addicts, rapists, murderers  and other thieves all exposed with their die Schwanze hanging out.  We need viable incomes. When I asked Invisible Man, President Jimmy Carter for assistance with getting food out of my parents back in the 70s, all he did was laugh at me.  ______________________________________________________________________________________  2. Lower the population.  The population is too big.  Politicians and Corporations need to find a way to increase their bottom line based on the health of their two biggest resources, people and the environment.  The disabled are footing the bill and bearing the brunt of all the world's aggression.       ________________________________________________________________________________________  3. Build forests in the U.S. -   We don't have are to breath or wather to drink.  I am sick every day from the pollution.  We have a better chance of making the Ohio Valley the next oxygen producing rain forest than throwing money at people who don't care about civil rights.  The money is bond to fund cheap drugs to distribute in the U.S. so all those poor drug dealers can join the  50% of the country that did so well the past 20 years and want to help their recreational team while the disabled foot the bill.\" ", "Jim Blissitt": "#youtubeandrewyang ", "thepeaceful66": "\"Let\u2019s organize marches!

Since he sees billionaires as unfairly having far too much wealth relative to others  he wants to believe that they actually reduce how well the economy functions for everyone else.  By vilifying them as evil he can justify confiscating their wealth for the \"\"greater good\"\".   But the greater good isn't being served by eliminating billionaires.          The fact is that most billionaires serve as the leaders of the private sector and the only way they can become successful is by making their customer's lives better.  Some do it by giving us lower prices and more convenience (like Jeff Bezos at Amazon) and others do it by giving us new technologies that improve our lives (like Steve Jobs at Apple or Bill Gates at Microsoft).  Others may do it by taking on the risk of investing their money in new ventures that might make consumer's lives better, or by simply putting their money in a bank so it can be lent out to people to buy homes or to help small businesses to expand.        Today, there isn't a single prosperous country on earth that doesn't have billionaires.  Just 50 years ago, China was a country in which many people were actually starving to death.  But in just the last 30 years they have opened up their economy to more trade and capitalism which has turned them into one of the fastest growing economies on earth.  This new freedom has also led to an explosion of billionaires that have led their growth.  Even egalitarian scandinavian countries like Sweden have more than twice the billionaires per capita than the USA.

I should say that heart disease is definitely something that you should seek to avoid. It can be life ending or life limiting, sometimes very life limiting. My point though is that there are many possible outcomes and even though Bernie is old that need not preclude him from high office. After all. rather uniquely the US system has provision for this sort of thing. You vote for a ticket that includes a Vice President as well as a president. In light of Bernie's health scare It would be especially wise for him to choose a good vice presidential candidate. I hope the need will not arise but it would be a good provision. Warren would seem like a good choice.     However, if Warren is the main candidate I think Bernie should probably (and would probably) not be a suitable vice presidential candidate. He has one last shot left at President I think (nobody can defy time forever). I like the guy, but looking at the US from afar I think his big mistake was to call himself a socialist. For a start from here in Europe he doesn't seem like socialist; mild centre left, social democrat perhaps...    But it doesn't matter that much the labels at the end of the day. If you have good policies. If you explain how they should work an your motivations then you have a chance of success. If someone calls you a socialist or a liberal and if that is what you are by all means say yes that is true and defend it. But the times of hanging the fortunes of the people that really matter, the poor and disadvantaged, are not now so well served by slogans and banners, these have been appropriated by the right. Descend to their level at your peril.     Look back at the history of Germany in the late 20s and the 30s. There are striking and unsettling parallels. I am not calling Trump a Fascist. They were crude and ignorant, but they were able to maintain a pretence of intellectual validity that Trump cannot sustain. A good thing too or else by now he would be wreaking far greater harm than he has so far accomplished. What I am saying is that a Trump is a huge danger to the US, to the Allies of the US, the environment, any hope of peace in the Middle East (as recently evidenced)...    Well I could go on, but as I already have I will simply say that if you have read this far without disagreeing with at least one thing that I have said then,  well, good.

Any true revolution of today  has to be social as well. Marianne Williamson does a better job of emphasizing that. Turner may be a good political front person  but Sanders needs the holistic message of Williamson and the futurist message of Yang. Turner could be the bridge to bring the impoverished among Blacks into this new consciousness. All of these candidates have their strong suites but  none of them are Gods. They need all the help they can get and that we can give them. Who among them is making the people aware of the impact the level of violence has on the cost of healthcare? Who is applying the same logic to the cost of waste  and theft in government budgets? Who is telling the people that  if the government is to do more for you  the government will naturally have more say in certain aspects of your left. Conservatives will scare people into thinking that socialism will take away their rights  but they will never point out that any society has to have certain control over individual actions. Peer pressure does the same thing on certain levels and in certain aspects of our lives. If one gets a contagious decease any society will quarantine that person  for the good of all. When people live among others they sometimes have to sublimate or make subordinate personal desires. Progressives have to be out front on issues like this  that Conservatives know all too well  how to use on their constituents  to keep them in line with their thinking. Futurist thinking would say to the people that we have to focus on the common good  and retain our humanity  for the future may make us so independent of each other  that we might forget form whence we came.   I suspect that many Blacks who are new to conservatism, are so because of economics. They dream of being wealthy, and want all the benefits of it. Their perceptive and philosophy on life is that of self reliance and perseverance, just as it is with White Conservatives. On the other hand, significant numbers of Blacks have adapted to the culture of poverty, and lack sufficient amounts of self regard and self worth. In this state, they are in a sense a weak links in the social chain. The chain or society is strongest when each link or individual is strong. The patriotism that Conservatives value, is just a commitment to the society. Socialism or broader support from the government, requires the same kind of commitment, by any other name, in order for the system to be inefficient. The sooner this message is conveyed and embraced by those who need greater support from the government, the faster this society can get to a more just society. Pop cultural icons, if they think of themselves as being woke, have to be visionary, if not prophetic. People like Killer Mike, (and I have to say, I have to question someone who would use the word 'Killer as part of their name, especially; one in a field of endeavor, in which words are given such value) should be emphasizing the need for the people he speaks for, to understand how culture and politics inform each other. Hip-Hop should be seriously examining how aspects of its culture is complimentary or contradictory to the current social and political trends. I don't think Hip-Hop is ready to do that. Hopefully the year 2020 will begin a period of reflection for Hip-Hop. Afterwards, hopefully it will emerge with 2020hindsight, and will have learned from its successes and mistakes, and be able to see more clearly the future that is ahead, and move forward with that clear vision, to correct and right the wrongs in society, and put in place the stepping stone for the next evolutionary phase of human development. All Black people and aspects of Black life need to apply this 2020hindsight , but especially Hip-Hop.\" ", "2019-12-19T10:23:07.000Z": "Lateef Khamisi \"Love to Bernie and respect his service but I can't vote for him because he won't be a good President.

Cenk Uygur  former Republican turned Progressive of The Young Turks  has the type of controversial past you would expect of almost any former Republican. Heck  I used to be a Fox News watching  right wing Christian fundamentalist. Now I\u2019m ashamed of all that nonsense. Of course if you dig into his conservative past\u2014that has nothing to do with his current convictions\u2014 you will find dirt. You can find dirt on anyone. Back when  like many of us  he was on the wrong side of history  it I was expected that he parrot some of the rhetoric and attitudes that most define central aspects of the GOP  including comments that come across as xenophobic and sexists. But for far more years Cenk has denounced that misguided way of thinking and fought hard for the very opposite. Anyone familiar with TYT knows where they stand. They are unequivocally Progressive. That is why this smear campaign by the Democrats against Cenk is so repulsive and reminiscent of the tactics used by Trumpists. Establishment Dems are terrified of progressives and will literally lie to destroy them. Until recently I thought Bernie Sanders was not part of the establishment. His previous endorsement of Cenk made perfect sense  as Cenk is metonymically the future. Then Bernie un-endorsed Cenk and  consequently  added his stamp of approval to the lie-based character assassination of one of the most outspoken progressives of our time. So will I be voting for someone like Bernie who can be so easily bought and who  like Trump  is so quick to throw people under the bus just to get ahead politically? That is not the Bernie I know. I don\u2019t want to believe that about him but now I am forced to consider that he may not be the best choice for presidential candidate. I\u2019m giving Bernie Sanders one month to stand on the right side of this smear campaign and defend truth and justice.

It stands for supporting a certain capitalist economic system - the so called \"\"trickle down economy\"\" - which favors corporations and their owners over common working class and middle class people. The hope is that if you make corporations pay less in taxes and restrict them less in order to allow them to gain greater profits they will share those profits in a fair manner with their employees.  It just turned out that this believe was - to say it in very friendly terms - very starry-eyed or naive. Over the last three decades the upper 1% had a wealth increase of $ 21 trillion while the lower half of the US citizens had to face a decline in their wealth for somewhat around $ 800 billion. This proves that the corporations didn't share their profits in a fair manner with their employees. Instead they outsourced a lot of jobs to countries with low workforce costs and even lower restrictions.  This kind of neoliberal economic system finally failed and crashed in 2008. Unfortunately - instead of seriously changing the economic system - the in the meanwhile utterly corrupted political establishment decided to bail out that economic system by putting the burden onto the backs of the common people and continued to do business as usual. The central banks like the FED and the EZB were allowed to take nearly any measure to further stabilize that economic system.   Unfortunately those measures aren't designed to be long term solutions and the central banks are slowly coming to the point where they are running out of options. But these central banks were originally only meant to step in to ease out downturns and not to stabilize an already failing neoliberal trickle down economic system.  So now you should ask yourself what might happen once the central banks completely run out of options and are then unable to further stabilize that economic system, because then there won't be any further safety net preventing the worst outcome.   Because the intervention of the central banks over those last years is something that has never happened before, it is difficult to say when the turning point will be reached.

Trump's accord in Helsinki with Pres. Putin of Russia.  Sanders stood in unison with the late Sen. John McCain in harshly reproaching Trump for admitting the US role in threatening the security of Russia since the departure of former Pres. Yeltsin.  2.  Sanders has a record of supporting US foreign interventions and voted twice in support of overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein.   His foreign policy record is not much different from Hillary Clinton's.   See https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/16/blood-traces-bernies-iraq-war-hypocrisy/  3. In his current campaigning,  he is silent on foreign policy issues.   He is not cultivating a mandate for major changes in foreign policy, changes necessary to take funds from armaments and put them to work at home.   4.  Sanders is an elder.   He should be supporting a  young candidate who is explicit about cutting the US military budget, who has the youth, energy and talent to make the changes in foreign and domestic policy required for domestic social justice.   There is such a candidate,   Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.  There is no reason for Sanders to attempt at age 80, in January 2021, to take on such an eight year challenge.

Bush (and the intelligence agencies) lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  Obama weaponized the intelligence community and spied on Trump's campaign  plus he allowed Hillary Clinton's foundation to get millions in donations from foreign governments while she was Secretary of State in a clear conflict of interest  he also allowed Hunter Biden to racketeer millions of dollars from the Ukraine and China monetizing Vice President Joe Biden's office.  The biggest problem Bernie Sanders is going to have is that Trump as corrupt as he is  he has exposed the corruption in the Washington establishment like no other president before him.  So Bernie better show how he will fight corruption better than Trump.  People want specifics and will not buy into empty rhetoric.  The main threat to America today are the FBI  CIA  and the various local police departments that all enable the political corruption to go on and are active participants in it.  Remember we are talking about government corruption  and I don't see how you fight government corruption with more government.  I think some major reforms are necessary to protect civil liberties and the privacy of americans  the United States has turned into a police state and major reforms are required.  If Bernie brings this up he will tap into the hearts of americans.  The other thing is to point out the record debt and record deficits under the Trump administration  Bernie should be clear what he plans to do to rein in the deficit  maybe higher taxes and maybe cutting spending  and as unpopular as it may appear to be it needs to be laid out.  Finally Trump is in the pockets of Wall Street and the stock market has had a record run  Trump by pushing the Fed for lower rates and more quantitative easing (increasing the money supply) has enriched millions in Wall Street  while savers are being ripped off by low interest rates and reckless borrowing is being encouraged by it plus stock prices have skyrocketed as a result of this easy money policies that have favored the rich.  So yes  Trump is corrupt  but be careful where he is corrupt and where he is not  Trump did nothing wrong to be impeached  however his economic policies have made more billionaires than ever by sending stock prices through the roof  and this is corrupt because he's borrowing and incurring deficits in times of prosperity when America should be paying down the debt  borrowing and deficits are good in recessions  but 2008-2009 recession ended 10 years ago  it is time to get the fiscal house in order in Washington.\" ", "Livon Diramerian": "Any president better represent the totality of the people.

We need to accomplish this world wide. It will take a movement and time - if we have much left.

", "RETiredGM": "\"The government compulsory factory education system must undergo a radicle paradigm shift in its role in social engineering. Critical thinking  skepticism  and problem solving must be key components of a national education system  not rote memorization and teaching to the \"\"standardized\"\" test.    The current factor (mis)education system is designed to do anything but enlighten and uplift. This system is intended from inception to primary do 3 things. 1) condition the unquestioning obedience to state authorities, 2) provide a rudimentary, non critical thinking education to maximum productivity at the lowest possible wage, and 3) to provide a shared white supremacy revisionist historical mythology to foster a substanceless sense of America exceptionalism and nationalist pride.    That needs to end.    The 5 Steps to Critical Thinking:    What is critical thinking?  In general, critical thinking refers to actively questioning statements rather than blindly accepting them.    Critical thinking results in radical free will.    1. The critical thinker is flexible yet maintains an attitude of healthy skepticism.    Critical thinkers are open to new information, ideas, and claims. They genuinely consider alternative explanations and possibilities. However, this open-mindedness is tempered by a healthy sense of skepticism (Hyman, 2007).     The critical thinker consistently asks, \u201cWhat evidence supports this claim?\u201d      2. The critical thinker scrutinizes the evidence before drawing conclusions.    Critical thinkers strive to weigh all the available evidence before arriving at conclusions. And, in evaluating evidence, critical thinkers distinguish between empirical evidence versus opinions based on feelings or personal experience.    3. The critical thinker can assume other perspectives.    Critical thinkers are not imprisoned by their own points of view. Nor are they limited in their capacity to imagine life experiences and perspectives that are fundamentally difference from their own. Rather, the critical thinker strives to understand and evaluate issues from many different angles.    4. The critical thinker is aware of biases and assumptions.    In evaluating evidence and ideas, critical thinkers strive to identify the biases and assumptions that are inherent in any argument (Riggio & Halpern, 2006). Critical thinkers also try to identify and minimize the influence of their own biases.    5. The critical thinker engages in reflective thinking.    Critical thinkers avoid knee-jerk responses. Instead, critical thinkers are reflective. Most complex issues are unlikely to have a simple solution. Therefore, critical thinkers resist the temptation to sidestep complexity by boiling an issue down to an either/or, yes/no kind of proposition. Instead, the critical thinker expects and accepts complexity (Halpern, 2007).    Critical thinking is not a single skill, but rather a set of attitudes and thinking skills. As is true with any set of skills, you can get better at these skills with practice.    In a nut shell, critical thinking is the active process of minimizing preconceptions and biases while evaluating evidence, determining the conclusions that can be reasonably be drawn from evidence, and considering alternative explanations for research findings or other phenomena.    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS  >Why might other people want to discourage you from critical thinking?    >In what situations is it probably most difficult or challenging for you to exercise critical thinking skills? Why?    > What can you do or say to encourage others to use critical thinking in evaluating questionable claims or assertions?\" ", "Darcy Barnes": "It could take a civil uprising to actually stop corruption!
