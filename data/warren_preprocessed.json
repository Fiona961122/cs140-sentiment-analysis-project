 warren supports a social security benefits expansion by sending cost-of-living adjustment checks to retirees at a time when inflation is almost nonexistent . admittedly , president barack obama and clinton join warren in calling for similar expansions , but that does n't mean it is n't fiscal folly . future retirees would be a lot better off if warren proposed a realistic plan to shore up social security than by piling on new costs .  then there is warren 's application of a `` hell , no '' litmus test to nominations of people who worked on wall street . she stopped antonio weiss , a former lazard investment banker , from becoming the treasury department 's undersecretary for domestic finance without ever meeting him . warren 's standard would disqualify someone such as laurence d. fink , the head of blackrock , the world 's largest investment manager , from becoming treasury secretary . fink was an early supporter of financial-industry reforms , including some that would have adversely affected the money-market mutual funds blackrock owns .  in pushing these ideas , warren sees herself as a progressive crusader , protecting the underdog from a rigged system . but if carried out , her policies could end up hurting the very groups she is championing .  [ by : paula dwyer writes editorials on economics , finance and politics for bloomberg view -11/12/16 ]  also warren and some of the the socialist democrats but especially warren that wants to get rid of the electoral college { the electoral college is a process , not a place . 1 ] the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens . 2 ] the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress ... . } .

//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-candidate-interviews.html     bernie sanders is very strong on israel and use aid as leverage to make them sign peace instead of taking us to start new wars warren is very weak on israel , watch link above , her response on israel was disgusting     unlike warren , bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the general election . warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the primary , so bernie wo n't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected .     bernie has army bigger than us military ( 2 millions volunteer ) which are united and get together for any purposes to let him push his policy . warren does not have the left support as bernie has , so she may face issue pursuing her agenda after getting to power .     third concern , i feel in debates , warren will be crashed by donald , you know the guy has no principles     she originally planned on voting for ben carson as secretary of housing , but then flip flopped when she was criticized .     warren is progressive with playing lots of dirty politics , , i do not consider her as honest person.her biggest problem to me is her general trait of playing politics as she did in 2016 by supporting hillary . what sets her apart from bernie is her lack of support and playing politics .     warren worked to repeal the 'medical device tax ' which helped fund the aca , in order to appease the medical device industry in her state .     unlike warren , bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s . warren was a staunch republican up until the late 90s .     bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress , he was a mayor in vermont , and has a lot of experience in governance compared to warren .     warren 's plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially unconstitutional , therefore harder to implement than bernie 's wall street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities .     warren voted twice to increase the military budget brought forth under pres . trump , which appropriated over $ 81billion for purchase of aircraft , weapons , missiles , and combat vehicles . on top of that it appropriated several billion dollars toward other parts of the dod .       bernie wants to cancel all student debt , warren wants to implement a means-tested solution . a means-tested program will likely further split people into the `` '' haves '' '' vs. `` '' have-nots '' '' and are easier to attack , dismantle , and weaken .     there is also a more nuanced distinction between them i 'd like to make , with all the political differences aside . the one area i think bernie absolutely dominates where warren does n't , is with rhetoric . they both are offering tons of plans , but to me bernie is the only candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed . if you want to implement even a fraction of either warren 's or bernie 's plans you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country , and i have never seen a politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the political process as well as bernie has . in 2015 he was nothing but a small independent senator from vermont , and he went on to win 23 contests against the establishment backed former first lady , secretary of state , and senator of new york . now he is arguably one of the most popular politicians in america , and he has changed the political rhetoric among leading democrats . just look at the incredibly influential organizations that stemmed out of his 2016 campaign ''", "Pablo Rodr\u00edguez": "comment time: 2019-08-21T00:07:58.000Z at least she was originally proud to have thought to have been native american

'' ''  answer : the subject ofabortionis perhaps one of the most highly charged issues of our day . finding an honest answer to the question `` is abortion murder ? '' takes courage for those who have performed abortions orhave had abortionsthemselves . the bible is clear about the fact that murder is wrong ( exodus 20:13 ) . however , in some cases , the bible does not forbid killing . soldiers representing their country were expected to kill soldiers on the opposing side ( joshua 11:20 ) . that is not murder . animals were killed for food and for sacrifice ( exodus 24:5 ; genesis 9:34 ) . that is not murder either .  murder is defined as `` the unlawful , premeditated killing of one human being by another . '' murder is unlawful killingthat is , killing that is done by the judgment of one human being against another , for personal ( rather than national ) reasons . the bible condemns murder repeatedly as a characteristic of a wicked society ( deuteronomy 5:17 ; isaiah 1:21 ; hosea 4:2 ; matthew 5:21 ) . determining whether or not abortion is murder involves two considerations : first , whether or not a fetus in utero is actually a human being , and , second , if a fetus is a child , whether or not abortion can be rightly called murder since it is legal in most countries . if murder is unlawful killing , it would follow that a lawful killing would not be murder .  one reason murder is outlawed in many places is that it is unethical for one person to unilaterally decide the fate of another . under the old testament law , a murderer was not put to death unless there were multiple witnesses : `` no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness '' ( numbers 35:30 ) . in war , soldiers do not decide to kill for their own purposes ; rather , they kill in the national interestif they fight for an honorable nation , the national interest will be to protect innocent civilians from some threat . abortion is different . abortion is killing based on a mother 's unilateral judgment and choice . such unprovoked killing of the defenseless is unethical and should define abortion as murder in any societyunless the fetus is not human . if the fetus is just a mass of impersonal tissue or something less than human , ending its life would not face the same ethical challenge and would not be considered murder .  so , is a fetus a human ? or is it something else ? biologically speaking , human life begins at conception . when the mother 's egg and the father 's sperm come together , they combine and create a new string of dna that is personalized and totally unique . dna is coded information , the blueprint for the new human 's growth and development . no more genetic material needs to be added ; the zygote in the womb is as human as the mother in whose womb it dwells . the difference between a fetus and any one of us is one of age , location , and level of dependence . when a mother aborts the process of fetal development , she is destroying a unique life .  the bible clearly points to conception as the beginning of human life . samson said , `` i have been a nazirite to god from my mother 's womb '' ( judges 16:17 ) . he refers to his unborn self as having already been what god planned him to bea nazirite . david says , `` you formed my inward parts ; you knitted me together in my mother 's womb '' ( psalm 139:13 ) . again , we see david referring to himself as a person in the womb . then , he says , `` your eyes saw my unformed substance ; in your book were written , every one of them , the days that were formed for me , when as yet there was none of them '' ( psalm 139:16 ) . david is saying that god had all of his days planned out for him while he was still in the womb . again , this evidence points to personhood beginning at conception , rather than at the moment of birth . we see god had a similar plan for the life of the pre-born jeremiah : `` before i formed you in the womb i knew you , before you were born i set you apart ; i appointed you as a prophet to the nations '' ( jeremiah 1:5 ) .  the bible considers a fetus to be an unborn child , a planned human being that god is forming from the moment of conception . this being the case , it does n't really matter what human jurisprudence says or how socially or politically acceptable abortion is . god 's law takes precedence . a mother who decides to abort her child is unilaterally making a decision to end another person 's lifeand that is and always has been the definition of murder .

'' https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=g_a7dqxilco & t=4s ( youtube title : the inconvenient truth about the democratic party ) script by african american professor carol swain :  when you think about racial equality and civil rights , which political party comes to mind ? the republicans ? or , the democrats ?  most people would probably say the democrats . but this answer is incorrect .  since its founding in 1829 , the democratic party has fought against every major civil rights initiative , and has a long history of discrimination .  the democratic party defended slavery , started the civil war , opposed reconstruction , founded the ku klux klan , imposed segregation , perpetrated lynchings , and fought against the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s .  in contrast , the republican party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party . its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it entirely . this effort , however , was dealt a major blow by the supreme court . in the 1857 case dred scott v. sandford , the court ruled that slaves are n't citizens ; they 're property . the seven justices who voted in favor of slavery ? all democrats . the two justices who dissented ? both republicans .   the slavery question was , of course , ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war . the commander-in-chief during that war was the first republican president , abraham lincoln the man who freed the slaves .   six days after the confederate army surrendered , john wilkes booth , a democrat , assassinated president lincoln . lincoln 's vice president , a democrat named andrew johnson , assumed the presidency . but johnson adamantly opposed lincoln 's plan to integrate the newly freed slaves into the south 's economic and social order .   johnson and the democratic party were unified in their opposition to the 13th amendment , which abolished slavery ; the 14th amendment , which gave blacks citizenship ; and the 15th amendment , which gave blacks the vote . all three passed only because of universal republican support .   during the era of reconstruction , federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for the newly freed slaves . hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as republicans , and 22 black republicans served in the us congress by 1900 . the democrats did not elect a black man to congress until 1935 .   but after reconstruction ended , when the federal troops went home , democrats roared back into power in the south . they quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with measures like black codes laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run businesses . and they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests , used to subvert the black citizen 's right to vote .  and how was all of this enforced ? by terror -- much of it instigated by the ku klux klan , founded by a democrat , nathan bedford forrest .   as historian eric foner - himself a democrat - notes : `` in effect , the klan was a military force serving the interests of the democratic party .

( warren , notably , refused to take the bait . ) ''  this sentiment was echoed by jay rosen , who claimed that trying to pin warren down on whether her policies would raise taxes on the middle class should be a `` credibility killer '' for the press !  on the contrary , the idea that questions about the cost of major policy proposals might be exploited in the general election is a good reason to hash them out in a primary debate . it 's sort of the point of primary season . and it 's not `` taking the bait '' for warren to give an honest and straightforward answer about how to pay for her signature policy ideas .  the longer warren remains the frontrunner , the more these questions will come up . her inability or unwillingness to give honest answers should concern democrats who need to persuade non-leftist americans to support their nominee . as things now stand , warren herself created a few nice gop campaign ads tuesday night .

it seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attackedso viscously and mercilessly each time like clockwork . how does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party ?   whatever the justification , the reason is clear : it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color . by leaving the democratic party , they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics . if you stop thinking about yourself as an african-american , or muslim-american or hispanic-american , and start thinking about yourself as an american , then the left can not control you through fear anymore . they want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that republics are racists , and once you stop believing that , they lose all their power .   it concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person , but as an individual with their own ideas that can not be defined by where they came from or how they look . they have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy , principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race . since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts , they can not be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power . in essence , they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly . and this scares the hell out of democrats , to the point of rage , because when people lose power they become angry . hence why democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race , but yet the democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear . if every black person thinks differently and independently , how will the democrats control the entire bunch ?   the number one agenda of the democratic party is portray all white males , especially those in the republican party as inherent racist . and if you 're not racists then you 're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue . we see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs , even if only subtly alluded to . race underpins the discussions surrounding everything : sports , immigration , law enforcement , foreign policy , education , hollywood and even climate change . it is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change , right ? if democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines , in every aspect of american life , then they can easily control us with one message , through the mechanisms of fear and hate .   here is how they do it : they report on a story and make it always about race . they then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism , because we all know you ca n't shoot the messenger . after they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories , they then say their agenda is to bring us back together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines . rinse and repeat . their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest , leaving us to hang in the balance , while they pull their strings like puppeteers , laughing all the way to the bank .   by making race the number one focus , it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies . they do n't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel . they will not be held accountable for actually improving american lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what 's actually really important : which is policy . endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats , because no matter how bad they themselves behave , well , at least they 're not racist , right ?
