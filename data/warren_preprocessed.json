Elizabeth Warren is signaling that she would push a Clinton presidency to adopt her vision of a progressive agenda.    Some of her ideas, though, could have consequences counter to what she says her goals are: helping workers, raising incomes and ensuring that the system is fair for everyone.    I\u2019m not even referring to Warren\u2019s blanket opposition to free-trade deals, which have long riven the Democratic Party, nor to her obsession with bringing back the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act to force large banks to break into investment and commercial banking halves. This would address a problem that doesn\u2019t exist, and in any case Clinton isn\u2019t likely to put Glass-Steagall on the table.    The tug of war might occur on other issues, such as tax and entitlement policies and senior appointments, over which Warren hopes to exert her influence.    Here are five examples of her bad ideas:    \u2014 She has called for raising corporate taxes to an unspecified level, while ignoring evidence that workers would bear most of the cost in the form of lower wages. She backs up her position by noting that U.S. corporations account for one-tenth of federal revenue today, compared with one-third in the 1950s. But she neglects to mention that rapid expansions in Social Security and the creation of Medicare affected this equation. By the 1970s, payroll taxes to fund those entitlement programs made the contributions from other sources seem smaller. By the 1980s, corporate taxes had declined to 12.5 percent of all U.S. tax revenue, and that was long before U.S. companies started a wave of tax inversions by moving their headquarters to a lower-tax country.    \u2014 If she is vague on new corporate-tax levels, she is specific in her goal of requiring the federal government to allow refinancing of student debt at lower interest rates. But in a forthcoming book titled \u201cGame of Loans,\u201d Beth Akers of the Brookings Institution and Matthew Chingos of the Urban Institute explain why this would do almost nothing for truly struggling borrowers, who can apply for income-based repayments that would allow them to write minimal monthly checks, or to suspend payments. Affluent borrowers who take out hefty loans to attend graduate schools (and presumably obtain high-paying jobs enabling them to repay their debts) would get a windfall.    \u2014 One of Warren\u2019s wackier proposals would require the IRS to prepare tax returns. Not only would that wipe out private tax-preparation services, including Intuit\u2019s Turbo Tax and other low-cost software, it would also pile billions in new costs onto an agency that has trouble getting Congress to fund it adequately now. The IRS\u2019s conflict of interest would also be huge: What incentive would a government tax-collection agency have to reduce anyone\u2019s tax bill, as Turbo Tax seeks to do?    \u2014 Warren supports a Social Security benefits expansion by sending cost-of-living adjustment checks to retirees at a time when inflation is almost nonexistent. Admittedly, President Barack Obama and Clinton join Warren in calling for similar expansions, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t fiscal folly. Future retirees would be a lot better off if Warren proposed a realistic plan to shore up Social Security than by piling on new costs.    \u2014 Then there is Warren\u2019s application of a \u201chell, no\u201d litmus test to nominations of people who worked on Wall Street. She stopped Antonio Weiss, a former Lazard investment banker, from becoming the Treasury Department\u2019s undersecretary for domestic finance without ever meeting him. Warren\u2019s standard would disqualify someone such as Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment manager, from becoming Treasury secretary. Fink was an early supporter of financial-industry reforms, including some that would have adversely affected the money-market mutual funds BlackRock owns.    In pushing these ideas, Warren sees herself as a progressive crusader, protecting the underdog from a rigged system. But if carried out, her policies could end up hurting the very groups she is championing.

", "Florida Scot": "\"She is ranked the 76th wealthiest member of 535 representatives and senators. Including her luxurious home  Warren\u2019s average net worth is $8.75 million. According to CNN Money  the senator declined to comment on her exorbitant wealth. It appears she is very much in the 1%  but won\u2019t publicly admit it.  One of her favorite talking points is the \u201cshrinking middle class\u201d and \u201cincome inequality\u201d. Such ambiguous terminology makes for great rhetoric. She fails, however, to clarify where this \u201cmiddle class\u201d has shrunk to. Are they less wealthy than before? Well, according to CNBC, there are more millionaires in the United States than ever before.  By measuring income through tax units, as opposed to households, income inequality becomes less apparent. Economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research used this more accurate metric to decipher if the middle class is, in fact, shrinking. They found that the \u201cshrinking middle class\u201d has shrunk its way to higher incomes and greater wealth.  Warren is a politician who panders to her base with no regard for how that might actually turn out. Her support for a shocking $22 minimum wage stands out amongst them all. She reaches this conclusion because it would be so high if it had kept up with productivity.  She generalizes the word \u201cproductivity\u201d, but sidesteps economic reality. Wages are not a reflection of productivity. Labor markets set wages through employer competition and consumer valuation of a product. For example, if a burger flipper becomes \u201cmore productive\u201d that does not mean the consumer suddenly wishes to pay more for their burger. Furthermore, their wage fluctuation is not a result of their output. Compensation is not determined by the amount of labor required.  The Senator completely ignores empirical evidence that minimum wages are simply redistribution schemes amongst low-income families. In fact, minimum wages increase the chances some families escape poverty while equally increasing the chances other families fall in to poverty. Thus, the net result is, at best, breaking even.  A review of long run employment and minimum wages concluded that there is very little, if any, convincing evidence that minimum wages have a positive effect on employment. In fact, almost all empirical analysis points to a negative effect on employment. The exception? Minimum wages force young people to remain in school longer, thus boosting their human capital. However, there is no indication that would alleviate poverty.  Lastly, Warren repeatedly claims that families have not had income increases for the last 30 years. She must not have access to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. According to their data, total compensation of employees, both wage and salary, has risen dramatically; specifically more in the last 30 years.  Liberals hold her as a supposed champion in the fight against corporate welfare, despite her support for the Export-Import Bank. A closer look at the Ex-Im loaning practices reveal that they are, in fact, a corporate welfare stronghold. Boeing, for example, would have to finance $7 to $9 billion if the Ex-Im bank were to close tomorrow. Following Boeing, the Ex-Im loans huge sums of money to Caterpillar, General Electric, and United Technologies just to name a few.  Senator Elizabeth Warren is either oblivious to reality or she blatantly lies to her base for a self-aggrandizing agenda. She consistently expresses unfounded opinions and maintains hypocritical stances on issues that can easily be debunked with some economic know-how and internet searches.  Democrats rightly fear her extremism because it alienates their moderate base as well as open the door for criticism.

She won\u2019t take on the insurance companies.  \u274c When she applauded Trump for saying \u201cAmerica will never be Socialist\u201d. Nobody is even trying to be a socialist country. It\u2019s the sentiment that she knew what he was referring to. He was referring to progressives and she stood up and clapped for him.  \u274c When she endorsed Hillary over Bernie. She could have endorsed him early in the race. Instead of waiting when it was clear Bernie wasn\u2019t going to win. She after admitted the race was rigged.    If Bernie gets an A as far as being progressive, someone like Biden would get an F and Warren would get a C-. Which is nothing to brag about.

But there are extremes that pale beyond comparison  except in terms of the 19th century Robber Barron's of America. So what to do America? I say that 585 Billionaire in America is not necessarily bad  except that the erosion of the Middle Class shows that the Wealth Shift affect is deleterious to Democracy. Concentrated wealth stifles freedom. I don't see much freedom in China or the Russian Federation. And it seems that Corporate America has a bit of a predatory style  toward American civil society.    So we end up essentially like Feudal Europe in the Middle Ages. I would like to see more millionaires and if having on 58 Billionaires gets us to have 10,000 more Millionaires then, that shows a stronger and more equitable distribution of wealth.     So if income tax can be restructured to change tax burden that will both grow the middle class without completely eliminating the wealthy all together, who could say it was a bad idea? The problem with tax law is that the wealthy have extremely great resources at their disposal that allow tax manipulation.     The middle class simply needs complete tax exemption, at least in the beginning.     So I am in favor of $0 tax for the individual up to $70,000/year gross income.   Then that can be taxed anything above $70K at 4% until the individual reaches $200K per year.   Then anything above $200K per year is taxes at 8% up to $400K/year.   And anything above $400K can be taxed at 16%. And this goes on doubling the marginal tax rate for every $200K per year until you \u2026.32% on income above $600K, and 64% on income above $1.2 Million per year...all WITH ABSOLUTELY NO DEDUCTIONS OR EXEMPTIONS.      After all  we are excluding the first $70K as tax free income. This give young people a chance to save for things that Government needs  to eventually stop doing....subsidizing health insurance, social security, and other entitlements. If people realize they have a chance to make it, they will have incentives to work. Not rely on the Government.     So it does help the young and the less fortunate to start out on a level playing field. And it does disincentive Wealth a bit. But so what? That is a pretty high income level to get to the 64% income tax marginal rate...$1.2 Million and above.    And this would still  remain the case if married or single. No children or children.  No deductions and No exemptions.

It is not about starting a class warfare  or shaming anyone for being ambitious and successful at what they do. It's about designing an economic market that properly functions.    I don\u2019t think the super wealthy sit around and think \u201cdon\u2019t want anyone else to get as rich as us,\u201d no. Many at the top are greedy, yes, but mainly I think they are in an obsessive arms race with each other brought on by the lack of regulation in the system; they live in fear that if their corporation has to pay more taxes, or their top dogs are getting paid less fabulously, or they raise wages, or they keep costs low, they will lose a tiny bit of competitive edge that, in a very competitive and volatile market, is enough to risk seeing the company go under down the road, or lead to personal embarrassment in the business community for being less profitable than another CEO. I believe they are highly focused on the competitive goals of themselves and their company above anything else. In a way they are as much \"\"victims\"\" of the current system as the working class; they didn't make the rules (or lack thereof), but have to abide by them to have success in what they do.    But this can\u2019t go on ad infinitum or wages will continue to stagnate, costs will continue to rise, and we\u2019ll continue seeing more depressions as the purchasing power of the working/middle class is depleted. From a macroeconomic perspective it is not sustainable. If the financial and business industries all had to abide by the same stricter regulations, in theory it would not affect the competitiveness of one company over another, and it would put more economic stability back with the working and middle class, and keep a healthy economy flowing. As Warren explains in the clip, an unregulated market led to a pattern of boom and bust for most of US history. When tough regulations were put in place after WW2, we went through a nearly 50 year period without seeing a depression, until these regulations started to be stripped away under Reagan.    http://www.cc.com/video-clips/dbjssy/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-elizabeth-warren-pt--2\" ", "2019-02-12T18:20:42.000Z": "Lynchy The Classical Liberal Will she run as the first native American candidate I wonder?

The reasoning behind allowing owners & CEOs to make SO much more $$ than workers  is bc supposedly they will invest that money into creating more jobs. But  if instead  corps & wealthy ppl are investing in foreign banks  that money isn't creating new jobs  nor helping the US economy even a little bit. Wealthy ppl are constantly *investing* money in expensive  often imported goods  often goods that the making & selling of which  don't do much for the economy bc small workforces are making tons of money. Goods like Paintings  other types of art  jewelry \u00a0designer furniture  fancy cars  expensive wines  couture clothing (everything Karl Lagerfeld ever designed just jumped up in value)  yachts  gold toilets and bathroom fixtures. They own mansions & penthouses all over the world  and the ones in foreign countries aren't creating jobs here. Wealthy ppl are hoarders  and the stuff they hoard  the money they hide in foreign countries with low taxes  are doing NOTHING for our economy - gold toilets  boxes of heirloom jewelry  & money in foreign banks  aren't creating any jobs in the US.     Cutting Capital Gains taxes was a HUGE goal of the GOP during Dubya's admim - y'know, back when the GOP nearly drove our country into bankruptcy. Back when big banks got huge chunks of corp welfare to help them out of the financial disaster they got us all into bc Dubya cut regulations, telling us CEOs cld \"\"police themselves,\"\" but instead they caused a mortgage crisis and nearly drove their OWN businesses under, for which, btw, they rewarded themselves with bonuses and raises.    So taxing wealth is fair, and if you couple that with bringing back the 90% tax rate on the wealthiest earners, it wld essentially apply a maximum wage on owners and CEOs, encouraging them to share more of the profits from production with the workers who produce it, rather than they get to invest more in the Stock Market - which actually effects very few Americans - or buy more expensive things (they in no way need) to hoard. If salary had kept up with Production from the 60s, minimum wage wld be over $20 an hour now, but back then there was a 90% tax rate on income, so it wasn't worth it for the ppl who wrote the budgets & created the salary structures, to pay themselves at obscenely high percentages, while depressing workers wages, if some of that money was mostly going to taxes. But, when the GOP cut taxes, it effectively made it easier for CEOs and owners to pay themselves more & more $$$, while paying workers the same, or paying them even less in response to some GOP created economic crisis, like Dubya cutting finance regs to the point where the big banks nearly bankrupted our country, & caused massive unemployment.     We have more of a quadricated economy, really, actually, more divided than that. But, just at base, you have upper income, middle income, low income, and the destitute who live entirely on public assistance. You have lotsa stuff in-between too. Too often when we talk about bettering our economy, we concentrate on middle class tax cuts, rather than raising the bottom 90% up, by having a fair tax code, and fair distribution of profits, rather than most of it being funneled to the top 10%, esp the top 1%.\" ", "2019-03-23T14:32:24.000Z": "Deacon I liked her better when she was an Indian.

Today people well below the $116,000 range are paying WAY MORE than 7%. and wealthy are 30-40+%.

If you want a bigger wealth tax  just increase government spending  and the central bank won't need to print as much.

Someone really does need to follow the money and grab even hidden assets and give it all back to the American people starting with the poorest among the struggling Americans. Look at some of the people who are only on SSI  specifically singles who can't even get a car or buy a home. When you have disabled singles on SSI only who need more than just SSI alone but can't work  yes  those particular people are among the first to badly need resources after the homeless    What I think needs to happen is they need to go down the list of people with limited resources starting with the homeless and singles on SSI who are disabled and give each one in those groups hefty stimulus checks when they take money from the rich. I recall to stimulus checks when President Bush was in office before we had Obama. Rumor had it there was to be a third stimulus checks to all the Americans but when Obama came into office, it never happened so I guess he must've took it back when he set out to cut spending. Cutting spending in some areas was probably fine but it hurt in other areas where extra money was most needed, especially if there really was to be a third stimulus check to every American family    I think if you're even worth one mil or even half/3/4 of that, you should be targeted so America has enough money to survive. The Philthy Rich really need to learn to do with less so the rest of us have enough because many people don't. If you want to know why people are spending less, not having enough money has a lot to do with it and that's why some places are closing up shop. There was even an aquarium shop in our town years ago and that business also ended up closing because they weren't making it. Back then I didn't realize just how big the problem really was until now. Yes, someone really needs to grab the wealth because we really need a reasonable amount of wealth redistribution and I'm saying within reason. I don't say to steal it from seniors or the disabled who rightfully earned it or even inherited it as there's been so much estate theft it's not funny. Anytime wealth is wrongfully stolen from families especially when it affects those who most need resources, there is a serious problem. I think if someone gets into office who can redistribute wealth within reason, they should also go after thieves who've been stealing and start restoring victims and their families and giving back stolen money and assets to those from whom it was stolen no matter the SOL. There should be no SOL like there's not on murder    Even if Elizabeth Warren were to win, we don't know how well she'll do on other areas. We need godly counsel in all of our offices because this country needs to run God's way and one of them is restitution to theft victims.

Hell if you cut US military spending by 80% you could give the rich a tax cut.    Also off shore Tax Havens should be closed.

To get a better understanding of the why the middle class is struggling this is a good documentary to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m49vNjEGs  Money is power in politics and as long as the really rich can put as much money they want in to packs and lobbying not much will change.  If you want change vote for the crusader pushing this issue from day one and with the knowledge to change the system without adding loop holes, Elizabeth Warren is that person.    If you want more sweeping changes to how the US handle healthcare, education, economy and infrastructure then go with Bernie Sanders but I suspect Elizabeth Warren will add some of those as well to her 2020 bid for president but time will tell.    But be realistic that all politicians are pushed by the powers at bee and even if you vote one person in to the top that do want real change the ones bellow still will try to block change so make sure to vote the right politicians in to congress as well.    Many of the issues raised in the documentary is related to city issues when it come to real-estate investments, in more rural parts and small cities it's more an issue of well paying industry jobs requiring low level of education disappearing and moving overseas where cost of labor is low.  Automation have replaced about 70% of the work from the 80s so trying to get the few that remain back is not a way forward but with fewer well paying jobs in rural parts less money is used locally so you will see small local businesses struggle as well.  Back in the 80s you had big industries with a high percentage of it's expenses in salaries and the workers was using most of that money locally and small businesses was booming, how to move money this way today when well paying jobs have all but disappeared is not an easy question to answer.  Reeducation of the workforce is a possible future path forward but not all are made equal and how do you make a future for those that can't reeducate themselves at the level needed without them feeling out of place and useless (opioid crisis)?\" ", "steve harrigan": "Not a serious candidate.

To wit: CNN is owned by Warner Media. Warner Media is among the 4 (out of only 5) giant media monopolies in this country that have endorsed Warren and are backing her campaign. Meanwhile  Sanders has released a sweeping media reforms proposal that promises to put all these overpaid hacks out of a job  beginning with breaking up all of the media monopolies and ending with restoring actual journalistic integrity back to journalism.   Hence why they don't bother investigating. Otherwise, CNN would be telling you the facts: She's lying through her teeth when she says [her fake Native American heritage] never had anything to to do with getting a job.       The FACTS are that she registered with the Bar as a Native American and stayed so for 10 years.During that time, she bounced from U. Penn to Harvard and back twice as faculty, every single time being hired under Affirmative Action and touted by both universities as a \"\"person of color\"\" and a \"\"minority.\"\" She accepted multiple awards from prestigious law organizations such as the Fordham Law Review for being an outstanding \"\"person of color\"\" in law.       Similarly, Warren stands silent as CNN's anchors during the debate continue to attribute legislation written by Bernie Sanders and Pramila Jayapal (Medicare for All) to her as if it were her idea and as if she supported it- when it has been evident for months that she absolutely does not. Her own website failed to have any plan for health care whatsoever, but once it did, even in the vague neoliberal language it is clear as day that she absolutely is not talking about a single-payer, zero cost at the point of service health care plan- and very much plans to leave private insurance companies in the mix. This is NOT Medicare for All. Yet the whole mainstream media remains complicit in attributing Bernie's entire platform to Warren and she fully allows it, showing yet another extreme lack of integrity.       In addition to buying off the Working Families Party endorsement through her daughter and lobbyist campaign finance manager, Warren usurps Sanders in other ways, letting CNN, MSNBC, and others run pieces like Bernie's A Sexist!!; Bernie Hates Black People!!; Bernie Is Transphobic!! while saying nothing. And this is supposedly her long time friend. She failed to stand up for him in 2016 when it was crucial to the fate of the country. She fails to stand up for him now. She's running AGAINST him instead of supporting him, but claiming to share all his same values. If THIS is how she treats her friends, I'd hate to see how she is with the rest of us.       In short, she's full of shit. She's the establishment's anointed one. She's Obama 2.0. She's a Trojan horse for the Democrat establishment.

One of the reasons under capitalism that owners & execs get paid so much more than workers, is bc they will use that money to create more jobs, but if they're investing in foreign banks or expensive art etc, that money isn't creating a lotta jobs in the US.

So it makes sense to tax obscene wealth holdings at 2%, which is next to nothing for billionaires who have more money than they cld possibly need for any reason.\u00a0    A friend of mine is captain of a yacht of a wealthy scion, who spends his days boating around the FL Keyes, he doesn't work, he doesn't go into an office, he isn't bldg new businesses, or opening new factories, he's part of the leisure class. But why should there be a leisure class at all? While they live off profits created by workers in their corps, they themselves are not creating wealth, their existence creates very few jobs - servants, yacht crews, accountants, lawyers, stock brokers, investment bankers, that's about it. They don't run their companies, employees do that for them. Their daily existence barely stimulates the larger US economy. But they get to live lives of leisure, being able to afford anything they want, not having to work, how are they helping our economy?\" ", "Lilith Rogers": "Love you Elizabeth Warren!!

She honestly wants to make people's lives better.  She knows more about the dirty secrets of American corporations than most people alive.  Insurance companies  big pharma  Wall Street  and every other huge corporate interest in the world all shiver at the thought of having to coexist with her in the White House.

Even with obstructive Republican politics  making the American people understand the sickening level at which big money interests are corruptly controlling our politics to their advantage is crucial to the survival of the middle class.  Awareness is the first step in fighting for just and reasonable laws which limit the ability of corporations to rip off workers and consumers alike.  Warren is THE definite nightmare scenario for the greedy and the corrupt. They've gotten accustomed to working in a vacuum with the COMPLICITY of politicians who are also greedy and corrupt. The shake down of working class Americans by corporations and billionaires has gotten so bad that the disaffected even took a chance by voting for Donald Trump  hoping he would implement many of the same policy goals as Elizabeth Warren is planning.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        She originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which helped fund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren's plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken.    There is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make, with all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric. They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I have never seen a politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23 contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political rhetoric among leading Democrats.

", "craig owensby": "\"I\u2019m a Dem  and I totally support abortion rights  but I think we need to recognize that the abortion debate is a genuine moral argument.  People who believe that abortion is morally wrong are not empirically wrong.  It is not a right or wrong question. It will remain a matter of opinion forever!     So we need a new approach in order to de-partisanize the discussion.  The pro-lifers want to make it legally definitive that life begins at conception.  This is just as bad as saying that a fetus is nothing but some cells.      I do believe the Hyde amendment makes sense in that by having it in place, people can respect each other\u2019s legal rights, but on this uniquely difficult issue, at least they can say that their tax dollars are not paying to do something they may feel is an act of murder.      I don\u2019t believe it is, but that is my opinion, and I can respect the opinions of those who think otherwise.      So Biden agrees with me that federal funding for abortions is asking good people who oppose abortion to participate in the abortion through funding.  But, doesn\u2019t the government do all sorts of things like that?  For instance, any right to lifer must recognize that my opposition to the death penalty must be equally respected.  So, then if we don\u2019t use federal funds for abortions, we shouldn\u2019t use them for executions.  Fair is fair.      And how about war?  I am no anti-war pacifist, but the same moral imperative that drives someone against abortion COULD drive against war!  Wars result in the death of innocent people as anti-abortion believers claim abortion does.  So should I require that no federal dollars be used for war?    Ultimately, this is a complex issue, but the place to start is with respect.  I respect the anti-abortion moral position, so I understand Biden\u2019s position on the Hyde Bill.    Proposal:  Let\u2019s put into the tax form a donation option that asks if people want to donate any funds to provide abortions to low income people under federal laws, and let them give money to fund the federally administered private abortion assistance program, so that those who oppose abortion can know that their tax dollars won\u2019t fund abortions, while those who believe funding should be available can ensure it is.  This sort of opt-in approach can only be used on a very limited basis, but in this particular case, perhaps by showing our ability to respect a genuinely complex moral issue, we liberals can convince those who are driven by this matter to de-link it from clearly immoral GOP policies like support of the death penalty, anti-immigration, un-checked gun purchasing rights, and legalized racism, sexism and sexual identity discrimination.      Still, I think Warren is impressive!  I am genuinely split between her, Biden, Bernie, and Beto.  And Mayor Pete is also great, as is Harris.      We Dems have SIX super choices.

It was basic again when the country was recovering from WW2. Now  once again  our country is still recovering from a significant recession.

As we know the \"\"real\"\" answer requires a much more comprehensive approach. It can be as simple as honoring a contract that you've signed. It can be passing a minimum wage law that will actually allow the majority of people to live above the poverty line.

Warren   only   recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.    Unlike     Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the     General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor     fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to     bend on his policy stances once elected.    She originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.    Warren     worked to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which helped fund the ACA,    in  order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.    Unlike     Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the     60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.    Bernie     has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a     mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared    to  Warren.    Warren's     plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially     unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall     Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.    Warren voted twice     to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump,   which   appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,     Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several     Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.    Bernie     wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a     means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split     people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,     dismantle, and weaken.    There     is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make,   with   all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie     absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric.     They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only     candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you     want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans     you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I     have never seen a     politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the     political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a     small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23     contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary     of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most     popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political     rhetoric among leading Democrats.

And to me  she just keeps getting better. I agree  the Native American claim was a true blue gaffe (which was painful for me to hear as I am a woman of color) but luckily  I find  that she's been able to bury this 'issue' with ther whirlwind of policy proposals that she's taken on the road. It is true that Sanders popularized some of the agendas she's put forth  I think that's obvious to anyone who supports her  and those who support Sanders. I am more all-in on Warren  however  because she's got her plans laid out with fine print included\u2014 whereas Sanders needs his cheat sheet when challenged by Dana Bash to differentiate his policy of debt forgiveness from Warren's. I feel that although Sanders revived these ideas for a larger audience during his 2016 run  giving it the bare bones  Warren improved on it with muscle. I do believe that she (regardless of gender) is the best person to be president come 2020. Mind you  I do not have any glaring issues with Sanders\u2014 perhaps the DNC does  or the Democratic Party as a whole.      Another thing: We all know Sanders was cheated by the DNC for the nomination in 2016. We all know they overwhelming preferred Clinton. It was to be her coronation. Did you ever think that the DNC/Democratic Party did not, perhaps to this day, favor Sanders because he hasn't been a Democrat, but an Independent, until only when he's up for reelections, or Presidential bids? Warren, on the other hand, albeit progressive in ideology, has been a Democrat for the entirety of her political career. Perhaps the party could see in her someone who could be a more successful unifier within the Democrat Party as a whole. Warren's endorsement of Clinton was merely in keeping with party obligation, I think. She had been strongly critical of Clinton for her corporate ties before Warren was in politics. I think a Warren presidency would not be business as usual for Washington, and would certainly cause a sea change within the Democratic Party. Bernie Sanders eventually officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidency. We must remember that.      #1 Warren (is my hands-down favorite!); #2 Sanders (is my best compromise choice); #3 Harris (only because as a woman of color, I wouldn't mind seeing another woman of color in the highest office\u2014 she does not, to me at least, even as a Californian, have anything exciting going on about her as we all had once upon a time anticipated); #4 Booker + O'Rourke + Castro (all tied, and essentially the same guy to me if I closed my eyes, having seen all three of them at a San Francisco forum, all had the great ability to emotionally connect to their supporters\u2014 all do not have Warren's noggin); #5 Buttigieg (again, purely on identity politic purposes, and his youth\u2014 with experience and age, great things just might come from this guy)      Beating Trump just might be the easy part in all of this, it's getting over Biden that might be the toughest. He's got the party connections, he's got the name recognition, THE MONEY, the Obama mystique by osmosis (without which in '88 and '08 led to miserable bids of the presidency), and he's representative of the status quo\u2014 in these turbulent times, might seem very attractive, but electing a president should be a progression from, and not a regression to the Obama years, the last laurel in Biden's wreath. Every vote for the presidency should be a vote keeping in mind to moving things forward, not stopping and resetting and then moving on, we all don't have that much time! And I believe Warren has the bold 'big structural changes' needed to clean up the corruption in Washington, these gigantic industries that have monopolized their way into making themselves ubiquitous that it's now easier to live with them than to look for other choices, plus, a plethora of progressive policies to level the many inequalities in all strata of society.\" ", "Robert Schrader": "Chris Hayes is so sad that Bernie is losing.

Trump had the legal right to fire Comey and Mueller but instead he allowed the highly compromised special council to proceed. The crimes committed were committed by the Obama  Biden and Hillary Clinton administration. Hillary and the DNC paid for the phoney Russian doccier. All 17 members of the special council were Hillary Clinton supporters. And despite all of this criminality and conflict of Interests Trump fully cooperated with the investigation. Obama knew way before he left office   that Russia was attempting to influence the election  but Obama did nothing because he knew the Russians wanted Hillary to win as they had many deals lined up in her pay to play scams. Many Foreign countries were counting on a win for Hillary as they had contributed many millions to her campaign. Hillary had been selling America out for years and those Foreign nations that had benefitted   wanted her in the WH. As time goes by more and more evidence shows that MI6 and the Queen's Privy Council and the prime minister of Australia and others in the 5 eyes  were also complicit in the attempted coup of our duly elected president.

Everything she says is truth. I'm surprised at Anderson's dismissal of the need for impeachment. To put 'table top' issues ahead of the  destruction of democracy....it blows my mind!         Barr and Trump both need to be removed and their place in history solidly shown as crooks and cons. Barr has a special place in history as an unmoral, unethical man. This isn't the first time he's protected a President from consequences of their breaking the law. He was behind the protection of Reagan and Bush during the Iran Contra conflict.         Mitch McConnell is also involved with ex-KGB Russian oligarchs, apparent in the huge aluminum plant in his home state, Kentucky. He is indebted and influenced by the same people that sought to corrupt our elections! THEY ALL ARE CRIMINALS THAT SHOULD BE LOCKED UP! The Constitution is being tested and tried right now! ,And if we do nothing, they win. We are already on our way to a fashist oligarchy with the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few. These lobby influence in Congress to take more protections away from average citizens and workers! They take away Unions, which are the only way American tradesmen are able to have benefits and protections from unfair firings and unhealthy work conditions. They lobby to take away protections from unsafe pharmicuticals and other products. They seek to limit damages for citizens whose loved ones are killed or hurt, knowingly, by the money machines.         You Republicans that wave the flag so readily but don't understand that people died in the horrors of war to stop exactly this kind of behavior! Stop listening to Fox news and look at the evidence!     I agree with Elizabeth Warren, when all this evidence comes out, Republicans will be made to sign off on and CHOOSE corruption or the Constitution's very wise prohibitions. This is a moment in history that will determine whether we live under a Democract Republic or  something akin to Dictatorship.

Fake clouds, fake mist in these sprinkle that they are sprinkling us with today.Those fake rains are toxic for us. Wear hoodies and use umbrellas no matter how light the rain might be, these acid rain clouds are toxic for us and I believe are the cause of cancer and other illnesses today.   Look up the YouTube video of a scientist who has been recording the North Pole ice caps melting for 35 years from a glacier down to an ice cube and down to nothing. The United States of America and the world is flooding. YouTube it. People from around the U.S. and the world are recording it and posting it.   Look up the lawsuits around the world that common folks are starting to sue th companies that PROFIT from creating these clouds. YouTube: \"\" We are suing these B@stards\"\" it is not misspelled. You'll see that common folk are suing, thank God people are fighting back. YouTube video from \"\"Anonymous\"\" on these fake clouds. They say they are controlling the weather, really! Well we can PROVE we we're fine before geoengineered clouds, stop your lies. Look at these fires alone, they are creating mass destruction due to their GREED.    I know a lot because I am a cancer survivor. I beat cancer naturally (including 3 blood transfusion). I studied cancer for 5 years and eventually beat it. Thank God.   I know what I know by default because I wanted to live and not do Chemotherapy and managed to survive.   I know that they have the cure for most cancers in 45 days but the FDA won't approve it because they SAY THEY WANT MORE TRIALS, MEANWHILE people are dying like flies from cancer. Do you know what a 45 day cure would have done for me? I wouldn't have lost almost 12 years of my life trying to cure myself and recoup from being sick for 7 years with cancer. I wouldn't have lost my house and my successful trucking business. Look up the \"\"Vice\"\" show \"\" the new cancer cure\"\" something a long that title. They show a man who has stage 4 brain Cancer- and get rid of it within 45 days. Brain Cancer- is one of the hardest Cancers because the Brain is on a different lymphatic system than the rest of our body. John McCain died of brain Cancer- served our country and not even he was privy to the stem cell cure, not even on a trail basis. Wouldn't you be mad if you or a loved one had cancer and was dying and you KNEW there was an easier way or a less TOXIC way to curing cancer than going the chemotherapy route which is a horrendous route to take. Yet the FDA APPROVES TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR FOOD AND YET ALL WE TALK ABOUT ON THE NEWS IS FAKE NEWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP...SHAME ON ALL YOU AMERICANS WHO ARE SLEEPING. WATCHING A STRAIGHT UP PUPPET SHOW AND WE ARE ALL TOO OLD FOR IT, YET THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING. MEANWHILE WE ARE LIGHTING UP LIKE A MATCH!! and all everyone want to do is be on social or watch fake news.   There's a lot of ways to make a difference rather than posting here on things you know nothing about. I'm an older woman and I fight for my children, my grandchildren and the young people who are dying with cancer in unprecedented numbers. I fight the Medical system that pumping opiates to the AMERICAN public for injuries,  depression, someone going through a divorce or something (when years ago the doctors prescribed counselors and Psychotherapy of some kind and not opiates) for attention span deficit disorder they prescribe Ritalin  (look up the side affects of that on a child). My daughter when she was 10 years old was  recommended that by the psychologist and her teacher in her elementary school and I refused. I was 28 years old at the time and I laughed and said \"\"absolutely not\"\"!!! I told them \"\" you aren't getting my daughter on drugs cuz you have too many kids. They said my daughter isn't focused and she gets off her seat and visits her classmates. I told them my daughter is a social butterfly and I will talk to her about  that but you aren't drugging up my daughter and turning her into a zombie cuz you can't handle your class. Today my daughter owns a successful Beauty salon in Los Angeles and If I would have listen to them my daughter would be strung out on drugs or Dead by an overdose. She is 40 years old now.   I'm not asleep, never have been since I was a child. God has blessed me with knowledge and foresight on issues that affect us today. It is a gift and a blessing.   Wake up, before you are knee deep in the murky Waters or your house is on fire literally. Come on the Amazon Forrest is on fire and we can't afford for that to happen.   The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, we have got to try and stop the crooks from killing us and doing us in just for PROFIT. They are a bunch of old Crocks and on their way out. Watch the movie \"\"All the money in the world\"\" you'll understand the mindset of the rich sick old Crocks that would slice their own mother's throat for profit.

Bernie      has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was   a    mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance   compared   to  Warren.    Warren's      plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially      unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall      Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.    Warren voted twice      to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump,    which   appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,      Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several      Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.    Bernie      wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a      means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split      people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,      dismantle, and weaken.    There      is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make,    with   all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie      absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric.      They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only      candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you      want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's   plans    you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country,   and I    have never   seen a    politician who can rally young people and apathetic people   into the    political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was   nothing but a    small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on   to win 23    contests against the establishment backed former First   Lady, Secretary    of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably   one of the most    popular politicians in America, and he has changed   the political    rhetoric among leading Democrats. Just look at the   incredibly    influential organizations that stemmed out of his 2016   campaign:    Justice Democrats    Brand New Congress    Our Revolution\" ", "Lynda Brown": "I think she needs another beer.

Bernie did not vote for Ben Carsen on the 1st go round.   2) Warren admitted the DNC rigged the primary for Hillary 2016 on CNN. Days later she said she misspoke, and it was not rigged.  3) Warren does not want to eliminate medical debt. Bernie does want to eliminate medical debt.   4) Warren does not want to eliminate total student loan debt. Bernie does want to eliminate student loan debt.   5) Warren voted for Trump\u2019s bloated military budget (beyond what the Pentagon wanted). Bernie did not vote for it.   6) Also, Warren has raised money for the military-industrial complex and done favors for them such as Raytheon. Bernie has not raised money nor done favors for the military-industrial complex.   7) Warren flip-flopped on the intricate development of Medicare for All to allow privatization (corporations) to be involved and make a profit. There is no single-payer in her lesser developed bill, and the phrase noted \u201cincreased access\u201d, is code for privatization. Bernie\u2019s MED4ALL bill is \u201csingle-payer\u201d.  8) Warren stated she won\u2019t take big money in the Primary to win over Progressives that do not want their candidate under the sway of corporations and foreign money to ensure the People. Yet, she lied and transferred $10.4M into her Presidential campaign from what she gathered previously over the years in a prelude to her Presidential run. She lied in a scrupulous and devious manner after giving the people her word (of taking no big money)  9) Warren also stated she will take big corporate money after the Primary once everything is locked in. That is why she is courting big money behind the scenes and doing fundraisers for the DNC now.   10) Warren did not endorse the progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 when he was running. This happened when it was rumored that she would pick up the VP position with Hillary. They did that to push Warren out of the way. They talked her out of her principles easily.   11) She lied about her ancestry numerous times and brought shame to herself.

These moderates the Dems are panicking about make up 5% of the electorate, that's how much Spanky won by in the key blue wall states. In 2018, the midterms had an 11% increase in voter participation, esp by the groups the Dems have always taken for granted, progressives, college students, lgbt ppl, poor ppl, POC. As 2018 showed, these populations are more likely to vote if you give them candidates to voter FOR rather than expecting them to vote against the Republicans.\u00a0    The Dems always think they can throw us a couple bones, while they pant at the feet of the moderates - but the truth is, when ppl aren't excited to vote, with election day on a work day, and a school day, and many Dem voters face massive GOP voter suppression efforts, it's easy to stay home on election day. Spanky's cult is motivated, GOP voters in general turn out for elections, so most of that 11% uptick in '18 were Dems who don't normally vote. Giving up 11% to catch 5% is stupid, it's doubly stupid considering that same 5% wanted Bernie over Hillary. Nominate Biden, you're already down 16%. Nominate Warren, and you're up by 16%. Biden is only polling well bc of name recognition, bc the media is pushing him, & bc of the populations who usually get polled.

And if you doubt the very similar vocal patterns,\u00a0listen\u00a0to this\u00a0clip\u00a0of Laura Ingraham comparing Elizabeth Warren's rants with those of Ruth Buzzi.

Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken.

The US oil and gas industry\u2019s total employment impact to the national economy in 2015, combining operational and capital investment impacts, amounted to 10.3 million full-time and part-time jobs and accounted for 5.6% of total US employment, according to a study commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute and conducted by PwC LLP.  And remember every kilowatt of wind and solar power you install HAS to be backed up by a 24/7/365 power generating system because wind and solar can not be relied on . And wind energy , even after more than 200 billion dollars has been invested it only supplies about 2-3% of USA electricity requirements .   This a fact !  And the only 24/7/365  power generating systems available now are gas,Coal, geothermal,hydro and Nuclear . Hydro is very limited and also very destructive . Geothermal is also very limited. Pumped Hydro storage is good but very expensive and also limited in capacity and available areas . Nuclear is of course ideal and ultimately will be the future especially if Fusion is perfected .

For one she claims she is against big money in politics influencing politicians (corruption)  and yet she said she plans to take corporate pac money in the general election against trump if she becomes the democratic nominee. Do you see the hypocritical nature of that? How can you be trusted to fight against the corruption in politics (large amounts of money being given by corporations to politicians to support an agenda of the corporations)  when you say you will take big money from corporations yourself? So she says she\u2019s against corruption but she is okay with participating in the corruption herself. She also said she is for making cuts to military spending  and yet she voted in favor of trump\u2019s military budget increase... does that support her claim of being for military cuts? Warren signed on in support of Medicare for all in 2017 when it was deemed popular to do so  while Bernie has been preaching and fighting for a single payer health care system in America for 40+ years even when it wasn\u2019t seen as a popular belief in America. Warren was a registered Republican until she was 47  so her views seem to change and her consistency is lacking which is problematic. There\u2019s a reason Warren is being propped up by major news outlets  she is seen as less of a threat to the current system then Bernie is. While Warren isn\u2019t terrible  if she is elected I suspect she won\u2019t fight very hard for medicare for all  and that is something that should be concerning for people whom want to finally join other major countries around the world in guaranteeing their citizens healthcare in a government run system  such as Canada  Germany  United Kingdom  France  Denmark  Spain  Sweden  Finland  Italy... the list goes on.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.  her answer to NYT has put big question mark over all her claims on medicare for all : https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-candidate-interviews.html          Bernie sanders is very strong on israel and use aid as leverage to make them sign peace instead of taking US to start new wars   Warren is very weak on israel,  watch link above, her response on Israel was disgusting           Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the  General election.   Warren has said she would only do small donor  fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.          Bernie has army bigger than US military (2 millions Volunteer ) which are united and get together for any purposes to let him push his policy.   Warren does not have the left support as Bernie has, so she may face issue pursuing her agenda after getting to power.           Third concern, I feel in debates, Warren will be crashed by Donald, you know the guy has no principles           She originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.          Warren is progressive with playing lots of dirty politics, , I do not consider her as honest person.Her biggest problem to me is her general trait of playing politics as she did in 2016 by supporting Hillary. what sets her apart from Bernie is her lack of support and playing politics.           Warren worked to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which helped fund the ACA,  in  order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.          Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s.   Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.          Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared  to  Warren.          Warren's plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially  unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall  Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.          Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which  appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,  Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.              Bernie wants to cancel all student debt,   Warren wants to implement a  means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split  people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,  dismantle, and weaken.          There is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make, with all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie  absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric. They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only  candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you  want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans  you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I have never seen a  politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the  political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a  small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23  contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary  of State, and Senator of New York.

Warren    only   recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.    Unlike      Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the      General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor      fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to      bend on his policy stances once elected.    She originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.    Warren      worked to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which helped fund the ACA,     in  order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.    Unlike      Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to   the    60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.    Bernie      has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was   a    mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance   compared   to  Warren.    Warren's      plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially      unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall      Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.    Warren voted twice      to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump,    which   appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,      Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several      Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.    Bernie      wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a      means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split      people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,      dismantle, and weaken.    There      is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make,    with   all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie      absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric.      They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only      candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you      want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's   plans    you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country,   and I    have never   seen a    politician who can rally young people and apathetic people   into the    political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was   nothing but a    small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on   to win 23    contests against the establishment backed former First   Lady, Secretary    of State, and Senator of New York.

For one she claims she is against big money in politics influencing politicians (corruption)  and yet she said she plans to take corporate pac money in the general election against trump if she becomes the democratic nominee. Do you see the hypocritical nature of that? How can you be trusted to fight against the corruption in politics (large amounts of money being given by corporations to politicians to support an agenda of the corporations)  when you say you will take big money from corporations yourself? So she says she\u2019s against corruption but she is okay with participating in the corruption herself. She also said she is for making cuts to military spending  and yet she voted in favor of trump\u2019s military budget increase... does that support her claim of being for military cuts? Warren signed on in support of Medicare for all in 2017 when it was deemed popular to do so  while Bernie has been preaching and fighting for a single payer health care system in America for 40+ years even when it wasn\u2019t seen as a popular belief in America. Warren was a registered Republican until she was 47  so her views seem to change and her consistency is lacking which is problematic. There\u2019s a reason Warren is being propped up by major news outlets  she is seen as less of a threat to the current system then Bernie is. While Warren isn\u2019t terrible  if she is elected I suspect she won\u2019t fight very hard for medicare for all  and that is something that should be concerning for people whom want to finally join other major countries around the world in guaranteeing their citizens healthcare in a government run system  such as Canada  Germany  United Kingdom  France  Denmark  Spain  Sweden  Finland  Italy... the list goes on.

Stop living in the past, embrace new technologies, especially for energy production (cole mining is not the answer).     I must say that California is doing some great things in this area. People say a lot of bad things about China when it comes to the environment, but they're making way bigger steps to fix the problems. For example; they got 400.000 electric buses  driving around.

Do you know that if you were to tax all of the private equity funds profits - and/or those that go to their top executives and managers - even at 90%.....it would amount to a hill of beans compared to the increased tax revenue that the recent tax cuts - the corporate tax cuts in particular - has brought in.  The problem is not that rich people make a lot.  That has always been the case.  (THE PROBLEM is that the government SPENDS TOO MUCH.  Our deficit is NOT $22 trillion.  Because that number does not include the over $90 trillion that the Federal Government's General Fund has borrowed from the Social Security and Medicare Taxes we have been paying since FDR's days.)  So Sen. Warren is not stupid.  She is married to a Harvard elite professor and has taught at Harvard herself.  She knows this proposal does not amount to anything in terms of money.  It's pure class warfare.  And if she WAS to go after Private equity funds/Wall St. profits and compensation of their execs?    They will just move operations out of the country, where they can't be so heavily regulated.  Unless Warren decides to make foreign investment in the U.S. illegal.  Oops, just one problem with that.  The U. S.'s liquididty lifeline and ability to sell debt to finance it's sky-high deficits depends on being able to sell debt (U.S. Treasury Securities) to foreign investors.  And if you rule THAT out?  Well where is the money going to come from for Medicare for all, free college education for all, and college loan debt being paid off by the Federal government?  You couldn't raise enough money if you taxed EVERYONE - rich, middle, poor and every business - to pay for all of that.

Warren only   recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.    Unlike   Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the   General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor   fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to   bend on his policy stances once elected.    Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.    Warren   worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would   have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device   Industry in her state.    Unlike   Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the   60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.    Bernie   has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a   mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to   Warren.    Warren voted twice   to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which   appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,   Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several   Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.    Bernie   wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a   means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split   people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,   dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a   universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very   unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.    There   is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make, with   all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie   absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric.   They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only   candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed. If you   want to implement even a fraction of either Warren's or Bernie's plans   you need a radical change in voter engagement in this country, and I   have never seen a   politician who can rally young people and apathetic people into the   political process as well as Bernie has. In 2015 he was nothing but a   small Independent Senator from Vermont, and he went on to win 23   contests against the establishment backed former First Lady, Secretary   of State, and Senator of New York. Now he is arguably one of the most   popular politicians in America, and he has changed the political   rhetoric among leading Democrats.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

As a result, Harvard became ACCOMPLICES to her CRIME.  And along with Warren, they should be PROSECUTED.

The doctors can\u2019t explain it, they are baffled. The radiologist actually thought he had the wrong patient\u2019s scan and asked the oncologist what on earth my Dad was taking. We told everyone....LDN!!! There is no other explanation to this medical miracle!!!\u201d      \u201cI Have been on LDN for 2 months for primary progressive MS. For the past year and a half, I have been nearly blind. I would put on a pair of 2.75 reading glasses, then put a second pair of 3.25 on top of that. LDN has restored my vision and I couldn\u2019t be more excited, as I\u2019m driving again.\u201d      \u201cMy dad has been using LDN for PD since October 2004 with great success. I have started a Yahoo Group called \u2018Healing Parkinsons\u2019.\u201d      \u201cI have had Crohn\u2019s for 30 years (progressed after surgery) and have been unsuccessful with many treatments until now. I refused to go on Remicade or Humira because I feared the extreme side effects. LDN provided me with reduction of symptoms on the first day!\u201d      \u201cI was diagnosed with SPMS and transverse myelitis and the first 8 months used Betaseron and in those first 8 months I went from using a walker, wheelchair to a Hoveround power chair. Then I started taking LDN and now I don\u2019t have to use anything to help me walk or get around.\u201d      \u201cThe foot-long fistula (think of it as a really deep ulcer) that was connecting my small intestine to my colon is gone! My last colonoscopy was in February and in the three months of being on LDN, it healed.\u201d      \u201cI have scleroderma, CREST syndrome and have been on LDN for almost 15 months. I also have Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, and fibromyalgia. I have to say that within a week of starting LDN, I felt like I had my life back.\u201d    https://www.drshiller.com/healing-neuropathy-ldn-functional-medicine/    What\u2019s is LDN, and why did I prescribe it for her?  LDN is a medication that is very unusual.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t work the way most drugs work.  It evokes the natural intelligence in the body.  Naltrexone blocks the opioid system of the body.\u00a0 In high dose, it can help a heroin addict stay clean, because they can\u2019t get high.  In very low doses, (hence the name low dose naltrexone, or LDN), it tricks the body to produce  more of its own natural pain blocking chemicals called endorphins and enkephalins.  Some of these natural\u00a0 molecules modulate the immune system.\u00a0 LDN has been shown to reduce the level of inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines.  That\u2019s why research suggests that LDN\u00a0 is helpful in many chronic pain states, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and other chronic illnesses.  So she started LDN. We do it at low low dose initially.\u00a0 She called me when she had been on the therapeutic dose for about 2 weeks.\u00a0 The burning pain was gone. She still had aching in her joints but it was tolerable.  So what does that mean?\u00a0 Did LDN work only partially?  This is very important  So pay close attention.  She hadn\u2019t been on it long enough to know.  LDN, as I said, stimulates the body\u2019s own pain blocking chemicals, and it reduces low grade inflammation that can cause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.\" ", "Progressive Humanist": "\"I have \"\"good/great health insurance\"\"; I'm still in debt for thousands of dollars for an operation I needed almost a decade ago for a congenital condition.\" ", "jai ibvr": "\"Warren dont get jack  lieing dack of deception.\" ", "J V": "people go broke because they are bad with money ", "James Dean": "\"Lovely woman  smart  direct and has already done A TON of work by scrutinizing big corporations  banks and corrupt CEOs.\" ", "Miles Franklin": "\"Healthcare is like the roads everyone can drive on  the water everyone drinks.

Besides saving $800 billion/year  it raises net profits  raises net wages  lowers prices and unilaterally addresses tax havens[5 6]. It may be viewed as an economic check against excessive State and Federal spending  i.e. the financial sector would raise lending rates for Federal government funding (bond yields) to mitigate the risk of APT tax rate hikes on dollar liquidity flows that may result from lower Federal tax revenues (due to excessive price inflation in communities across the country). Those higher interest rates would boost ROI for risk-free portfolios in pension funds  401K's and the entire SS Trust Fund  as well as bring down housing prices for conscientious savers and increase financial stability.

It's part of your \"\"act\"\" where you try to act like \"\"the people\"\" just like when you opened that beer and now you're trying to relate to Christian people.  You can't believe in aborting the unborn and be a real person of the Christian faith.      Question: \"\"Is abortion murder?\"\"    Answer:\u00a0The subject of\u00a0abortion\u00a0is perhaps one of the most highly charged issues of our day. Finding an honest answer to the question \u201cis abortion murder?\u201d takes courage for those who have performed abortions or\u00a0have had abortions\u00a0themselves. The Bible is clear about the fact that murder is wrong (Exodus 20:13). However, in some cases, the Bible does not forbid killing. Soldiers representing their country were expected to kill soldiers on the opposing side (Joshua 11:20). That is not murder. Animals were killed for food and for sacrifice (Exodus 24:5;\u00a0Genesis 9:3\u20134). That is not murder either.    Murder is defined as \u201cthe unlawful, premeditated killing of one human being by another.\u201d Murder is unlawful killing\u2014that is, killing that is done by the judgment of one human being against another, for personal (rather than national) reasons. The Bible condemns murder repeatedly as a characteristic of a wicked society (Deuteronomy 5:17;\u00a0Isaiah 1:21;\u00a0Hosea 4:2;\u00a0Matthew 5:21). Determining whether or not abortion is murder involves two considerations: first, whether or not a fetus in utero is actually a human being, and, second, if a fetus is a child, whether or not abortion can be rightly called murder since it is legal in most countries. If murder is unlawful killing, it would follow that a lawful killing would not be murder.    One reason murder is outlawed in many places is that it is unethical for one person to unilaterally decide the fate of another. Under the Old Testament Law, a murderer was not put to death unless there were multiple witnesses: \u201cNo person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness\u201d (Numbers 35:30). In war, soldiers do not decide to kill for their own purposes; rather, they kill in the national interest\u2014if they fight for an honorable nation, the national interest will be to protect innocent civilians from some threat. Abortion is different. Abortion is killing based on a mother\u2019s unilateral judgment and choice. Such unprovoked killing of the defenseless is unethical and should define abortion as murder in any society\u2014unless the fetus is not human. If the fetus is just a mass of impersonal tissue or something less than human, ending its life would not face the same ethical challenge and would not be considered murder.    So, is a fetus a human? Or is it something else? Biologically speaking,\u00a0human life begins at conception. When the mother\u2019s egg and the father\u2019s sperm come together, they combine and create a new string of DNA that is personalized and totally unique. DNA is coded information, the blueprint for the new human\u2019s growth and development. No more genetic material needs to be added; the zygote in the womb is as human as the mother in whose womb it dwells. The difference between a fetus and any one of us is one of age, location, and level of dependence. When a mother aborts the process of fetal development, she is destroying a unique life.    The Bible clearly points to conception as the beginning of human life. Samson said, \u201cI have been a Nazirite to God from my mother\u2019s womb\u201d (Judges 16:17). He refers to his unborn self as having already been what God planned him to be\u2014a Nazirite. David says, \u201cYou formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother\u2019s womb\u201d (Psalm 139:13). Again, we see David referring to himself as a person in the womb. Then, he says, \u201cYour eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them\u201d (Psalm 139:16). David is saying that God had all of his days planned out for him while he was still in the womb. Again, this evidence points to personhood beginning at conception, rather than at the moment of birth. We see God had a similar plan for the life of the pre-born Jeremiah: \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations\u201d (Jeremiah 1:5).    The Bible considers a fetus to be an unborn child, a planned human being that God is forming from the moment of conception. This being the case, it doesn\u2019t really matter what human jurisprudence says or how socially or politically acceptable abortion is. God\u2019s law takes precedence. A mother who decides to abort her child is unilaterally making a decision to end another person\u2019s life\u2014and that is and always has been the definition of murder.\" ", "Patrick McCarthy": "Warren is a loser.

Warren   only   recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.    Unlike     Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the     General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor     fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to     bend on his policy stances once elected.    She originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.    Warren     worked to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which helped fund the ACA,    in  order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.    Unlike     Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the     60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.    Bernie     has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a     mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared    to  Warren.    Warren's     plan to fund her policies through a wealth tax is potentially     unconstitutional, therefore harder to implement than Bernie's Wall     Street speculation tax and higher income taxes on wealthy entities.    Warren voted twice     to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump,   which   appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons,     Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several     Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.    Bernie     wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a     means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split     people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack,     dismantle, and weaken.    There     is also a more nuanced distinction between them I'd like to make,   with   all the political differences aside. The one area I think Bernie     absolutely dominates where Warren doesn't, is with rhetoric.     They both are offering tons of plans, but to me Bernie is the only     candidate with a strong message of how it will all be executed.

Watch as Carol Swain  professor of political science at Vanderbilt University  shares the inconvenient history of the Democratic Party.\u201d      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_a7dQXilCo&t=4s  (Youtube title:  The Inconvenient Truth About the Democratic Party)   Script  by  African American Professor Carol Swain:     When you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind? The Republicans? Or, the Democrats?     Most people would probably say the Democrats. But this answer is incorrect.     Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination.     The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed Reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynchings, and fought against the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s.     In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it entirely. This effort, however, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. In the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, the court ruled that slaves aren\u2019t citizens; they\u2019re property. The seven justices who voted in favor of slavery? All Democrats. The two justices who dissented? Both Republicans.       The slavery question was, of course, ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war. The commander-in-chief during that war was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln \u2013 the man who freed the slaves.       Six days after the Confederate army surrendered, John Wilkes Booth, a Democrat, assassinated President Lincoln. Lincoln\u2019s vice president, a Democrat named Andrew Johnson, assumed the presidency. But Johnson adamantly opposed Lincoln\u2019s plan to integrate the newly freed slaves into the South\u2019s economic and social order.       Johnson and the Democratic Party were unified in their opposition to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which gave blacks citizenship; and the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the vote. All three passed only because of universal Republican support.       During the era of Reconstruction, federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for the newly freed slaves. Hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as Republicans, and 22 black Republicans served in the US Congress by 1900. The Democrats did not elect a black man to Congress until 1935.      But after Reconstruction ended, when the federal troops went home, Democrats roared back into power in the South. They quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with measures like black codes \u2013 laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run businesses. And they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests, used to subvert the black citizen\u2019s right to vote.     And how was all of this enforced? By terror -- much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, founded by a Democrat, Nathan Bedford Forrest.       As historian Eric Foner - himself a Democrat - notes: \u201cIn effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.\u201d     For the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/inconv...\" ", "Nik kaka8": "ayayai yayai cringe ", "Susan Fordt-Blanchard": "What about Big Mike first man...to late Pocahontas already done like you......

Over a span of 16 years  he continuously won re-election by larger margins  with the only exception being 1994.        He sided with the minority in voting against the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002. He also opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.        Voted against the Patriot Act despite the majority of Congress voting for it (357 to 66). He also sponsored several amendments trying to limit its effects, even getting a proposal passed through the House preventing the government from obtaining a record of the books people buy.        He passed more amendments than any other member during his time in the House. It earned him the nickname \u201cThe Amendment King.\u201d He did this despite being a \u201csocialist\u201d and Congress being controlled by Republicans from 1994 to 2006, in one of the most partisan right-wing Houses ever.        Passed an amendment to \u201crequire offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white collar crime to give appropriate notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution.\u201d            Passed an amendment that improved Postsecondary Education. It administered a competitive grant program to institutions of higher education seeking to reduce costs through the purchase of goods and services. This saved colleges and taxpayers both money.        He expanded free health care and won a $100 million increase in funding by using his amendment powers. This added community health centers that gave out a variety of free health care services.        Prevented child labor by passing an amendment to a general appropriations bill. This stated that the U.S. will not appropriate funds for the importation of goods made by the hands of minors.        Won a $22 million increase for low-income home energy assistance and a related weatherization assistance program. This helped heat homes for the poor.        Received the distinction of being named the third-most popular senator in the country, according to Public Policy Polling in August 2011.        Given a score of 100 percent by the NAACP and NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) based on his record during his time in the Senate.        Named one of the top 5 American Jews of the Forward 50 in 2015.        Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs in 2013-2014.        Passed an amendment making sure that solar water heaters provide at least 30 percent of hot water for new federal buildings. This is forcing us to use green energy.        Made sure to it that bailout funds weren\u2019t used to replace laid-off U.S. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers.        Helped ensure that child care was being offered to parents in the Armed Forces by requiring the Comptroller General to provide accurate reporting on what was being done.        Required a public database be made available showing the names of senior Department officials seeking employment with defense contractors. This helped crack down on corruption.        Required that the TRICARE program provide treatment to veterans affected by certain types of autism. It wasn\u2019t previously being done.        Was praised by John McCain(R-AZ) and Sen. Jack Reed(D-RI) for overhauling the Veterans Administration.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Instead  it just means that our taxes go toward paying for health insurance so that 100% of Americans have access to any healthcare they want.

It would save consumers a lot of money because there would no longer be out of pockets costs  no more premiums or co-pays  no healthcare fees  etc. The plan does require more federal revenue  yes. In the long run it saves a lot of money because if healthcare is funded by a single source  that single source will want to keep it as cheap as possible; administrative and all for-profit costs will be eliminated. Most importantly  it means no more medical bankruptcies. No financial headaches. No more being forced to stay at a job to keep insurance. No more wondering whether your expensive insurance even covers what you need. It will save everyone a lot of money  which in turn will be more efficient and boost the economy. Additionally  if employers/companies no longer provide private insurance plans  they will save money that can boost wages  expand business  etc.     If this was government controlled healthcare decisions, I would oppose it. It's not though; this plan guarantees that all Americans still get freedom in their healthcare choices. If anything, it makes us freer by allowing us more choices at no cost out of pocket. Lives will be saved, people will be healthier, and Americans will save a lot of money. By the way, the medicare for all plan is a LOT better than the systems in Canada and the UK.

The sad truth is that despite his love for all people not all people benefit from his love. Why? The reason is because they refuse to stand in a righteous relationship with Jesus Christ. Warren should know that a relationship is based on reciprocal love. It means very little when He loves sinners (Luke 19:10) but they don't want to love Him (John 14:15). So  what does that tell us? It tells us that Warren is not only pro LGBTQ but also that she supports marriages where one of the spouses refuses to love the other whilst the other dearly loves his or her spouse. Warren is surely a strange critter. By the way I am not a Trump fan. He is even worse.    Jesus did not die for us because we are precious and worthy of his sacrifice on the cross.

My kids went to public school too. (Her kids went to private school).    6. Her family's Native American Recipes that she published were plagiarized from other's recipe books.    7. On her Texas Bar Registration she listed herself as a minority Native American.    8. When she applied to Harvard to be a Professor she touted herself as the first woman of color in that program.    Getting the drift here? When she started the lie about Bernie allegedly telling her that a woman couldn't get elected as President, she used CNN to get it out there and then walked away like she was the victim. One of her common tactics by the way. And then she claims the meeting where Sanders allegedly said what he said was in a room with only Bernie and her. She's learning because she gets caught lying so often that she made sure there were no witnesses. Pathetic !    Those are just a few of the ongoing lies that this woman has told and continues to tell on a daily basis.  And with all of that public knowledte, the DM Register endorses her?  That in and of itself is a joke.  The article said that \"\"she\"\" (Warren) believes that healthcare is a right.  Well, we all believe healthcare is a right.  No one is saying that you can't have healthcare.  You just have to select what you can afford.  Same with College tuition.  Education is a right.  Agreed.  You have the right to go to whatever higher education institute you want to.  Just be sure you can afford it.  Healthcare, Tuition and a host of other things SHOULD NOT fall on the backs of taxpayers.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS have a path to citizenship if they want one.

In 1997  she was named Harvard\u2019s first woman of color by the Fordham Law Review. In 2010  Warren told a story of racism and discrimination within her own family. Two months ahead of her announcement she would be running for president  Warren decided she was going to prove once and for all she was telling the truth and that the Cherokee tribe was truly part of her story.

Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.

Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.

On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

The study concluded, after the money was used, that it was inconclusive which one he said. \u263a I'm not joking. They could have called him and simply asked him, at the time.

This kind of spending has wasted more people's money, than what a wealth tax could replace. Yet, the billionaires are to blame that the government needs more money?     I can see that the companies should pay more for labor, yet it's also important to remember the profits of companies are distributed to anyone who buys stocks and anyone can do this for publicly owned companies like Amazon. Some companies also provide good prices to consumers which helps people afford to buy stuff easier which is essentially distributing wealth, too.    Also, with phone apps people can easily buy and sell stock to share in some of the profits themselves. Anyone can own some of the public companies, too. There are apps like Robbinhood, which gives a free stock to get started and don't charge commission fees.

Elizabeth Warren is now being treated like the   frontrunner by her opponents. The second big takeaway is that the   candidates\u2019 angle of attack on Warren, together with her dismal   performance under pressure, should have Democrats very worried that   Warren could be their candidate in the general election in 2020.    Warren was taken to task during the debate for evading basic questions about   how she would pay for her signature Medicare-for-all health-care plan,   and how she would implement her controversial\u2014and constitutionally   dubious\u2014wealth tax. For a candidate who brags about having a policy plan   for everything, it didn\u2019t look good.    Sen. Amy Klobuchar called Warren\u2019s health-care plan a \u201cpipe dream\u201d and offered her a \u201creality   check\u201d on her wealth tax, attacks that were echoed and reinforced by the   other candidates throughout the night. When Mayor Pete Buttigieg asked   Warren, \u201cyes or no,\u201d whether her Medicare-for-all plan would raise taxes   on the middle class, Warren hemmed and hawed, talked about her   \u201cprinciples,\u201d and evaded giving a yes or no answer.    Buttigieg and others seized on this, calling into question Warren\u2019s trustworthiness.   When Sen. Bernie Sanders jumped in to explain that his universal   health-care plan would increase taxes, Klobuchar and Buttigieg noted   that at least Sanders was being honest and straightforward about his   plan. Through it all, Warren seemed defensive and taken aback that her   fellow candidates were coming after her like this.    The reason all this should concern Democrats is that if Warren can\u2019t handle pointed   questions about basic aspects of her major policy proposals in a primary   debate, how is she going to weather the storms of the general election?   If she can\u2019t bring herself to admit that Medicare-for-all will mean   higher taxes for everyone, which it certainly will, how will general   election voters already skeptical of Washington be persuaded to trust   her?    Trump won a crowed GOP primary in 2016 in part by saying   things no other candidate was willing to say and putting himself forward   as an honest outsider who tells it like it is. If Democrats want to put   someone up against Trump who can beat him at this game, their candidate   had better have a credible answer for how he or she will pay for a $32   trillion program that\u2019s steadily losing support. The most recent poll   from the Kaiser Family Foundation found just 51 percent now support   Medicare-for-all, a two-point drop from last month and a five-point drop   since April, even as the share of those who oppose it is growing.    Questions about how Democrats plan to pay for these things are only going to   intensify as we approach the general election, and as more Americans   realize that they\u2019ll certainly have to pay higher taxes for socialized   health care and college, such policies will likely continue to lose   support.    Much has been made so far in the Democratic primary   about \u201celectability\u201d versus \u201cprogressive bona fides,\u201d with former vice   president Joe Biden filling the role of the most electable Democrat in a   one-on-one contest with Trump. Warren and Sanders, whose plans on   everything from health care to the Green New Deal involve a massive   expansion of government spending and authority over a sprawling array of   activities, excite the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive base.    Now that Warren is the clear frontrunner, the problem facing the party is   impossible to deny: the candidate who can win the primary by being   furthest to the left is going to have serious problems in the general.    The mainstream media aren\u2019t doing Warren or Democrats any favors by   continuing to treat her with kid gloves. The Washington Post\u2019s Margaret   Sullivan suggested that journalists\u2019 questions about funding   Medicare-for-all shouldn\u2019t make Warren look bad or enable Republicans to   exploit the issue. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s legitimate to dig into the costs,   but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the   larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the   bait.)\u201d    This sentiment was echoed by Jay Rosen, who claimed that   trying to pin Warren down on whether her policies would raise taxes on   the middle class should be a \u201ccredibility killer\u201d\u2014for the press!    On the contrary, the idea that questions about the cost of major policy   proposals might be exploited in the general election is a good reason to   hash them out in a primary debate. It\u2019s sort of the point of primary   season. And it\u2019s not \u201ctaking the bait\u201d for Warren to give an honest and   straightforward answer about how to pay for her signature policy ideas.    The longer Warren remains the frontrunner, the more these questions will   come up. Her inability or unwillingness to give honest answers should   concern Democrats who need to persuade non-leftist Americans to support   their nominee. As things now stand, Warren herself created a few nice   GOP campaign ads Tuesday night.\" ", "Nomore Illegals please": "Warren throws a fit every time she talks ", "John Harris": "None of you are beating Trump ", "Scott's Tots": "\"I\u2019m all for a woman President when a competent one is presented.

Elizabeth would probably just slightly level the current 75 degree tilt the playing field now is at,  in favor of Corporations to be slightly more in favor of women and minorities by a few degrees. But Corporate America has skewed the Government so much in their favor, that what we are talking about here in a future Warren Presidency, is just a little less UNFAIRNESS, not like things will ever, ever be fair and beneficial for the soon to lost middle class.    Reality: She would be fighting an uphill battle in the White House every GD day of her office. It would be a sheer act of GOD if 30% of her proposals in some muted form were to actually pass the Congress and Senate and be enacted into law.

At best she could get some High Net Worth Income tax passed that all your accountants and lawyers would just have to get creative and find a work around.

A single male in good health nonsmoker would still expect about $13K in outlaw between monthly premium and deductible just to be in a crappy Bronze plan. So really, either Insurers will be penalized for this or they will have to adjust their premiums. Because the consumer by and large is paying a huge part of health care.     And don't get me started on Corporate America and minimum wages. After decades of huge profits where they moved whole factories to China to take advantage of the $2 a day labor, now they either have to take it up their A@@ by the Chinese in terms of Technology Transfer or Shared Ownership with PRC government entities, OR, they have to move the plants somewhere else or even, WOW, move a plant back home. No they don't want to pay American workers $6 per hour let alone $15 per hour.     So they would rather move the supply chain to Viet Nam than back home! And American workers are the Unpatriotic ones? Our workers want to work. But no jobs because Asia has all our manufacturing, because Corporate Boards of Directors back in the 1970\"\"s after Nixon made a Deal with Mao, said you just stay cool to Russia, and we will bring you Textile Plants and Chemical Plants, and small appliance plants.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

", "tailorxtaylor": "\"You will never see a Democrat more angry than when a person of color sides with a Republican. Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance  inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked\u00a0so viscously and mercilessly each time  like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party?\u00a0      Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power.\u00a0      It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts,\u00a0they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.\u00a0 If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch?\u00a0      The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right?\u00a0  If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate.\u00a0      Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.\u00a0\u00a0      By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.\u00a0 Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?\" ", "Stev En": "\"Warren needs to learn how to formulate better comebacks on the debates.

And you know, I almost NEVER see any reference to it. I call it the TRIPLE whammy. Because you had double digit everything with the digits being on the nasty side.   Here is my recollection. There was high interest rates for home loans. 18% or higher at times. INFLATION  was double digit. I mentioned I was layed off. Well, when I would go to look for a job.... one day I applied or thought I would apply, for a $5 an hour job as a termite technician, a fairly thankless job, and there was a line a people stretched halfway around the block!!

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.

Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance  inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked\u00a0so viscously and mercilessly each time  like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party?\u00a0      Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power.\u00a0      It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts,\u00a0they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.\u00a0 If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch?\u00a0      The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right?\u00a0  If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate.\u00a0      Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.\u00a0\u00a0      By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.\u00a0 Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?\" ", "Ahmad Alsmadi": "\"Twist your words however you want #wallstreetpete  we will not choose a candidate that is bought by billionaires.\" ", "Tony Tate": "\"Gay President yes   Gay Vice President yes   Pete Buttigieg NO!

Warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of Medicare for all.        Unlike Warren, Bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the General election. Warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the Primary, so Bernie won't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected.        Warren originally planned on voting for Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing, but then flip flopped when she was criticized.        Warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'Medical Device Tax' which would have helped defund the ACA, in order to appease the Medical Device Industry in her state.        Unlike Warren, Bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s. Warren was a staunch Republican up until the late 90s.        Bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress, he was a mayor in Vermont, and has a lot of experience in governance compared to Warren.        Warren voted twice to increase the Military budget brought forth under Pres. Trump, which appropriated over $81Billion for purchase of Aircraft, Weapons, Missiles, and Combat Vehicles. On top of that it appropriated several Billion dollars toward other parts of the DoD.        Bernie wants to cancel all student debt, Warren wants to implement a means-tested solution. A Means-tested program will likely further split people into the \"\"haves\"\" vs. \"\"have-nots\"\" and are easier to attack, dismantle, and weaken. Take a means-tested program like Welfare vs a universal program like Social Security as an example. Welfare is very unpopular whereas Social Security is very popular.
