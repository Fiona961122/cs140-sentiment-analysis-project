- Context-dependent slogans like "MATH - Make America Think Harder" should generally be left unannotated?
    - Except for MATH; can be regarded as general positive sentiment
- Implicit references to policy e.g. "he will do so much good to the economy" as an implicit reference to UBI?
- Should policy be lumped under single category since there are so many and emphases are different between cands?
    - if not, what is a general policy comment to be filed under?

- Could the following be "general"?
    - What about "show us your sources" type comments? / "your argument is invalid" type comments?
    - What about something the candidate did previously e.g. Venture for America for Yang
        - e.g. "Venture for America steered young graduates away from some of the most secure careers and into the risky business of business startups."
- Are we doing 3 or 5 labels?
- Need examples of
    - policy vs political ideology
    - trash comments that can be discarded
    - voter appeal vs general likeability
    - neutral category
        - is doubt neutral?
