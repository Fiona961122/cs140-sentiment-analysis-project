further more that you are stealing from people almost everyone in fact . first you use examples that upset me .   1 : milton friedman   i like milton friedman but you name drop him rather than listen to him . milton passed away so he ca n't defend himself , but i 'm sure he would call you out for the con man you are if he were still alive today . milton 's ubi was for a small % of the population , it was a way of getting rid of an amount of inefficient welfare , but he would prefer no welfare . the ubi was a way to reduce welfare spending and clear up bureaucracy . the host in the interview most are now familiar with tells milton that abuse would be rampant and it 's no better than welfare ... milton agrees . the point milton makes is that no one will stand to lose their welfare , so he offered a slightly better way to do it .   2 : alaska permanent fund   it 's a bit shocking you talk about being good with math and push a ubi when the examples you give to support this scam have so many holes in it , and i believe you are aware of this fact as you are a con man . your ubi is for 1k a month , alaska is for far less than 2k a year . furthermore not everyone in alaska gets the subsidy , they have to qualify for it . alaska is also not the whole country , goods can be bought outside of alaska to avoid a vat tax but in this case the tax is only on oil , not all business , meaning there is no vat tax weighing down new business or even established business ... thus inflation is avoided . the fund also changes based on profits , if you did that you would n't know how much the payments would be month to month . these are monolithic differences . you also sight 2k a year in alaska but it only happened 2x in 37 years , waaay back in 2017 people received a whole $ 1,100 for the year . so you would expect at least a 11th the possible inflation compared to your numbers .   3 : inflation   inflation will occur because as i mentioned above you will lock the whole nation into a vat tax , this tax will in fact drive up costs , many business might even fail due to the tax even if they push up prices . rent will probably be the first thing to jump up in costs . housing prices next as people run out to spend their bribes causing home sales to surge , and thus expand in costs . i assume inflation will start immediately but how long until the 1k bribe becomes worthless i ca n't say .   unlike in alaska all new business will have to factor in a 10 % profit loss that is their income , so if you own a business ( small business more than large ) you are paying for your 1k a month thought the vat tax meaning if you own a small business you do n't get any of your bribe . you will never tax enough as you are fully aware of and you will in fact be printing money . this time inflation will be felt because when obama gave money to the rich banks they sat on it ... they knew the risk of lending well outweighed safer internal investments . banks got money for well under 1 % from the federal reserve , they hardly needed to do much to be profitable , so they sat on the money . the bribe will be spend in the economy thus inflating the actual money supply .   4 : social security   this is where you dive right into theft . ss is not a welfare program so much as it 's a forced savings account , the government acts as a bank and pays the money back because many humans do n't save or spend money wisely ... like they will do with the ubi money . if a person ( over 200 million persons btw ) paid into ss but the dividend bribe `` '' replaces '' '' ss then you need to stop taxing us for ss because we will never collect it . you also need to pay us back asap , all of the money anyone ( rich or poor ) paid into ss with interest . if you keep taxing every single person for ss then you are adding a vat on top of a ss tax and in fact you will have made ss a tax rather than a program for retirement . simply put , your double dipping for revenues , vat and ss tax .   i understand you give people an option to pick the dividend bribe over ss , but again all you 're doing is steeling what someone had removed from their paycheck for a lifetime to help pay for your bribe . if you stop deducting ss for everyone 's paycheck you lose the funds to help pay your immoral scam to people .   5 : jobs   i find it fantastical that you tell people automation is coming and that this means jobs are leaving and will never come back . this is where you pitch the dividend bribe as a way to help people live as they look for more work or start a new business . there are so many conflicting points in there that it 's hard to describe .   if people can find other work or start their own business ( creating their own work ) then you lied , jobs are not gone for good ... jobs simply changed . in that case the ubi is not needed and you would have to admit your error . however you have made it clear we will have more people than jobs due to automation , this is the crutch of your argument , using fear to sell your scam . in this case things spiral out of control ... if people ca n't find work this means the dividend bribe is all they have to live off , but with inflation this hurts people on ss or depend on the dividend bribe to live the most . rent will increase , the costs for goods will increase because unlike alaska all business are paying the vat tax and raising costs of good as taxes are factored into every single sale under `` '' cost of doing business '' '' .   6 : savings   if inflation is an issue , and it should be a huge problem under the ubi , then savings loses value . anyone with money in the bank is made more poor as their dollars buying power shrinks considerably . would you tell a business to not raise the necessary funds to save and pay for a tax ? is that really the kind of advice you give people ?   7 : bribes   the ubi is a bribe and i do feel you should be in jail for doing it . bribing people to vote for you is illegal and you are doing this on a grand scale . what if someone in the democrat party , or even republican party ran against you claiming $ 1,500 for a dividend bribe is more in line with people 's needs ? $ 1,000 appears arbitrary , made up and based on absolutely nothing outside what sounds good but not toooooo gooood .   how did you settle on 1k bribes ? why is this number so round ... will it go up over time , what metric is used to qualify adjustments up or down ? the alaska fund goes up and down , does your bribe ? in fact in alaska you always claim 2k a year but many years were under 1k , in fact only two years were ever above 2k . a looong time ago in 2017 the pay out was only $ 1,100 , so the adjustments can be huge . 2012 and 2013 were under 1k , around $ 900 for those years . will you adjust your bribes where a range is 500-1000 $ a month ?   8 : greed   this ubi is based on greed , you can see it in just about every one of the supporters you have that talk about it . there are even support videos asking people how they would spend their bribes , and it sure does feel good to watch ... if you are greedy . up front people are like , `` '' i 'm gon na pay bills , open a business , '' '' yet they never did these things in the first place , so why would they now ? and how does 1k a month make a business possible ?   you are an evil human and like to use dead people to support you bad ideas who ca n't defend themselves , like milton friedman . now mf and thomas sowell talk a lot about mal-investment . when money is cheap people spend it frivolously , this means bad investments are made and at some point the economy contracts due to failing businesses and other bad investments . a recession occurs and prices dive as people rush to sell their assets for prices that reflect reality before they lose more value , often they end up selling assets for a loss . the correction happens and the economy heals .   watching so many heartwarming stories of people ready to rush out and open a business because now they have so much free money to work with seems like the world 's largest recipe for economic disaster . investments will be poorly made because `` '' wtf does it matter if i fail , lolz ? '' '' the business fails and the person walks away , they probably do n't even care if their assets rots because your bribe pays some their personal bills . in that case items will cost more because so many people will sit on stuff being too lazy to sell , eating up resources and watching them waste away .  you lie openly and it 's upsetting to see people taken advantage of so easily .  i 'll leave with this quote from a man much smarter than yang will ever be . this man was so smart he predicted yang almost 250 years ago . read it and let it sink in , do n't react like a child , take it in . `` when the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic .

'' o put another way , these assets wear out faster or have a shorter life span than traditional investments , meaning more capital is used up in the production process . the result is less net income to go around for both labor and business . o what 's also generated more income for capital at the expense of labor is the rise of `` superstar '' firms and greater substitution of technology for people . o applewould be a textbook example of a superstar firm . alphabet'sgoogle and microsoftwould be others . these companies generate huge profits by developing stranglehoods on certain markets due to innovation , strong patent protection or a lack of competition . o what 's more , the groundbreaking technologies these companies produce have made it cheaper and more efficient for companies to deploy robots and automation instead of workers . o `` if labor plays less of a role in production , for example through lower employment , its share of income can decline , '' mckinsey noted . https : //www.marketwatch.com/story/weaker-unions-globalization-not-to-blame-for-shrinking-slice-of-income-pie-for-workers-2019-05-29 ? mod=mw_theo_homepage a new look at the declining labor share of income in the united states . https : //www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/a-new-look-at-the-declining-labor-share-of-income-in-the-united-states  read the commentaries , '' '' tech_effects_1 to 24 '' '' , under the `` '' threat of automation .

the changes made to the talking points in order to suggest the attack was motivated by an anti-muslim video ; and the refusal of the white house to say what presidentobamadid the night of the attack.3 . keeping an eye onthe associated press : the justice department performed a massive cull of associated press reporters ' phone records as part of a leak investigation . 4 . rosengate : the justice department suggested thatfox newsreporter james rosen is a criminal for reporting about classified information and subsequently monitored his phones and emails.5 . potential holder perjury i : attorney general eric holder told congress he had never been associated with `` potential prosecution '' of a journalist for perjury when in fact he signed the affidavit that termed rosen a potential criminal.6 . the atf `` fast and furious '' scheme : federal agencies allowed weapons from u.s. gun dealers to `` walk '' across the border into the hands of mexican drug dealers . the atf summarily lost track of scores of those weapons many of which were used in crimes including the december 2010 killing of border patrol agent brian terry.7 . potential holder perjury ii : holder told congress in may 2011 that he had just recently heard about the fast and furious gun walking scheme when there is evidence he may have known much earlier.8 . sebelius demands payment : hhs secretary kathleen sebelius solicited donations from companies hhs might regulate . the money would be used to help her sign up uninsured americans for obamacare.9 . the pigford scandal : an agriculture department effort that started as an attempt to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency but evolved into a gravy train delivering several billion dollars in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who probably did n't face discrimination.10 . gsa gone wild : thegeneral services administrationin 2010 held an $ 823 000 training conference in las vegas featuring a clown and a mind readers . resulted in the resignation of the gsa administrator.11 . veterans affairs in disney world : the agency wasted more than $ 6 million on two conferences in orlando . an assistant secretary was fired.12 . sebelius violates the hatch act : a u.s. special counsel determined that sebelius violated the hatch act when she made `` extemporaneous partisan remarks '' during a speech in her official capacity last year . during the remarks sebelius called for the election of the democratic candidate for governor of north carolina.13 . solyndra : republicans charged the obama administration funded and promoted its poster boy for green energy despite warning signs the company was headed for bankruptcy . the administration also allegedly pressed solyndra to delay layoff announcements until after the 2010 midterm elections.14 . aka lisa jackson : former epa administrator lisa jackson used the name `` richard windsor '' when corresponding by email with other government officials drawing charges she was trying to evade scrutiny.15 . the new black panthers : the justice department was accused of using a racial double standard in failing to pursue a voter intimidation case against black panthers who appeared to be menacing voters at a polling place in 2008 in philadelphia.16 . waging war all by myself : obama may have violated the constitution and both the letter and the spirit of the war powers resolution by attacking libya without congressional approval.17 . biden bullies the press : vice president biden 's office has repeatedly interfered with coverage including forcing a reporter to wait in a closet making a reporter delete photos and editing pool reports.18 . akpd not a-ok : the administration paid millions to the former firm of then-white house adviser david axelrod akpd message and media to promote passage of obamacare . some questioned whether the firm was hired to help pay axelrod $ 2 million akpd owed him.19 . sestak we 'll take care of you : former white house chief of staff rahm emanuel used bill clinton as an intermediary to probe whether former rep. joe sestak ( d-pa. ) would accept a prominent unpaid white house advisory position in exchange for dropping out of the 2010 primary against former sen. arlen specter ( d-pa. ) .20 . i 'll pass my own laws : obama has repeatedly been accused of making end runs around congress by deciding which laws to enforce including the decision not to deport illegal immigrants who may have been allowed to stay in the united states had congress passed the `` dream act .

! ! customers are ! ! no business or corporation can exist without customers or clients . you may have the greatest products or services and it still will not make a difference without customers . guess what if people can not afford your goods or services ? you are guaranteed to go out of business ! henry ford understood this over a hundred years ago . if he paid his employees a high enough wage then in turn they will have means to purchase one of the cars they are producing . this ensured the survival of his business . ford saw this as an investment which he would recover a large portion of that wage back to him .  okay everyone it 's time took look at ubi for what it really represents : leverage ! everything revolves around the concept of leverage . leverage is the super power that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry more with less . the ubi ( freedom dividend ) really represents leverage . the $ 1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage their situation . once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum . as we know leverage is the key ingredient that reduces the energy needed to overcome resistance . this effect minimizes the probability of placing the burden on others . some people like chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery , essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage . their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain . as everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times . this leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level . so the larger the gap the more extreme the leverage becomes . the greatest leverage is held by those of hoarded generational wealth .  those whom are the descendants and beneficiaries of inherited wealth are the primary group which has stigmatized welfare and ubi for generations . they purposely stigmatize and cast shame on those in poverty . and what is truly disgusting is they draw pleasure from cruelly denying any form of assistance and actively work to humiliate one in order to strip them of their human dignity . this is due to the psychological sub-conscious projection of their own guilt for receiving funds by birthright instead of through merit !  other than those entitled pricks there is no good reason to oppose ubi if you are a company or businessman . they are the ones who stand to benefit the most from ubi because it increases the means for patrons to purchase what they are peddling . it is a true investment in the economy rather than giving wealthy pricks tax breaks and subsidies which ultimately causes damage to the economy by extracting the currency from circulating . it becomes hoarded and extracted , placed in an account offshore in a tax shelter . this extracted currency can not generate anything but more leverage sitting in a bank account . it is taken out circulation and can not generate taxes and sales needed for a strong economy . it is beyond short sighted to oppose ubi and favor those whom already posess extreme levels of leverage .  a greater wealth gap will only cause desperation and anxiety which will build even greater economic instability setting the conditions for criminal behavior . a ticking time bomb which will have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of civil unrest . greed and selfishness will blind them from the obvious . the obvious move is you will receive a greater amount of wealth if it is spread out and not concentrated . otherwise , if concentrated you would be choking and killing the golden goose preventing it from continuing to lay it 's golden eggs . it would be much wiser to feed and look out for the gooses best interest , you will be rewarded with a flow of golden eggs  can anyone deny that $ 1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling . to teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind . in fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching . and for the growing homeless population across this country , what could $ 1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job . raising the minimum wage will not even come close to the impact of a $ 1000 a month will do . if fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee . this helps both business owner and consumer by providing more money in hand to support that business with patronage .  the biggest criticism to ubi is the cost . again this is short sighted blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board . starting with the release of pressure and anxiety that scarcity brings . it allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of abundance instead of scarcity . with a scarcity mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials . not to mention the burden that stress related illnesses caused by a scarcity mindset places on the healthcare industry driving up higher healthcare costs . a scarcity mindset effects businesses with less patronage and taxes generated to pay for programs such as ubi . a population that is less financially desperate creates less need to commit crimes , which in turn creates a lesser burden on law enforcement and incarceration . when one is incarcerated it cost real money to feed and house them , this will only become a lesser burden on the tax payer to sustain the institution . this is an inevitable fact when economic despair becomes magnified it starts a domino effect that crimes becomes a reality . desperation creates the mindset of : `` '' if i have nothing than i have nothing to lose '' '' . the cost and burden to society would be multiple times that of the alternative of ensuring a living wage .  just ponder the following thoughts and facts . what impact could the millions of dollars raised and used to run for president do if it were applied to healthcare , ubi or even applied to essentail services ? it is obscene to see it wasted in the pursuit of public office .  let 's get some perspective of how obscene extreme hoarded wealth really is : suppose you had $ 1-billion . you could spend $ 5,000 a day for more than 500 years before you would run out of money .  breaking it down even farther , it means you would have to spend over $ 100,000 every day for the next 25 years in order to spend $ 1-billion .

2019-12-30T05:44:54.000Z `` hm is this what i think it is . a type of new society where people works replace by machines and money get separated from how it supposed to be . i have been thinking about this for a long time for why we are still living in a dark age where people keep abuse money from other people works . there is no way to close the gap between the rich and the poor as well as human are n't the labor to one to another . you basically ask to work but not understanding how to work while there is no money for you to invest especially technology business and education . the problem that this ubi must be separated in money using for human physical needs intellectual activities and survival . dealing with insurance is an alternative route since this only for large investment or safety protection ( basically this is a business model not community access ) . you do n't do that because you know how greedy we are as a person even the banking system themselves . money should be divided into 2 groups : cash and credits . cash only for paying physical materials and credits for services in needs including entertainment education daily basic supplies such as foods water shelter ( rental ) and other survival conditional supports . as for those who want to take advantage of this system to make their own money into the pocket . it is n't going to be easy if the money is just a visual digital value ( like bitcoin as a new type of currency ) . the credit system is based on how much contribution for that person into society economy . in order for people to get the money , they have to prove that they are working and continue to contribute to the society with a record of success and failure by agreement trademark ( signature approval ) . this is where we need a contract , recommendation , or review from a certified resources ( those with qualified credits and have permit license via social security ) . credits build up by works ( things that help others or improve life quality ) , and the more contribution add to the basic income , the more money you will get back each month on saving account . there only two types of payment system needed : a net income account and saving account . net income is the basic money for daily spend and receive throughout individual works that directly get from salary payments and transfer money . saving account only receive the ubi and manual deposit money for fitness plans ( only welfare or benefits is allowed to deposit for no tax or fees ) . the differences that saving money will not get charge by tax while net income does .  another type of money that needed to have but this is restricted to a group project or community use . the commercial business budget ( cbb ) is only using for companies and a group of people who want to invest in scaled projects that individual ca n't do alone with their own money . this is where market holders , tax , stocks , and credits get shared by everyone who sign up for them . base on how much net worth the company get and the percent that a person invest into this project . depend on the agreement , each person get to retrieve a certain amount out to their account for business and other uses ( taxing probably higher than personal use so the only way is taking out the money and transfer to personal account if someone really want to use outside of the business use ) . because this is public to anyone so if someone overuse the money , others will get notice right away ( to avoid moral aspects , cooperations need to secure the money with a safety system beside pin or ssn to the funds ) . the rest work like usual business model .  tax should be different between personal use and business use . the saving account is free tax and no money transfer in except ubi and other free tax income . instead of creating a bunch of welfare that people do n't even use , let choose whatever they want to be with their own money and take responsibility for their actions . if someone afraid about something we ca n't pay back in time . there are insurances and extra services for borrowing or lending money . paying fees for banking and extra charge for resources can be removed from how things just did with the financial crisis . bank should focus on dealing with commercial properties not personal properties . it 's same for educational institutions and non profit groups . for the question where the money come from , look at the stock market over cryptographic blockchains for how to get the money . supply and demand , trading throughout global market economy . the plot hole would begin back to where people think that we owned a land and all materials around us as our properties . you do n't physically create them , we steal them and make money ( rather saying `` borrowing without a refund '' is a more correct term ) . so , it does n't matter how worthy something is but further the needs for providing an access to productive activities are more on concerns .  technically , technology change how things work and it is more about conveniences than stuff like healthcare , insurance , and put high taxes on everything that neither rich or poor get the money they deserve to have while working the heck of what they are doing in general without the society noticed , especially community services , or non profits organizations .

''", "Towing and Roadside LLC": "comment time: 2019-08-23T00:11:20.000Z `` what americans should like about andrew yang 's plans for ubi . the first is the homeless epidemic in our country . with andrew 's ubi every homeless person over eighteen would be given the ability to rent a place to live resulting in homelessness being over for those adults who use it productively solving a problem this country has struggled with for decades . this would save millions in resources allowing current available resources to be focused on homeless youth . this along with the number of kids that are over eighteen still living with parents that can finally afford to move out would also result in empty properties in every city being renovated remodeled and rented as well as new home construction creating thousands of jobs in the real estate construction and home supply industries . as well his plan would dramatically decrease the current number of evictions for renters across america . the ubi can also be used in multiple ways as a crime deterrent . for example if the plan makes it law that anyone convicted of a felony after this becomes policy will be disqualified from receiving the ubi . or any person convicted of a crime in the entire country pay an additional tax that would be directly credited to the ubi program . as well ubi would provide a desperately needed decrease in the constant stress on our law enforcement court and prison systems . most people would think twice before robbing a store or another person for few hundred dollars if it is going to cost them 12 000.00 dollars a year and 120 000.00 over the next ten years . used productively ubi can not only gives people a reason not to commit a crime but as well it can eliminate many of the desperate situations that fuel the desire to commit these crimes in the first place . another huge problem we have struggled with for decades that this plan would have a huge reduction in is domestic violence . the ubi would enable thousands of women to get out of abusive relationships that they are currently in because they do not have the resources to leave . it is a fact that a large percentage of incidents involving everything from verbal abuse physical abuse & divorce begin with financial stress . ubi will almost instantly resolve many of these issues for thousands of households resulting in a dramatic decrease in domestic violence almost overnight saving law enforcement agencies across the country thousands of man hours every night and day . another huge problem our country has had for decades that ubi would almost eliminate overnight is child hunger . no parent or guardian would have an excuse for not providing food to their children receiving the ubi . the next thing ubi would help is single mothers / fathers and daycare / childcare . ubi would allow thousands of single parents to pay for childcare that will allow them to find a job provide for their families . this would also result in a huge increase in jobs in the daycare / childcare industry . another thing i want to mention is the auto industry . ubi would enable thousands or millions to acquire transportation needed to find a job . this will explode the number of jobs in the auto manufacturing financing sales repair transport and insurance industries . every job created by andrew 's plan will be another taxpayer paying taxes . with that said i ask anyone looking at the candidates running for president to acknowledge these few facts all humans should be smart enough to know . no living thing on this earth from a blade of grass to the president had any choice nor can they change what color they were born where they were born who created them when they were born and in a human 's case what they were taught when they were young . to hate a person only for the color of their skin is hating someone for something they had nothing to do with no control of and can not change . no living thing filled out an application for birth . with each and every candidate running for president please listen to their words and plans but ignore their skin color .

'' while that does seem true , taking one part of a sentence out of context to make a point about its entirety is negligent at best . looking at the second amendment as a whole and adding some direction for comprehension it means ; `` '' the right of the people to keep and bear arms '' '' is for the purpose of providing for the `` '' security of a free state '' '' through `` '' a well-regulated militia '' '' who is made up of `` '' the people '' '' to perform the function of providing the security of a free state , `` the right '' to do so , `` '' shall not be infringed . '' '' yep , you can have your armed militia to maintain your state 's security . who is the militia ? 10 usc chapter 12 defines the militia quite plainly . a ) the militia of the united states consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and , except as provided in section 313 of title 32 , under 45 years of age who are , or who have made a declaration of intention to become , citizens of the united states and of female citizens of the united states who are members of the national guard . b ) the classes of the militia are ( 1 ) the organized militia , which consists of the national guard and the naval militia ; and ( 2 ) the unorganized militia , which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the national guard or the naval militia . this is the point where people need to exercise caution . the second amendment does n't provide the right to bear arms to all the people , only those who meet certain criteria as defined by the us codes . there are limitations based on age , sex , national affiliation , as well as active military service history . i am not saying the amendment is wrong . i am saying you have to consider the rest of the governing laws that apply . 10 usc chapter 12 defines what a legal militia is , whereas the constitution does not . and therein lies the problem . for example , 10 usc chapter 12 prevents males over the age of 45 , except as provided in section 313 of title 32 , from this right as well as citizen females that are not members of the national guard and non-citizen females . women who are part of the unorganized militia are not afforded the same right to bear arms as those who are part of the national guard . 32 usc code 313 ( a ) to be eligible for original enlistment in the national guard , a person must be at least 17 years of age and under 45 , or under 64 years of age and a former member of the regular army , regular navy , regular air force , or regular marine corps . to be eligible for reenlistment , a person must be under 64 years of age .  there are a number of things within our constitution that are not expressly defined . what is a state ? what is a militia ? who are the people ? while our forefathers kind of assumed a basic understanding of the language of the time , our government has elected to define some select parts with the us codes that can change the overall meaning of the original intention . this is where there is room for debate .  for example , us code could redefine what a state is or the meaning of the word free . it could go from what we currently understand a free state to be into something completely different . the us constitution is what it is . our problem does n't lie with the words as they were written but in the manipulation of the undefined through the application of `` defining codes .

''", "DRSmetal": "comment time: 2019-12-28T16:09:14.000Z yanglinks.com if y'all need more information on yang 's policy positions .", "Yamashita Koike x DSBPMusic131": "comment time: 2019-12-28T14:59:46.000Z `` i do n't know if i 'm exactly correct on everything i 'm saying but i researched a little and this is my opinion .  his policies sound good but you have to be even more weary about anything sounding good . what i came to understand is that if andrew yang becomes the president of america , he will be the leader through the gateway to a social credit system .  andrew wants `` '' human centered capitalism '' '' . it 's basically socialism and socialism does n't work well with money . at first he says something i agree with . humans are important than money , which is absolutely right . but then :  `` `` the unit of a human capitalism economy is each person , not each dollar '' '' `` '' we need to make the markets serve us rather than the other way around '' '' `` `` we need government leaders who are truly laser-focused on the public interest above all else and will lead companies to act accordingly '' ''  the upside to his campaign kind of sounds like he wants to get more people more leverage when it comes to jobs . one of the concerns is paying everyone equally . to pay everyone equally , everyone will need to get less money . that really does n't pan out too well with prices of our necessities increasing every year . especially when regulators will also be more strict when it comes to a corporations excess profit .  what is weird is how he refers to the corporations as if they are horses and regulators having to rein their excesses in . then says `` '' the government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value '' '' . here i 'm guessing the government is the owner of all the ranches . this is good for people who have the same values . however , i do n't think that everyone really does .  `` '' regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position '' '' . that sounds like many corporations can face dramatic changes . excess money can be used to reinvest into corporations immediately . but with this being a socialist method , the market needs to serve the people . as a result , this can just hurt the corporations . regulators would need to be at the top of their game all the time . additionally , they will be blocked out of an opportunity within the private sector . their relationships with private sectors will become stagnant .  so now we have to ask how we affected by these regulators . with timebanking , they would be required to be more critical of how they regulate buisness and determining the value of a time credit . they would have to make it fair while evaluating the skill set and social value of each person . people getting paid accordingly will be very rough . i assume time credits wo n't fully replace curremcy . if this is to become popular people should keep this in mind : will there be free classes to ensure that we all have the skills to acquire time credits ? on one hand , there wo n't be any because that takes time . people need to get paid to instruct , vast resources need to be acquired for the facilities usage and space will either need to be rented or constructed . now let 's say the government creates a loophole ( cause they 're the government ) , goes with this idea and pays out whatever amount of money to get this done . this has potential because job openings will increase through timebanking . however , there is still a drawback here . if they did that , i 'm sure the government would tax us significantly to recoup losses and inevitably create a time credit monopoly . you have to account for a person 's ingenuity , transportation , possible relocation for living quarters , etc . even if people become like minded to make living easier , where would the money come from to support the people if timebanking becomes more prevalent or possibly our stable ?  andrew 's campaign is meant to help out everyone do more than just get by . if people are expected to work multiple positions and are rewarded by meeting social expectations , they will be under pressure . not only that , but what exactly will be acceptable in terms of social value ? if you want to say that humans are more important than money , then you have to keep morale going . if morale is inconsistent , you will definitely have unhappy people . which can cause inefficiency and lead to termination or people quitting their jobs . here is where we see the downside of maximizing well being meeting the demand of it 's controllers .  andrew also believes in the advancement of technology and it 's uses . with ai , we can have a system that allows us to see how reliable a person is before trading hours with them . similar to how the social credit system is in china . but with technology advancing , it can easily put people out of jobs . with a `` '' wearable device that monitors your vital signs '' '' that also starts `` '' recommending occasional behavior changes '' '' , the world probably would n't even need as many doctor 's . which would be unfortunate for those who spent money and put in effort for a medical degree . but this may be untrue and i can possibly be proven wrong .  speaking of doctors , andrew says he wants to reform the state of our health care system . he acknowledge 's the amount of people who do n't have healthcare , the difficulty paying off expenses , the job lock that people face to keep their health care plan and doctors not being able to properly help people . now with more people being expected to trade hours doing work for credit , you will risk more people getting sick . this results in more doctors being needed ; especially if we consider doctors needing to spend more time to give proper care and more people obtaining health a care plan . better tests , technology and medicine means more resources and more money . so whether there be more or less doctors , they will continue to struggle with proper compensation . thus , people will continue to struggle with healthcare and may face debt because of it .  lastly , let 's talk about one of andrew 's strongest points : the guaranteed income.yang quotes many people who support this type of thinking . initially , i did think it was a good idea and many others did as well . he wants to give every american $ 1,000/mo so they can add flexibility to their living situation . things may be good for his first year or so but it 'll be rough after that . the reason i say that is because it sounds like he somewhat believes in the free market policy . to my understanding , the free market policy allows financial freedom to obtain innovation within a country . however , a country has to cut corners in order to fulfill its objectives . this is the same policy donald trump follows during his presidency . with the pressure of more responsibility for the regulators , it will be impossible to advance using that policy without consequences . enabling welfare throughout the country , starting the use of time banking and tax increases mean living will become more expensive . resulting in people becoming dependent on welfare and struggling for time credit throughout his term as president . it will become likely that also america will face an economic crash due to it 's large demand for resources and it 's inability to pay off debt . effectively making it a third world country .  that concludes my take on his policies . i may be wrong about some things but we 'll have to see .

it seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked so viscously and mercilessly each time like clockwork . how does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party ?   whatever the justification , the reason is clear : it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color . by leaving the democratic party , they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics . if you stop thinking about yourself as an african-american , or muslim-american or hispanic-american , and start thinking about yourself as an american , then the left can not control you through fear anymore . they want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that republics are racists , and once you stop believing that , they lose all their power .   it concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person , but as an individual with their own ideas that can not be defined by where they came from or how they look . they have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy , principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race . since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts , they can not be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power . in essence , they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly . and this scares the hell out of democrats , to the point of rage , because when people lose power they become angry . hence why democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race , but yet the democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear . if every black person thinks differently and independently , how will the democrats control the entire bunch ?   the number one agenda of the democratic party is portray all white males , especially those in the republican party as inherent racist . and if you 're not racists then you 're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue . we see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs , even if only subtly alluded to . race underpins the discussions surrounding everything : sports , immigration , law enforcement , foreign policy , education , hollywood and even climate change . it is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change , right ? if democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines , in every aspect of american life , then they can easily control us with one message , through the mechanisms of fear and hate .   here is how they do it : they report on a story and make it always about race . they then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism , because we all know you ca n't shoot the messenger . after they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories , they then say their agenda is to bring us back together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines . rinse and repeat . their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest , leaving us to hang in the balance , while they pull their strings like puppeteers , laughing all the way to the bank .   by making race the number one focus , it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies . they do n't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel . they will not be held accountable for actually improving american lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what 's actually really important : which is policy . endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats , because no matter how bad they themselves behave , well , at least they 're not racist , right ?

! ! customers are ! ! no business or corporation can exist without customers or clients . you may have the greatest products or services and it still will not make a difference without customers . if people can not afford your goods or services ? you are guaranteed to go out of business ! henry ford understood this over a hundred years ago . if he paid his employees a high enough wage then in turn they will have means to purchase one of the cars they are producing . this ensured the survival of his business . ford saw this as an investment which he would recover a large portion of that wage back to him .   okay everyone it 's time took look at ubi for what it really represents : leverage ! everything revolves around the concept of leverage . leverage is the super power that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry more with less . the ubi ( freedom dividend ) really represents leverage . the $ 1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage their situation . once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum . as we know leverage is the key ingredient that reduces the energy needed to overcome resistance . this effect minimizes the probability of placing the burden on others . some people like chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery , essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage . their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain . as everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times . this leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level . so the larger the gap the more extreme the leverage becomes . the greatest leverage is held by those of hoarded generational wealth .  those whom are the descendants and beneficiaries of inherited wealth are the primary group which has stigmatized welfare and ubi for generations . they purposely stigmatize and cast shame on those in poverty . and what is truly disgusting is they draw pleasure from cruelly denying any form of assistance and actively work to humiliate one in order to strip them of their human dignity . this is due to the psychological sub-conscious projection of their own guilt for receiving funds by birthright instead of through merit !  other than those entitled pricks there is no good reason to oppose ubi if you are a company or businessman . they are the ones who stand to benefit the most from ubi because it increases the means for patrons to purchase what they are peddling . it is a true investment in the economy rather than giving wealthy pricks tax breaks and subsidies which ultimately causes damage to the economy by extracting the currency from circulating . it becomes hoarded and extracted , placed in an account offshore in a tax shelter . this extracted currency can not generate anything but more leverage sitting in a bank account . it is taken out circulation and can not generate taxes and sales needed for a strong economy . it is beyond short sighted to oppose ubi and favor those whom already posess extreme levels of leverage .  a greater wealth gap will only cause desperation and anxiety which will build even greater economic instability setting the conditions for criminal behavior . a ticking time bomb which will have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of civil unrest . greed and selfishness will blind them from the obvious . it is obvious to spread the wealth to generate commerce rather than to concentrate it . otherwise , if concentrated you would be choking and killing the golden goose preventing it from continuing to lay it 's golden eggs . it would be much wiser to feed and look out for the gooses best interest , you will be rewarded with a flow of golden eggs  can anyone deny that $ 1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling . to teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind . in fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching . and for the growing homeless population across this country , what could $ 1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job . raising the minimum wage will not even come close to the impact of a $ 1000 a month will do . if fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee . this helps both business owner and consumer by providing more money in hand to support that business with patronage .  the biggest criticism to ubi is the cost . again this is short sighted blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board . starting with the release of pressure and anxiety that scarcity brings . it allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of abundance instead of scarcity . with a scarcity mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials . not to mention the burden that stress related illnesses caused by a scarcity mindset places on the healthcare industry driving up higher healthcare costs . a scarcity mindset effects businesses with less patronage and taxes generated to pay for programs such as ubi . it also will lessen the burden on law enforcement and incarceration . when one is incarcerated it cost real money to feed and house them , this will only become a lesser burden on the tax payer to sustain the institution . this is an inevitable fact when economic despair becomes magnified it starts a domino effect that crimes becomes a reality . desperation creates the mindset of : `` '' if i have nothing than i have nothing to lose '' '' . the cost and burden to society would be multiple times that of the alternative of ensuring a living wage .  ponder this : suppose you had $ 1-billion . you could spend $ 5,000 a day for more than 500 years before you would run out of money . breaking it down even farther , it means you would have to spend over $ 100,000 every day for the next 25 years in order to spend $ 1-billion .

a use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system ( universal basic income ( ubi ) / freed dividend ( fd ) ) to solve a problem . as such , it describes the goals of the users ( or community citizens ) , the interactions between the users ( community citizens ) and a coordinating system ( of leadership ; mayor , etc . ) , and the required ( overall ) behavior within a system ( trickle-up economic strategy ) in satisfying these goals .   use case model for trickle-up community-based capitalism : date : november 9th , 2020 ; democratic nominee andrew yang wins the general election and becomes the 2020 president-elect . date : february 21 , 2021 ; freedom dividend hrxx bill is enacted into law , and because of the ease of implementation ( irs will distribute the $ 1000 freedom dividend starting april 1 , 2021 .   community action strategies across the nation : date : february 22 , 2021 ; mayors , commissioners , and or community leaders of three communities ( appalachian-american , african american , and hispanic- american ) having a population of one thousand adults ( age 18 and up ) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90 % ( 900 ) participation out of a population of 1000 adults .   how a trickle-up community-based free-market strategy might work ? planning scenario : in trickle-up community-based capitalism , there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy , such as through enterprise resource planning ( erp ) . in an erp use-case scenario , participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders ( mayor , commissioner , etc . ) on how to strengthen their dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life .   rewriting the rules of our local economies to work for us : through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $ 900,000 ( monthly ) or $ 10,800,000 ( annually ) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially . thus , re-writing the rules of a trickle-up ' community-based economy that locally , regionally works for them .   economic prognosis : date : april 1 , 2021 , trickle-up appalachian-american , african-american , and hispanic-american economic self-determination ( based on humanitarian capitalism ) is rolled out across the nation .  question : what is your community population ? what might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000 ?  come on think harder !

''", "Yang-It-Yin": "comment time: 2019-10-17T12:18:17.000Z `` andrew yang has a grasp and understanding at what is the underlying forces that are causing the effects . the negative perception of ubi has been conditioned and stigmatized by the wealthy for generations . it is perceived as a handout charity something that should be shameful . the reality is it the most practical solution that kills multi birds with one stone . it should appeal to both the left & right . let me explain my understanding that it not only makes sense but it vitally necessary !  everything revolves around the concept of leverage . leverage is the super power that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry more with less . the ubi ( freedom dividend ) really represents leverage . the $ 1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage the situation . once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum . as we know leverage is the key ingredient that enables the ability to carry multiple times your weight . this enables and minimizes the probability in burdening others in helping to carry that weight . some people like chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery , essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage . their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain . as everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times . their leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level . so the larger the gap the more extreme the leverage becomes . the wealthy which hold the higher ground have little incentive to circulate that wealth back into the system which may compromise their leverage .  can anyone deny that $ 1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling . to teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind . in fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching . and for the growing homeless population across this country , what could $ 1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job . raising the minimum wage will not even come close to the impact of a $ 1000 a month will do . if fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee . this helps both business owner and provides more money in hand to support that business with patronage .  the time has come to break the stigma and myths which we have been conditioned to . especially the trickle down economy myth . the wealthy are not job creators ! ! ! customers are ! ! no business can exist without customers . you may have the greatest products or services and it still will not make a difference without customers . so if people can not afford your goods or service , then guess what ? you will go out of business ! if you are a company or businessman then it would be in your own best interest to support something like ubi . otherwise , to support these wealthy pricks with tax breaks and subsidies is beyond short sighted and will ultimately work against your interests . a greater wealth gap will only cause desperation and anxiety which will build even greater economic instability and lead to crime . a real powder keg which can have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of civil unrest . your greed and selfishness has left you blind to the obvious . the obvious move is you will receive a greater amount of wealth if it is spread out and not concentrated ; instead of choking and killing the golden goose up front . it would be much wiser to feed and look out for the gooses best interest , you will be rewarded with a flow of golden eggs .  the biggest criticism to ubi is the cost . again this is short sighted blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board . starting with the release of pressure and anxiety that scarcity brings . it allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of abundance instead of scarcity . with a scarcity mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials . this effects businesses with less patronage . with less desperation creates less need to commit crimes . with economic despair many commit crimes to purposely be locked up to gain food and shelter . a burden on the tax payer . huge amount of money saved by minimizing the welfare bureaucracy system . and as andrew yang suggest a value added tax of fraction of a percent per purchase would not even be noticed .  and for all you champions of capitalism .  it 's time to receive our our dividends from our other capital ventures we have invested in . like the military arms industry and financial industry . starting the for profit military arms manufacturing industry . this industry is technically a damaging type socialism . a socialism that does not serve society , instead it uses society as a means of capital . it is called subsidized capital . `` `` we the people '' '' subsidize the industry through government contracts . contracts which are financed through the capital provided by taxes . thus if this was truly a capitalist venture then `` '' we the people '' '' are investors and should share in the profits gained from that capital . that capital enable the means of the production . as investors not only did we not receive a dividend when arms are sold to other nations . the us sells weapons and military equipment to many nations around the world . creating huge profits . profits which were enabled by the peoples capital . if we are a true capitalist system then those who provide their capital to risk should receive a dividend for their investment . and it time to receive our dividends for providing the bail out capital to the wall street financial industry .
