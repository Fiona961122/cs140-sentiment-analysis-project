Honestly, I feel like UBI puts too much weight on the value of capitalism. It relies on companies to be ethical, to provide things for affordable prices, to treat consumers with human dignity, but are these all things that companies really do? We need to unconditionally support the right to healthcare, food, and shelter. There's a good chance that just throwing money at poor people won't be able to provide those things, especially if the rich businesses don't care about providing them.

Out of the top 12 causes of death in America......


1. Heart disease

Number of deaths per year: 635,260
Percent of total deaths: 23.1 percent

3. Accidents (unintentional injuries)
ALL ACCIDENTS  including automotive accidents.

Number of deaths per year: 161,374

Shouldn‚Äôt we wait until we actually need to implement this? The prospect of saving 100 billion+ is good but that‚Äôs taking into account the coming decades, so let‚Äôs calm down a little about this and work it out for the future because that money is not saved up yet. Plus of course, the other 1.7 billion dollars. The idea is good but it‚Äôs too early to execute and get satisfying results, if it‚Äôs implemented too soon then people will develop a certain stigma towards that idea and it might not get through when it‚Äôs actually needed.

Ok, imagine these two scenarios:

1) Automation starts replacing factory, trucking, warehouse, and restaurant jobs at an alarming rate, putting millions of people out of work. Who's going to be able to afford to buy anything, in this case? If these companies don't have enough customers to do business, replacing humans with machines won't work, and they'll collectively be forced to reconsider their entire operation, or lower their prices.

2) UBI is in practice, the companies who screwed us over are doing well, they can even raise their prices without worry, plenty of spending money to go around. More and more companies follow this pursuit. Meanwhile, as confidence grows that this new system is working, more and more people are losing their jobs, by the millions. But then, a new reality starts to sink in; people without jobs can't AFFORD to live on a thousand dollars a month, if that's all they have. So now what happens? Now companies start to lose business, again. That money for a vast majority of people is going for basic survival. The new system will not hold, and an economic crash is inevitable. 

Why don't they try giving a thousand dollars a month to the homeless in San Francisco, the ones who are pooping in the streets because they don't have a toilet to use. See what happens. Do you think someone living on the street is going to use that money to buy a new car or computer? Do you think they could even buy a TOILET with it?? Of course not, because they have no home to put it in. It'll go for food, alcohol and drugs. This is what will happen. Every American town will turn into San Francisco, with poop-lined streets and homeless people everywhere.

Prices increase to essentially soak up inflation. Let‚Äôs do some basic arithmetic.

We assuming $1000 per month.

$1000 * 12 = $12000 per citizen

Let us assume out of 325.7 million of the American population 300 million are eligible for this benefit.

$12000 * 300,000,000 = $3.6 Trillion per annum. Approximately.

After ten years of the policy; and not accounting for a massive spike of inflation because MORE CURRENCY IN THE SYSTEM CREATES INFLATION, and a devaluation in purchasing power, AND INFLATION IS COMBATED, by businesses, BY HIGHER PRICES. Please, are you in agreement with this? This is a well understood economic principle.

$3.6 Trillion * 10 = $36 Trillion

How can you disagree that this would cripple the US economically? This isn‚Äôt even accounting for the rise of inflation due to an increase of the money supply by government borrowing.

I agree with the other person, it will happen. This is an emulation of the last stage of the Roman Empire, where 20% of all inhabitants of Rome depended on state handouts. Now, you are all arguing that upwards of 90% of the citizenry of he entire country should be dependent on state handouts.

$1000 per month, and with the median US salary is $3,714, the UBI would be approximately 26.9% (30%) of ones per monthly income. This will stifle employment rates; believe me, you might think that everyone is like us and would wish to take that $1000 and work just the same hours and add it to a larger amount of income at the end of the month, but some people live week to week and like that lifestyle; so, therefore, I can imagine a system where they work either part time or become self-employed for a construction sub-contractor, and work half their usual hours and enjoy their newly acquired free time. This could go really bad; and obviously this has negative impacts on economic growth.

If economic growth is stifled then paying back the newly created currency - called servicing the debt - is very much impossible. If we do not maintain around a 3% per annum economic growth within the economy then the monetary and economic system will be put under tremendous strain.

Incentivising the creation of jobs and employment is something that helps the nation, as well as the individual citizen. Giving people ‚Äòfree stuff‚Äô, while massively increasing taxes and civil animosity, is not something that has historically ended well; case in point, the Roman Empire.

However, it is a great way to get the asinine plebeians to vote for you; they do not see the forest for the tree, it would seem.

This would devalue the currency and increase the national debt to dangerously and irreversible levels. If everyone who was eligible was receiving $1000 a month then in 5 years I estimate that it would cost $18 Trillion dollars; by my calculations. 

Furthermore, taking the depreciation in purchasing power of the dollar (obviously, currency is valued by its scarcity and difficulty in acquiring it) into account, $1000 a month within a year would be worth around ¬£450 Net Present Value; you are going to cause a hyper-inflationary collapse of the economy if you manage to enact this UBI proposal. God help us all.

The point is all about the future. Its only a matter of time before the machine replaces all workers. The machine works faster, is more efficient, works non stop day and night, never takes breaks, rarely breaks down, never grumbles about raises or time off. And given it can do more work more efficiently, and do it more cheaply then people, that means it makes the company who uses them, more profit. After all that's what business is all about, making profit is it not? So this man is just informing people that in time, a very short time in the big span of it all. All jobs will go to the machine, as the machine will make the rich man richer. And thats what business is all about, getting richer. Surely you never thought the rich man, the boss, cares about you more over the profits of the business? So who will the rich man choose you or the machine who can make more profit? You know the answer its plain as day is it not. Its what money is all about its what everyone wants which is to save a buck,  and make a profit. And all this the machine can do and they have not even been made to think yet. Its only a short amount of time before the true actual thinking machine is created. One that can not only work more efficiently but can think about new ways to do it even. And that will make the rich man far richer in far less time even. So humanity better be thinking about a back up plan. A way to at least have some money when times are really hard. And the universal income plan can help even if only a little with that, and a little is always better then nothing. The future is coming, its unavoidable and you know what the rich man, the boss, the company or corporation will choose when it comes to choosing you or the machine. No one can be that ignorant not to know, so better to plan ahead for the masses with a plan. And a universal income is a good start in my opinion.

Andrew Yang contridicts himself.

He has said that the reason local businesses are failing is because Amazon is taking over the markets.

The truth is that Americans are choosing to shop on line instead of in their local economy.  It is a matter of convenience and cost savings.

Now he makes the argument that people will spend their $1000.00 a month in their local economy.

That goes against his own reasioning. 

Yang changes the narrative to suite his needs in the moment.

He cares about truck drivers loosing their jobs but ignores the 2.5 million people he will displace with universal Medicare. 

Yang is a con man trying to bribe his way into the whitehouse.
