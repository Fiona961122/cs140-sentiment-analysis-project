I dunno, I like Andrew, but he wants to fund the UBI with a 10% VAT tax, ouch! Any company worth its salt is going to pass that cost on to the consumer. I mean, where else can it come from? I think that a Luxury tax would be better. Al least that tax would be paid for by folks that could afford it, no?

Honestly, I feel like UBI puts too much weight on the value of capitalism. It relies on companies to be ethical, to provide things for affordable prices, to treat consumers with human dignity, but are these all things that companies really do? We need to unconditionally support the right to healthcare, food, and shelter. There's a good chance that just throwing money at poor people won't be able to provide those things, especially if the rich businesses don't care about providing them.

The government owns 90% of student loan debt.  Not private lenders.

As of July 8, 2016, the federal government owned approximately $1 trillion in outstanding consumer debt, per data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That figure was up from less than $150 billion in January 2009, representing a nearly 600% increase over that time span. The main culprit is student loans, which the federal government effectively monopolized in a little-known provision of the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010.

Prior to the Affordable Care Act, a majority of student loans originated with a private lender but were guaranteed by the government, meaning taxpayers foot the bill if student borrowers default. In 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated 55% of loans fell into this category. Between 2011 and 2016, the share of privately originated student loans fell by nearly 90%.

Shouldn‚Äôt we wait until we actually need to implement this?

Plus of course, the other 1.7 billion dollars.

Ok, imagine these two scenarios:

1) Automation starts replacing factory, trucking, warehouse, and restaurant jobs at an alarming rate, putting millions of people out of work. Who's going to be able to afford to buy anything, in this case? If these companies don't have enough customers to do business, replacing humans with machines won't work, and they'll collectively be forced to reconsider their entire operation, or lower their prices.

2) UBI is in practice, the companies who screwed us over are doing well, they can even raise their prices without worry, plenty of spending money to go around. More and more companies follow this pursuit. Meanwhile, as confidence grows that this new system is working, more and more people are losing their jobs, by the millions. But then, a new reality starts to sink in; people without jobs can't AFFORD to live on a thousand dollars a month, if that's all they have. So now what happens? Now companies start to lose business, again. That money for a vast majority of people is going for basic survival. The new system will not hold, and an economic crash is inevitable. 

Why don't they try giving a thousand dollars a month to the homeless in San Francisco, the ones who are pooping in the streets because they don't have a toilet to use. See what happens. Do you think someone living on the street is going to use that money to buy a new car or computer? Do you think they could even buy a TOILET with it?? Of course not, because they have no home to put it in. It'll go for food, alcohol and drugs. This is what will happen. Every American town will turn into San Francisco, with poop-lined streets and homeless people everywhere.

Prices increase to essentially soak up inflation. Let‚Äôs do some basic arithmetic.

We assuming $1000 per month.

$1000 * 12 = $12000 per citizen

Let us assume out of 325.7 million of the American population 300 million are eligible for this benefit.

$12000 * 300,000,000 = $3.6 Trillion per annum. Approximately.

After ten years of the policy; and not accounting for a massive spike of inflation because MORE CURRENCY IN THE SYSTEM CREATES INFLATION, and a devaluation in purchasing power, AND INFLATION IS COMBATED, by businesses, BY HIGHER PRICES. Please, are you in agreement with this? This is a well understood economic principle.

$3.6 Trillion * 10 = $36 Trillion

How can you disagree that this would cripple the US economically? This isn‚Äôt even accounting for the rise of inflation due to an increase of the money supply by government borrowing.

I agree with the other person, it will happen. This is an emulation of the last stage of the Roman Empire, where 20% of all inhabitants of Rome depended on state handouts. Now, you are all arguing that upwards of 90% of the citizenry of he entire country should be dependent on state handouts.

$1000 per month, and with the median US salary is $3,714, the UBI would be approximately 26.9% (30%) of ones per monthly income. This will stifle employment rates; believe me, you might think that everyone is like us and would wish to take that $1000 and work just the same hours and add it to a larger amount of income at the end of the month, but some people live week to week and like that lifestyle; so, therefore, I can imagine a system where they work either part time or become self-employed for a construction sub-contractor, and work half their usual hours and enjoy their newly acquired free time. This could go really bad; and obviously this has negative impacts on economic growth.

If economic growth is stifled then paying back the newly created currency - called servicing the debt - is very much impossible. If we do not maintain around a 3% per annum economic growth within the economy then the monetary and economic system will be put under tremendous strain.

Incentivising the creation of jobs and employment is something that helps the nation, as well as the individual citizen. Giving people ‚Äòfree stuff‚Äô, while massively increasing taxes and civil animosity, is not something that has historically ended well; case in point, the Roman Empire.

However, it is a great way to get the asinine plebeians to vote for you; they do not see the forest for the tree, it would seem.

Sounds like an interesting idea to explore, but 1.) how do you get people to spend that money on Main Street instead of sending it back into The Cloud and 2.) how do you encourage people to use the money for car repairs instead of a bigger TV? Also, 3.) how do you make sure it is the businesses that profit off technology gains at the expense of human jobs that are the ones who pay for this UBI and not penalize businesses that don‚Äôt have anything to do with the problem?

This would devalue the currency and increase the national debt to dangerously and irreversible levels. If everyone who was eligible was receiving $1000 a month then in 5 years I estimate that it would cost $18 Trillion dollars; by my calculations. 

Furthermore, taking the depreciation in purchasing power of the dollar (obviously, currency is valued by its scarcity and difficulty in acquiring it) into account, $1000 a month within a year would be worth around ¬£450 Net Present Value; you are going to cause a hyper-inflationary collapse of the economy if you manage to enact this UBI proposal. God help us all.

This is why The US was envisioned and created as a republic and not an outright democracy of mob rule; the mob is mindless and pathologically greedy.
#####
The point is all about the future. Its only a matter of time before the machine replaces all workers. The machine works faster, is more efficient, works non stop day and night, never takes breaks, rarely breaks down, never grumbles about raises or time off. And given it can do more work more efficiently, and do it more cheaply then people, that means it makes the company who uses them, more profit. After all that's what business is all about, making profit is it not? So this man is just informing people that in time, a very short time in the big span of it all. All jobs will go to the machine, as the machine will make the rich man richer. And thats what business is all about, getting richer. Surely you never thought the rich man, the boss, cares about you more over the profits of the business? So who will the rich man choose you or the machine who can make more profit? You know the answer its plain as day is it not. Its what money is all about its what everyone wants which is to save a buck,  and make a profit. And all this the machine can do and they have not even been made to think yet. Its only a short amount of time before the true actual thinking machine is created. One that can not only work more efficiently but can think about new ways to do it even. And that will make the rich man far richer in far less time even. So humanity better be thinking about a back up plan. A way to at least have some money when times are really hard. And the universal income plan can help even if only a little with that, and a little is always better then nothing. The future is coming, its unavoidable and you know what the rich man, the boss, the company or corporation will choose when it comes to choosing you or the machine. No one can be that ignorant not to know, so better to plan ahead for the masses with a plan. And a universal income is a good start in my opinion.

Now we only have 20 years max to get moving on UBI and 10 years to implement a plan. Or we will have Riots worse than what's going on in France, or worse a revolution part 2.

This century is belong to Asian China and India. Whites are falling behind and never ever get back to the top. China will be top economic superpower and India will be second place in 2030.

Andrew Yang 2020! 
My first year voting and I‚Äôm 24 years old this guy is gonna save the country
#####
I really hope Andrew Yang vets more attention before the 2020 campaign.
#####
Sounds good in fantasy land.
#####
Really wish this would have gone more in depth
#####
You're not gonna get any real useful data. Its like taking a survey with just 1 person. Erhm... useless data.
I bet if you had the WHOLE city on that program, prices of rent, fuel and taxes would go up so after a few years (probably less than 10) it will be like still working poor without any extra money.

00:25

Andrew Yang contridicts himself.

He has said that the reason local businesses are failing is because Amazon is taking over the markets.

The truth is that Americans are choosing to shop on line instead of in their local economy.  It is a matter of convenience and cost savings.

Now he makes the argument that people will spend their $1000.00 a month in their local economy.

That goes against his own reasioning. 

Yang changes the narrative to suite his needs in the moment.

He cares about truck drivers loosing their jobs but ignores the 2.5 million people he will displace with universal Medicare. 

Yang is a con man trying to bribe his way into the whitehouse.
#####
WILL HE be willing to,
1) make a law which gives every voter 400 dollars just for casting a vote? 
(People will show up for the money but eventually they will start paying attention who they vote for. Also, it stimulates the economy. It is a win for democracy and a win for the economy.)

2) Introduce a law for a DIRECT perpetual redistribution of Wealth SUFFICIENT to provide a 'dignified existence' to every citizen regardless of government tax policies or level of technological development of the society?
[ 
I see Capitalism and Governing as if they are athletic events (or a giant game of poker) where anyone who wants to compete for accumulation of Wealth or Power can do so but at the end of the day the winners and the losers can go home and if they still feel the need to compete for more Wealth or Power they can do it the next day .

Basically, not competing in the game of gaining Capital or Power¬† should NOT affect your dignified existence. 
(it means, regardless of you working or not we will provide you with free food, shelter, clothing, free education, free healthcare and free transport for your body.)
]

3) Understand that...
...MOST 'Profit is Theft' if you have employees.
...MOST 'Profit is Theft' if you have more 'leverage' than your customers on the free market.
...'Taxes are Theft' ONLY if they are not spent correctly.

Therefore, the stolen by the businesses and the government¬† must be returned to the humans it is stolen from, meaning, some degree of PERPETUAL REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IS A MUST HAVE.

HOWEVER, for people who dedicate their life to making Profit for themselves, such economic system will make them have a meaningless life. They will resist it.
#####
This has literally been disastrous in every place it's been tried. Horrible idea that only leads to more spending, inflation, and increased prices
#####
You got my vote Andrew.
#####
No, no, no
#####
A troll called Furrowed Brow will be here soon. He will copy paste 3 - 6 times, in separate posts, the same text he's been pasting everywhere. He uses economic arguments but if you look at his interests in race and IQ, he is probably just a white supremacist. He likely is frustrated with his life and needs an ego boost. Pray for FB.
#####
What's gonna happen? You'll give them that thousand, they'll blow it, and still need the 500 for that unexpected bill.
#####
Andrew Yang is very intelligent and smart!
#####
I'd love to see Yang and Bernie on the same ticket.
#####
Even if Andrew doesn't win, I beleive his ideas will.
#####
What is more American than de-incentivizing social welfare poverty class by replacing social welfare with a freedom dividend?! It‚Äôs using capitalism and taxation to grow the economy from the ground up! It eliminates poverty threshold for all
American citizen over the age of 18!!! Currently existing social poverty programs are simply safety net not a solution to eliminate poverty. Declaring  a freedom dividend for every American over the age of 18 is dignified and civilized response that average Americans can easily see the benefit.
#####
Around minute 25 I felt like I was hearing Elon Musk's voice speak
#####
@AndrewYang please be more careful about carbon capturing ideas and mirroring the sun, ecology is a delicate balance. These aren't the best options. Regenerative agriculture and native biodiversity increase carbon sequestering & balance more so than machines and expensive carbon facilities and plants-- and eventually they are free to maintain if  done right. Geoengineering is a messy and complicated topic --glazed over in this talk. Everything else sounds pretty great. Actually want to vote this year.
#####
The two attitudes of life.  One, someone else will take care of this. Or, I will take care of this.

#####
in the mean time we have Trump and his cronies in the WhiteHouse. WTF!!!!
#####
*üíôVote for Yang 2020üíô*
#####
UBI should spread the wealth to all over the country. $1000 is not a big deal in the cities but it is a big deal for 80% country due to the cost of living. More people will move to less cost living areas and spread more business opportunities throughout the country.
#####
This man is way too smart for any other candidates
#####
I donated money for first time ever to any political campaign, I am glad its to Andrew's. He makes so much sense and his solutions and visions are so clear and detailed. Yang 2020!
#####
id buy a new iphone every month how bout dat
#####
You should DEFINITELY tax automation, as long as it doesn't exceed paying a real worker with the total cost of running the automated machines.
#####
I'm 23 and I've never voted or cared about politics whatsoever but this guy is making me optimistic about the future of our country. Getting me to want to vote is an accomplishment in itself lol
#####
This guy just want to sale you his pins for $20.00. SUCKERS
#####
We are so jaded that we don‚Äôt think we deserve better. We do deserve better and this man is the best we have seen in our lifetime!! Don‚Äôt pass this chance to vote in a progressive!
#####
I was just wondering if VP (Mike Pence) is related to the founder (Thomas Pence).?
Thomas Pence must be in pain right now about Mike Pence not doing anything about the UBI idea now.  Because he is the second most influential in the USA now besidesTrump.
#####
I'm not from America but I saw his video on my recommendation. This is the best video I've ever seen on YT. Andrew really made me realised so much about my future and what I should prepare. He speaks facts and statistics and he provides policies that could be a good foundation in improving people's basic living. 

If i have him as a candidate in my country, I'll vote for him üíØ
#####
34:45 is key to why the freedom dividend is so important in that it allows people to make choices about their careers and lives that aren't currently supported by the market
#####
I think his point at around 2:48 can be better summarized as, "in order to do well, you have to do things along a certain line in order to maintain that financial foundation. You can't actually take risks. The idea with the freedom dividend is that the financial foundation is guaranteed in spite of what you choose to do with your life. You are free to take risks and do more fulfilling creative work because of it."
#####
The president explained his policies very clearly well. 

Date 02/24/2021
#####
WOW, üò≥, hearing him speak and tell all of these factual statements and then executable solutions really put a question on my mind, did we Americans lose our logic with time. Plus why can‚Äôt we all just face fact rather than putting on a fake mask.
#####
You know what will happen if everyone has $1k
People think they can afford to move out of their parents' house and raise kids with $1k 
Only if they move out of the city 
Houses in the city would still be expensive if the demand is 100 times greater than the supply
#####
28:09 is so wholesome. 

"And it's even working ^.^"
#####
This man talks sense, clearly understands and offers doable solutions to both old problems and  21st century challenges we all face today. 
     Andrew Yang in the White House: A 21st century president who has a 21st century mindset. Great for the US.. great for the rest of the world.
#####
Dem leaders must put this guy up rather anyone else running with him... He has some common sense and know the realty at least
#####
It's October now, and he's much better with his interviews especially in his answers with the Freedom Dividend and foreign policies.  He's been growing phenomenally  fast with his campaign, and his Yang Gang has done some wonders in spreading his words. (NO thanks to the news media).   No doubt he will be the Democrat nominee.
#####
I think that Andrew Yang is going to be the strongest nominee because he's allowed himself to be question from the left and right unlike Hillary who stole Bernie's chances at nomination.   By letting herself not be challenged it didn't show her weaknesses.
#####
Not right, not left forward...
#####
So, just to make sure I am understanding the Freedom Dividend correctly. The Freedom Dividend is a choice for the American people to apply for, correct? Based on the premise of Yang's response to the first student's question, the American 18 or older citizen can choose to "opt in" to receive up to $1000 in conjunction with his/her current government assistance programs (welfare, social security, etc.) if he/she is not already getting at least $1000 in the first place. For example, if Joe only gets $700 on his Social Security paycheck, then the government would add an extra $300 to Joe's income to satisfy the Freedom Dividend campaign. Or if Mary receives Food Stamps but would prefer the $1000 cash instead, she would have to forgo her Food Stamps benefits to qualify for the $1k cash, is this correct?   It's not a separate check of one grand to everyone regardless of individual economic status. Am I incorrect? Would appreciate anyone's response. Still learning about this, too. Thanks.

I need to talk with you please. i think a lot of folks are missunderstanding what FD really means......


People are not understanding the "Truth of Freedom Dividends".... 

Which is an "OPT IN" program.... seems like alot of people are concerend and calling the FD a Socialist Thought!!!

I hope there are more Clarification about this because i feel this misconception of what the FD really means is getting Lost!!!
#####
Has anyone ever listened to a person like Yang who can synthesize information as eloquently as he does? How does he get all of these good ideas? He studies the data first and then let's his brain stack & compile all of this information recognizing the problem and coming up with all of these whizz bang solutions that we all like. Fricking Amazing! Yang blows my fucking mind. Yang2020 that's all I can say. If Yang wins?¬†
THE WORLD WINS!
#####
0:00: Tell us about UBI. $1k/month for every 18+ yo American, no strings attached, funded by data/tech profits. Idea's been floating around U.S. forever and is in action in Alaska.
1:55: Why does this matter to students? Opens up more options for their careers; less constrained by financial concerns/debt.
3:36: What's been the reaction to your narrative of automation? People, particularly in rural areas, have visceral experience with it, via manufacturing layoffs, so they get it.
5:18: Why doesn't labor move where the jobs are? Economic dynamism, in the form of people moving across state lines, is a multi-decades low, due to financial insecurity.
5:59: How do people living in D.C. or affluent areas react? It's hard for people to relate to some issues; I'm doing the best I can.
7:10: What propelled you to run for president? I could either hope someone else would solve the problems or do it myself; No one in Washington would or could do it.
8:58: How do you stand out from the crowd of candidates? They see I have real solutions and that I argue using facts; people see that's different from other politicians.
9:52: What are some of your thoughts on the overall market? We can wash out lobbyist money by giving every 18+ yo citizen $100/year vouchers to donate to political campaigns.
11:30: Ban robo-calls; pay NCAA athletes; automation is eating capitalism; economy is based on a false growth model.
13:56: How do we pay for UBI? $3 tril cost - $1.2T overlap with welfare - $0.8T from tech VAT - $0.4T from economic stimulus revenue - $0.2T from emergency services savings - $0.4+T from eliminating poverty.
17:50: Yang's ethnicity impact on his chances
19:20: Foreign Policy on China
20:30: Future of jobs in Education, Healthcare, and Infrastructure
24:22: What do we replace automated jobs with?
26:20: General Foreign Policy approach
28:04: What's it like running for president? Meet lots of cool people; consumes your life.
29:55: What's the biggest foreign policy threat? China, AI, Climate Change.
31:30: How do we know people won't waste UBI on hookers and blow? We don't have to control their spending because it's their money (i.e. Freedom Dividend). It'll benefit the economy, regardless.
33:11: Why not jobs guarantee or robot tax, instead of UBI? Robot tax is hard to implement, FJG would be a complex, bureaucratic mess, and do nothing for entrepreneurship.
35:40: Would democracy dollars bias politicians against innovation? DD would better align tech with well-being of the people.
37:40: How would your policies affect the data market? I would give people ownership/control of their data and a cut of any use of it.
39:20: Wouldn't UBI cause price inflation/wage deflation? UBI doesn't remove cost-sensitivity so prices are still not determined by consumer wealth, but by competitor pricing.
41:37: Who should take the lead in impact/social investing and will it be sustainable/effective? There are many problems that don't have market solutions.
43:30: Green New Deals impact a small percent of global emissions, what about the rest? We'll export sustainable tech, tax imported pollution, and take measures to mitigate inevitable temp rise.
45:05: What about global sustainable tech? Subsidize sustainable tech, invest in mass carbon capture and sunlight reflecting tech.
46:00: Would you subsidize tech? Yes.
46:30: What's your plan for helping Puerto Rico? Forgive debt, let them choose to be a state or not, help rebuild hurricane damage, and encourage tourism there.
49:04: How do you get corporations on board with your taxes and are structural political changes needed? CEOs will be happy for increased business. Need to update gov.; Dem Dollars; term limits.
51:52: What advice would you give to students? Doing something meaningful is hard; you have to be resilient and determined but it's worth it.
53:20: What can we do to help with the big issues in our daily lives? Spend your money conscientiously and talk to people of different perspectives.
#####
Currently our school system does not teach financial literacy to our children. So when Andrew Yang becomes President, he will implement it into our school system from  k 1 to 12. It will teach our young people how to use /manage their money wisely. so when they receive  their Freedom Dividend money, they will use the money more effectively and make our young save more for their future.  Man, i can see Andrew Yang not just smart but very wise in his thorough thinking. We will be regret not to vote for him.

I have 3 adult kids in the house. There's 5 of us, so we are going to have an extra $60,000/year from UBI. That's goes a long damn way.
#####
He touches on why people don't move. For most people in the dying areas, their house is their most valuable or only asset, and they can't sell the house nor see themselves as able to sell the house, nor be able to afford a place to live wherever they'd have to go, certainly nothing nearly as comfortable as the place they know. People from foreign countries who have lost everything and have reached a level of desperation where they literally have nothing left to lose but their lives and families, are willing to grab opportunity without that feel of their domicile security.
#####
Bring on the Power Point, Andrew. Bring on the METRICS  that powerfully support your/our case to have EVERY BODY WIN. THEN we can show this dynamite material to all of the people we come across whom we wish to introduce to you and what you have for them and all of us. I just casually introduced you to three professionals in the banking industry WHO HAD NEVER HEARD OF YOU!! Unbelievable! They became instantly "sold" by sites I led them to on THEIR i-Phones. Then, I'm inspiring them to each inspire at least two more people. What do you call that? ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION?  EXPONENTIAL? Isn't that how we're going to get this thing DONE?

I just gave money to support Yang
#####
The way the political system works, the establishment of the Democratic Party along with the Republicans will try to crush Andrew Yangs candidacy.  Why?  Because he is running a campaign that has no identity politics, nothing about guns, gays and racism.  It‚Äôs all about the actual problem.  His book which is years ahead describes a highly stratified society like something out of the Hunger Games.  We are already witnessing working people struggling like they have never struggled before.

As an Assistant Professor I see the challenges of new graduates trying to find work. As a non-tenured faculty member, I work on a 9 month contract. So, in a way, I‚Äôm a gig worker that just happens to have a contract that has great benefits. Still, not being tenured, I understand that position is ‚Äútemporary‚Äù in nature. I love the concept of UBI.  My wife and I both have Masters degrees, and because of our age, it is not an advantage. More and more businesses want younger workers regardless of the decades of experience we have.

The average rent in the city cost over $1k , average cost to fill up your car is $40+, average monthly food cost for family of 4 is $400, average pay per hour is $12 they tell you inflation is less than 2% yet average family is squeezed financially to the point of poverty. I'm all for this new concept its the only way to rebalance this economic crisis...
#####
Red socks bring luck. Andrew Yang has both luck and talent.
#####
Yang is an incredible moron! If there is that much money than there is zero excuse to ever cut Social Security a dime ever!  Let the free loader earn theirs like those before them. All this idiot would do is inflate the shit out of our money and destroy those that already earned their Social Security ! As the idiot didn't think to include them. Remember Democrats stole the social security  money to fund their Vietnam war!  There are plenty of unfunded liabilities . Without starting a free bee give away for those that didn't earn it!  Yang is an idiot! LOOKING FOR SUCKERS! And the inflation he would cause would make our money worthless. I am sure China would love this idiots plan. Maybe he works for them!
#####
I am a software engineer and will vote for him! Yang2020!!!

I didn‚Äôt know any about him until the first debate. He‚Äôs swiftness in response impressed me. That make sense. Seeing all of his other interviews I find him totally presidential and very grounded. We need Andrew Yang to be the next President of the United States or else this country will sink at the rate that the trump administration is going. Andrew Yang is answer to our prayers.

Im still kind of worried about rent prices. Because rent prices are calculated based on a cimbination of median income of the region, and housing market value. Soo if suddenly everyone's income raises...even if the $1000 would not be counted as income would the inceeased income increase market prices which leads to increased rent?  I don't know.

YESS now we're talking, America finally presents a good candidate, This guy is a genius yet he's using common sense, Beat these oldies yo, the world needs to see true change, and your mind may be the key
#####
I'm a life long republican.  I 100% support Andrew Yang!
#####
I don't agree with many of his policies, but he is probably the most likable democratic candidate. (although that ain't saying much üòÇ)
#####
Both the Democrats and the Republicans have been so fixtated in fighting each other for so long that they have lost their way. How can they guide us, how can they lead us if they are only interested their own petty little war? It doesn't matter who wins this election today. A thousand years from now (if we haven't killed each other by then), we and all those who comes after us will still be trapped as in this vicious cycle as they are to the deteriment of the American people. Time for a change. Andrew Yang is for Humanity FIRST. Its NOT Left; Its NOT Right BUT FORWARD!! Andrew's heart is in the right place. Andrew Yang will be the one to break the cycle.
#####
He needs to win
#####
Andrew is the only one actually addressing the problem.
#####
Export trade for Andrew yang can impact on GDP economy growth, meanwhile it can make debt declined.
#####
This man actually does seem like a real life "Prez Rickard" who wants to create a better era for America.
#####
A man trying to give everyone a more even chance in the playing field if I personally got 1,000 a month I would be able to goto school and become and investor and get my family a chance to see poverty isn‚Äôt the only way to live
#####
I have donated more than 10 times. I can't stop donating to Andrew Yang's campaign because I know he needs the help to run the campaign for all of us underdogs to have better chances to win in life!
#####
No good can come from dividing Americans, and turning them against each other. Politicians that does this, obviously doesn't care about the damage it causes to our beloved nation. So as long as they get to rule over the ruins, they don't care. This right here alone should be a blind as a bat red flag when choosing a candidate, and referring to a fellow American as a enemy. Simply because we disagree with each other, is wrong in so many ways. Andrew Yang sets a fine example of how candidates, democrats, and republicans should conduct themselves. Bringing all Americans together as one nation. The Oval Office was meant for great leaders like Andrew Yang, and nothing less.
#####
Yang 2020. The US and the rest of the world need a POTUS who clearly understands and offers sensible solutions to both old problems and 21st century challenges that humanity faces. Yang is the man. 
    Yang 2020.
#####
OMG...I'm never tired of listening to Yang...is it just me or you too?
#####
why wouldnt you want an honest dude in office!! come on dude!!
#####
Andrew Yang is the smartest person to beat Trump.  Yang 2020.
#####
Once Bernie Sanders supporter, but moving to the Yang Gang. The 46th President of the United States of America, Andrew Yang!
#####
Nice!
#####
He did the MATH!!!!!!!
#####
No one else I plan to vote on except you Andrew Yang, my president!
#####
I changed my registration from Republican to Democrat, and I cannot be the only one...

When you strip the stigma of red from blue, of left from right, of the whole entire spectrum of political stances, then AY is the only one that still makes sense.

Yang2020 Humanity First!
#####
Yang gang from las vegas. Give the world a vision and watch the nay sayers be proven wrong. But can he beat the "system"
#####
Great vid!
#####
I am voting for Bernie Sanders because I trust him more than I trust anyone else running for office. Bernie has the receipts. Bernie created the Medicare For All on which others are hoping on board. But their plans are never as good. Why have a copy when you can have the original?

Bernie is working for working and middle class people. And Bernie has been here doing what Bernie can do when people like Yang were walking around in their diapers. I know Bernie is trusted. But Yang just said last week that he is more aligned with Joe Biden than any progressive running for president.

Yang is also taking corporate PAC money now.

I've seen enough of the Yangsters too, who care more about Yang than his policies.

I am voting for Bernie.
#####
Trump. Show your leadership so I can vote for you instead. If not?
#####
I love how he doesn't identify as a politician but a serial entrepreneur. I love his ideas and how he addresses things that no other candidate does such as mental health, health care, and student loans. As a 16 year old who's now looking into college, the cost has been a huge stress. To hear someone acknowledge how unreasonable the loans are feels amazing and I can't wait to see how he does.
#####
Voted for Bernie last go round but Yang has my support in 2020. He has the most innovative, well thought out solutions to so many issues. From ditching the penny to legalizing marijuana to basic income for all citizens, he's all about unity and moving the country forward.
#####
The automation in call centres and cashiers have already happened years ago. Not only in America, but around the world.
#####
Andrew Yang. The People's Champion.
#####
This guy has the ability to unify. He‚Äôs got balance. He can transcend rigid ideology. In energy terms he has both Yin and Yang Energy. I‚Äôll vote for him.
#####
This man is a light for america make it automated and let america think harder and harder... Im out...
#####
I am not sure if America is ready for an Asian president.
#####
I like yang. He's not a socialist. He just want capitalism that works.
#####
In yang we ‚ÄúTRUST‚Äù!!
#####
We need Yang to canvas Florida.
#####
I‚Äôm a conservative republican that being said, Mr. Yang you have my undivided attention and I am listening.
#####
I'm Australian, and this man seems like the most sensible candidate for your president. All solutions and no bullshit. Don't screw this up America, get him in the white house.

Keep the momentum going people, I honestly think it's up to us spreading his name on social media to increase his following because TV won't give him enough air time.
#####
He is cool.
#####
Will this guy make america smart and rational again..?


Man I don't know. It's really entertaining to watch US political fields.
#####
Yang has no stand on illegal immigration or a border wall. The Democrats are not going to allow Yang to give money to the people...Democrats raise taxes to spend freely. Yang is making promises that he will NOT be able to fill.

A campaign based on old ideas ideas....   Thomas Paine ( author of 'Common Sense')  put the idea forth of giving each person an income at 21 years old, 250 years age!  Nothing more than a scheme to bribe taxpayers into voting for something they think they will get more out of than paying into.  Of course, the non-taxpayer cares little, as they are getting a free ride no matter what.  Eventually,  the taxes rise and the free lunch is over.  


The next trick, up the sleeve is the promise then the results (after successful gravy train life in office is obtained) come out.  The average taxpayer is means-tested right out of the very program they voted for. Every program ever voted sets a ridiculous lower end income level that  only allows a select few to qualify. 


Lastly, the monthly payment scheme presented here has one other flaw.  Explain how this scheme has not worked so well in the modern welfare system in the country.  Just look around America and you will see the results of wealth transfer, the more free stuff you give, the less the individual builds a life of independence.  


What you are really doing is voting for a life of poverty across the board, with the sole except of the ruling class. Just look around the world and see the result of wealth transfer schemes and you see the grocery shelves bare ant the continued existence of the presidential palaces.

ANDREW YANG -- RICHARD OJEDA 2020. Time to put Trump's dick in the dirt and dare him to turn over.
A wise businessman and a bad ass paratrooper combat veteran who made his way up through the ranks from Private to Major. Knuckle up, Trump! Here comes Yang and Ojeda!.

To the haters, why not him? Why not put us first before the politicians? Having lived in the DC area, politicians are completely disconnected with everyday struggling Americans. He's not conventional but he makes sense. Go Yang Go!

This video needs to blow up again. It's very good. #YANG2020

I have never believed in voting and I AM VOTING because I BELIEVE IN ANDREW YANG! #YANGGANG

I'd love to see yang call out the debate for the theatrical farce that it is while on the debate stage

THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE United States OF America!
#####
Donald Trump is a huge divider.  Americans your problem solver is Andrew Yang.  Make him your president.

Gold has high value because there is very little of it when you print that much money and put it in everybody's hands and everybody has it then where's the value The more money there is the less it is worth inflation will skyrocket As the American dollar tumbles

#####
Please change this to " a campaign with legitimate ideas". We need these ideas in the Democratic platform.
#####
My presidential predictions have been 100% correct since President Ronald Reagan - If Yang climbs to the top tier by the July Debate, he then becomes our President in 2020.
#####
We're with you, Andrew Yang!
#####
Leon cooperman on CNBC mentioned his financial services industry is about to lose 40% of jobs due to automation. The hosts tried to change the subject

His trickle-up economy empowered by freedom dividend will solve a lot of social problems facing us today and beyond. 
 Current economic system makes many people falling into desperate situations and the cost can't be calculated.

People are sooo worried about what other people will do with the UBI, but it doesn't matter. What matters is what will YOU do with your UBI? If YOU decided to get liquor or cigarettes with it, that's fine. That's on you. I will use mine to help pay off my mortgage a little faster.
#####
I would drag my dick through a mile of broken glass just to vote for this man.
#####
Andrew is awakening political activity in reasonable people who had always been labeled by the mainstream as "apolitical". Most human beings are not apollitical. They are just waiting for the right kind of leader to come along. Andrew Yang's 'not left, not right, forward' messaging (which is selfless, since it's not exactly the sort of phrase that will endear one to any veteran party member) will hit home for millions overlooked for decades by the two major parties whose main raison d'√™tre seems to be mindless partisan growling.

#####
A bit artificial listing Puerto Rico statehood and federal anti-addiction funding as 2 of his key issues, but I respect that he has a lot of strong policies and that his concept of Human-Centered Capitalism is hard to get across in a 50-second clip.
#####
Yangs top 3 proposals are actually:
1) Freedom dividend of $1000 per month to every American adult
2) Medicare for all. Phasing out private insurance
3) Human centered capitalism, where GDP is not the only measurement of national well-being.
#####
Thanks. But you can keep your money, pal. I‚Äôll work for mine.
#####
I‚Äôd prefer him over any of the democratic candidates any day

Yang gang, where you at?
#####
Some of my friends say they won‚Äôt vote for him because he has held no political office. But that‚Äôs one of the reasons why I‚Äôll vote for him. He is pure hearted, wise and uncorrupted. I‚Äôll take a chance that he‚Äôll stay that way.
#####
The only candidate who knows how to solve problems.  Democrats do yourselves a favour, nominate Andrew Yang and make him your president.
#####
I agree to make Puerto Rico a state! No other candidates has touched on that!
#####
Fortune, next time, I want to see more and better, smh.
#####
I‚Äôm gonna vote all over Andrew Yang! Andrew Yang 2020!!
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Trump 2020. Yang is for a UBI. Sorry but the USSR already tried UBI and it failed miserably.
#####
If you don't vote for him. You potentially will be losing out on a $1000 a month (UBI Freedom Dividend), not including all the other good policies he has on his website.
#####
Yang is a Capricorn which makes him good for the position of POTUS 
he has natural talent for problem solving and management
#####
Yang!
#####
Yang is ranked #6 right now by Oddshark to win.  Expect him to move up.
#####
I'm a white male Trump voter and I'm voting Yang
#####
Partisan hacks hate Yang, regardless of party.  Reasonable, logical thinkers of the right and left adore him. He is one of us - or at least what we aspire to be.
#####
No politician will fix our problems. It's all empty promises and lies. Stop complying with the theft of taxation and paying for your own slavery. Stop voting for idiots who are clueless puppets of the state.

The only danger to humanity is man himself
Thursday, January 1st, 2015 @ 23:50
My dearly beloved daughter, the person who perseveres in prayer will become closer to Me.
With so much confusion in the world and amongst My Church on earth, the challenge for humanity is to be able to differentiate between right and wrong in the Eyes of God. But, for many Christians, they will be drawn away from Me by a new global form of evangelisation, which will focus exclusively on politics. Instead of being encouraged to remain loyal to Me and trusting in all that I Am, you will be pulled away from Me. You must never confuse My Word with the aspirations of a secular world. I have always made it clear to humanity, through My Father‚Äôs Book, of the dangers in doing so. A secular world serves only its own needs and men of power, ambition and selfish aspirations create the rules, which govern it.
So much misinformation has been spread in relation to the environment, when only God can dictate how the earth behaves. Man may harm and damage the earth but he can never destroy it, for all these things are in the Hands of God. A lack of trust in God means that man believes he has control over the universe. The foolish man thinks that his actions can change God‚Äôs Laws. The wise man knows that God is All Powerful and as long as He is revered, and His Laws adhered to, then man‚Äôs survival will be secured. The survival of the earth has nothing to do with mortal man. Only God has the power to control the air that you breathe; the water you drink and the ability to sustain life. The only danger to humanity is man himself.
Man will fool others in the interests of self-gain. He will lie if it is to his advantage and when it suits him. Trust is easily broken and now you are living in an era where you must know that the earth will remain as it was before and that any climate upheaval is by the Hand of God. Man‚Äôs intervention in such a divine creation will only be permitted if it is according to the Will of God.
My Church is My Body. All those who believe in Me are part of My Body. Those who are part of Me will follow My Teachings. Those who say they lead My followers must abide by the Word of God. Their role is to defend the Truth ‚Äì not deviate from it.
If you are being pulled away from Me, and if My Word is being rejected by the world, then the duty of My sacred servants is to remind the world of what is right and what is wrong. When they remove themselves from matters, which concern the soul in exchange for matters, which amount to socialism, then know that this is a subtle and cunning deception. It also betrays all trust in Me.

Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
So is Paul Yin his evil opposite?  It's a yin/yang thing folks.
#####
Andrew once spoke to a group of republicans, said things like "some of those truck drivers are marines," "politicians walked away from me," "idk why i was the only one who brought my family," "i did really well on standardized tests, i took econ, i got an A...," "i have 2 kids, they aren't "tough" if you know what i mean, and i want to make this world better, so its better for them..." Andrew always felt stereotyped as a minority, but at the same time, while he was conscious of this stereotype, those stereotyping him were not, but Andrew may have thought that they were.  this is why minorities think some whites are racist, because the minority is conscious of the biases, but the whites are not, but the minorities are not conscious of the unconsciousness of the whites-they think the whites are conscious of their own behavior because the minorities are conscious of it...uhhh, people everywhere need more consciousness.

#####
This guy really cares about humanity. The other dems only care about power and their checkbook.
#####
Super stoked about this guy. First Democrat I‚Äôve ever been really impressed with during a campaign and first candidate I‚Äôve ever supported financially. UBI is the simplest, fairest, cheapest, and most efficient way to accomplish many of the progressive goals that will make American society a much better place without all the silly ideas peddled by most democrats like minimum wage hikes. Love seeing a data driven and independent thinking candidate for once.
#####
He‚Äôs officially making the debate stage!
#####
Hes better than the generic race baiting npc democrat thats for sure.
#####
Yang is like the Huey Long in 2019
#####
Making Puerto Rico a state is what really got me. Go Yang!

An entrepreneur should know better than implementing UBI and Medicare for All...
#####
Yang me up senpai
#####
I was saying something similar back in the early 90s, but my idea was to give every family One Million dollars, but only families. You decide how many children you want, or whether you want to break laws and leave the life you‚Äôre living. This may sound a little crazy, but it could be a great thing if done right. Many possibilities!! Me. Yang wants to give every person 1000 dollars, that‚Äôs nothing. Oh, and one more thing, no more welfare.
#####
Erm, saying "wants U.B.I." is true enough but "$1K/mo. for adult citizens" would even more factual and infinitely more helpful!!
#####
Maybe 2024
#####
He has no experience in government and is to young, and will never receive the backing Bernie will
#####
If you don't want to work, VOTE for Yang...
#####
The only way Andrew Yang can even have the opportunity to get on stage and debate is if he has enough of a following to do so. As of now he is short a few $1 donations in order to have enough "contributors" to get on stage and compete.


Who ever is serious about voting for him,  I urge you to visit his website and donate at least just one dollar:

if you are interested to know more about Yang,  please check out his comprehensive Policies on his website, also, please consider to give him $1.00,  if he has 65,000 donors, he will have a chance to participate Democratic Debates in June and make his case to American People. We need to hear him debate these career politicians.

"You don't seem like a politician." That says a lot of Andrew Yang. More than a politician, he is the real leader.
#####
Humanity first üíï
#####
"I have to follow you now..." Love it. Follow what's right.
#####
I would vote for Yang if he wasn‚Äôt  representing the democrats.
#####
I love that he's represented... Really, it's a great occupation to represent so many on the same rung, currently, economically. But I beg to differ...blue collar workers didn't build this country. They are perpetually pivotal in maintaining it, for sure. But, regardless of this idea that Yang doesn't want to talk about the race division, it needs to be talked about, NORMALIZED and the credit for the BUILDING of this country needs to go to the populations still most oppressed today; the black and indigenous communities. The Indigenous people lost everything and continue to be picked at today, and have been since each treaty was loosely written. The Black communities were forced to be here, lost their LINEAGE (something Yang says he's proud of as the first Asian running), ENSLAVED to erect a new nation from a stolen nation and it's their shoulders every blue collar worker represented for today's votes, continue to walk upon. Insomuch as they STILL believe they've built this country. -You were never given the option...your forefathers made certain of that when they convinced your great great grandfathers to look down upon and harm the melaninated people for undue gains. Your great grandfathers were no better and the fight for equality and reparations is still in its infancy. -Yang polls low with the black community...he says he needs to talk with them in order to win them over... Granted, eliminating private prisons, giving the felons back their vote are great starts but, there's room for much more. Let's not just "study" reparations. Let's study WHICH reparations, utilizing the communities that are due them and get them allocated. If we all know what to do with $1,000/m in order to help our own economy stolen from us, what makes you think those deserving equal footing in a stolen and forcely built nation would do any worse?
#####
Don‚Äôt believe it. Better ask him how much money he get pay for simpler.  Hahaha.

Big pharma, oil corporations, wall street, and mega banks had accumulated most of the wealth of the earth.  They must give it up or we all end up homeless and hungry!  Jefferson warned us about the mega banks

I'm a young architect with a decent income.  When I receive that $1,000 check every month , I will give that money back into wildlife conservation and environmental restoration .  I'm a simple person who doesn't need much cash nor materials , I'm voting for Andrew Yang not because of the $1,000 check but because he is ahead of our time , he is ahead of all politicians , he is kind and incredibly smart , and he's pro humanity ...  he's also wise and calm so he can win international issues for the US ...

i sent you a twitter message about this very thing.

Yang's two big drawbacks: 
1. Does not have any international politics experience or policies. War's bad is good but who would be his potential allies?
2. His "revolutionary freedom dividend" is largely funded by a regressive added value tax that will hit poorest people the hardest. It moves the money in the economy around, but does not redistribute income or wealth. The fact he never explains to people what an added value tax is - ie a tax on literally everything, should tell you enough.

This guy is sold out, just recently, he is a fucking liar , he's not for Medicare for all, he's plan not even for single-payer system, which is stepping stone for Medicare for all, his bullshiting with stupid Ubi which is absolutely have no credibility in economic points of view,  you take taxes from everyone to the bottom level of their income , you can increase level untaxed low income,  but then inflation will eat over that 1000 Ubi in matter of month. overall you cannot give back $1,000 to people who paid taxes more than $1,000 per person that system is not work, its total bullshit! Now he's only worked as a spoiler who will hold bodes from Bernie Sanders he is not going to ever be in be able to nominee became to nominee which means he's going to divide Bernie Sanders support Isaiah better younger-looking person but he is political and economical stand is not progressive at all now he's only work as a spoiler who will pulled bulbs from Bernie Sanders he's not going to ever be in be able to nominee became to nominee which means he's going to divide burner Sanders support as a better younger looking person but he is political and economical stand is not progressive adderal he's a good guy I assumed but he's not who he is he said go back to your business!

As an undecided voter at this point; looking at the field. It is either Yang or Trump. Yang if he can make it.
#####
This made me cry, the gentleman spoke the truth.  No one cares about the dwindling middle class.  We can't and shouldn't stop progress, but we do need to remember our humanity.  Like Mr. Yang ,institute big bold ideas like UBI ,create for the first time a trickle up  economy.  A human centered society.  Everyone has value .

The blue color workers are the backbone of the country , not billionaires or millionaires etc but these guys who drive all over the country thru all kinds of hazardous weather , sometimes sleeping in their trucks simply because they need to be as frugal as possible especially when they have a wife and kids at home depending on them . They do whatever overtime they can get their hands on so that that extra money just might help put the kids thru collage and it‚Äôs sad when I see these people because they are good people and they side as hell deserve better !

That was pretty staged, as in, fake.

the FACT that a trump tard likes Yang is ENOUGH to make me distrust and dislike Yang..

I mean yes i agree this point but i cant get align with his idea to 
reform our constitution and 2nd amendment. If you tamper with any of the
 bill of rights your messing with the biggest stepping stones that 
allowed many of us Americans get ahead and become a great country. 
Andrew please dont go against my Amendment Rights and we can Talk. Deal 
with Issues not Rights. People who havent seen his talk about 2nd 
Amendment and Constitution Reform ideas please do so. I got shocked 
hearing it from him. It gave me doubts. I didnt vote for Trump, I am 
Democrat Affiliated but wondering right now I thought i could with Yang 
but now I am Not Sure. Just Not Sure. We need to stand together as 
Americans for someone who fixes our actual core issues and take a step 
backwards away from Infringement of our Rights. My heart goes out to 
Virginia Gun Ban. New York trying to do the same along with California. 
We talking about States who dont care about its citizens instead of 
fixing economical issues and actual root issues like bullying in schools
 and single parent households being made like normal. If your a single 
woman they tell you to stay that way because your strong and need to be 
independent and the government will provide financial help but please I 
saw my mother struggle she needed help we need good men to support good 
women to build a better family structure and building a better future 
for our young kids growing up. I was raised good thanks to a strong 
family. Uncles who where good role models from engineers and military 
people to in home dads. Its about a United America. United States of 
America. Key word is United. We need our rights untouched and to work 
together to form solutions. Bill of Rights leave it alone. Make more 
Constitutional Rights like the right for us to look into Police 
Investigations more closely to be disclosed to the public should be a 
good. How about Open Book of Earnings of these politicians who serve us 
the people and we see if they get a pay increase and why and where is 
the money coming from. This should be open for us to see. Not for us to 
wonder and do research on. We all have to become investigators to do 
this sht its ridiculous they work for us not the other way around.

I'm a massive Trump fan and from what I can see, Yang can go toe to toe with Trump in 2020 but will struggle to win the Democratic primaries, which is the biggest irony of all.
#####
The problem is that even tho trump supporters would for yang . The dnc won‚Äôt let him win . Hence the likely opponent to trump will be someone the establishment wants and hence those voters will stick with trump . Or they might pick someone so far left that it even drives reasonable democrats into trumps arms

#####
The driver's seatbelt is so dirty compared to Andrew's seatbelt, Andrew's a clean cut all American guy and should be the next president
#####
I got nothing against Yang. I think a Sanders/Yang ticket would be awesome. Realistically he won't have as much of a chance at winning as a guy like Bernie. Then his followers will help re-elect Trump by writing him in or staying home.
#####
I am rooting for yang. I am not even American.
#####
I can totally relate to this guy I to voted for Trump. I to feel that Democrats don't really care about the average person any more and that's sad because the Democrats used to be the party of The working Man but that was my grandpa's party not my party. However, Andrew Yang is the only one that could move this country forward. And I will vote for him hands down.

There is never going to be a nominee that will 100% align with all your beliefs and values, but that doesn't mean u should cut them off entirely. America constantly changes, too much actually, which causes Americans to change too much as well in general as well as who they vote for, cause once a person is President and we dnt see any changes in our lives, we say oh, it's the President fault. Let's remember when we vote, let's not think this one person is going to fix everything, but tht you personally have to make some adjustments in your own life

I've never seen Trump do this.

We need prescription heroin and safe injection sites. Canada is ahead of the United States regarding this issue but I believe Yang Gang can help us achieve what Canada has already done! I will vote for you in 2020 with the hopes we can have prescription heroin for those suffering from addiction!

Hey Yang, should my tax dollars go support Alcoholics for free alcohol?  Afterall it's a sickness not a choice right?
#####
The false assumption made here by Mr. Yang is that a pill causes addiction.  I guess that if he can state, for example, that a bottle of beer causes alcoholism, then it can be assumed that with this amount of ignorance, Mr. Yang can also assume that a pill causes addiction.  Unfortunately, his assumptions are all too prevalent in at the current time in society.  He said nothing about the "Untreated Pain Crisis" in this country that his type of assumptions have contributed to, and lead to on-going suicides by so many people in pain who had their medications stopped.  He definitely need to address the fake "opioid crisis" that has been created in order for the government to systematically (and in secret) make changes to out health care system.  These facts are documented in the following Dossier:


http://fileserver.idpc.net/library/violationofanationdossierfinal.pdf


The government officials responsible for doing this to the most vulnerable portion of our population need to be identified and held accountable.  If you don't think that this is any of your concern, I would point out that the changes to our health care system are still going on, that these violations will be expanded until everyone in the populace will feel the impacts.
#####
Decriminalization will lead to more opiod use. This is a very bad idea, and deadly.
#####
What is the non addictive substitute that France is using? Buprenorphine being able to be perscribed by any MD?

If you try to take away opioids. You're just asking for more uranium-tipped bullets that were used in the middle East to be ground up and put right back into your water supply again. Why doesn't the government address that issue.
#####

#####
Andrew, can you protect chronic pain patients that need more than 90 MME/day of opioids as this limit by the Trump administration is hurting many chronic pain patients while doing nothing as the actual abusers do not have chronic pain at all? Also the CPPs are committing suicide as it's inhumane to take their pain medication that works away from them. It is cruel and stupid for people to blame legal opioids let alone the doctors being scapegoated as they had nothing to do with the crisis as it's the drug dealers supplying it.
#####
oxycontin is a long-winded way to make smack, (from thebaine, an opium alkaloid). Technically not heroin, but so close, it would have been a lot cheaper to just market smack. buts thats not how the plutocracy works?, is it?.

Addicts need immediate access to no barrier treatment and Purdue should pay for it.  Inexpensive treatment and the Freedom Dividend would go a long way to address homelessness.  Opioid addiction costs the economy billions of dollars in lost productivity, public health and law enforcement resources, not to mention over 50,000 American lives every year. Despite this national emergency, no one is doing anything about it.  Andrew Yang is the only Presidential candidate with a solution for the problem

Andrew, please consider looking into ibogaine as an effective treatment for opioid addiction. It's legal in Canada and Mexico, but not the US. Eliminates cravings and withdrawal symptoms within 24-36 hours and does not need to be taken again after treatment. As with all treatments, establishing an environment for the patient afterwards that does not push them back into the situation that caused them abuse opioids in the first place is paramount.

Andrew, your proposal of $1,000 per month for every American citizen is excellent.

Gotta get out and vote, people! Andrew Yang seems to be a promising prospect. We can't let that orange pig back in office!
#####
I've been on the fence for awhile now. I spent the last election season... well... the last 20 years of my life if I'm honest, frustrated. I'm fuckin angry dude. between my families being enslaved to things like poverty, and drug addiction.. where do I turn? I am that aimless 20 something year old you spoke about on Sam Harris podcast. but I know I have so much to offer. I feel like men my age, we grew up in such a strange time. one foot in the past, one foot in this technological take over. a lot of us kind of feel left behind. left to clean up the mess from the boomer generation, that doesnt seem to care about us. not in society. not in politics. were even painted as pariahs almost. I cant live a day of my life where "the millenials" are not blamed for something, or talked about as if a burden. we ARE aimless, a lot of us. but that's okay, I have aspirations. I just dont have a solid foundation to start from. i work my fuckin ass off. but I barely tread water. even a small emergency could be catastrophic for me. its terrifying, because we feel like our entire existence is tenuous at best. but I listen to your plans, I hear what you're saying. and I dont want to be on the fence anymore. I want, need that foundation to build on and I know I could be someone that can achieve great things.

this election season will be the fourth time I've had the right to vote for my president. I have hope this will be the first time that it will be a pleasure. it's still early in the game, but it seems you have my vote. and it will be the first time I will have voted Democrat. I just want to say thank you for working to be a voice for a lost generation that isnt being heard.
#####
Hello Andrew, please be careful when mentioning Sackler family, you aren't allowed to attack Jewish people or Jewish families. People might compare you to Patrick Little, who is also running as a Democrat in 2020. Another Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ,Tulsi Gabbard and James Trafficent have also in trouble for mentioning Jewish people. Becareful not to get endorsed by former Democrat David Duke. 
Green party Cynthia McKinney also got in trouble. If you mention Jewish people, just be aware that you may get in trouble.
#####
The president of the United States should be someone who will make decisions based upon the available facts.¬† Someone who will respect and uphold our nations laws and our fundamental right to due process.

Andrew Yang is clearly not such a person and therefore should not become president.

00:16. 

Yang states that he is thrilled that the Sackly family is being sued, thus injecting personal bias into his actions.

00:48 

Yang continues his long standing narrative that rich people owe something to poor people.¬† That to become rich they must have somehow exploited someone.

00:58 

Yangs solution to any precieved injustice is to extract money from those he feels to be responsible. The rich.

1:00 

It took Yang a full 60 seconds but he finally got around to blaming capitalism for the opioid crisis.¬† 

Yang.¬† Greed might be at the root of the opioid crisis - that is for the courts to decide - but capitalism does not cause greed.¬† People dont need capitalism to be greedy. 

Suppose for example one presidential candidate wanted to recieve more votes than any of the other candidates. Greedy? 

That person might simply offer the American people a bribe in exchange for their votes.¬† A "dividend"?


1:20 

No president should distort public opinion through exaggeration. Candidate Yang does.

Yang refers to the opioid crisis as a plague.

The opioid epidemic or opioid crisis is the rapid increase in the use of prescription and non-prescription opioid drugs in the United States and Canada beginning in the late 1990s 

In contrast.

A plague is a contagious bacterial disease characterized by fever and delirium, typically with the formation of buboes ( bubonic plague ) and sometimes infection of the lungs ( pneumonic plague ).

It is dishonest to exagerate events in order to sway an outcome.

1:42. 

Yang further expounds upon how thrilled he is that the Sackley family - in his own words - is being brought to justice.

It doesnt matter to Yang that there hasnt been a trial and that no verdict has been handed down.

Yang stands completely outside the law when he condemns the Sackley's as being completely criminal and immoral for what he believes they have done to the American people.

Guilty before the trial has even begun.

Is Andrew Yang really the kind of person Americans want in the White House?

If so then what does that say about we Ameicans?

Are we a country of vigilantes? 

Is every American on the take?

Or are Americans the true champions of liberty and justice for all?

Your votes will decide.

Hey Andrew. The problem isn't the drug in itself, the problem is the withheld information about it, and the ginormous money you can make from withholding that information. If we take away the patent system, drugs will be cheaper, profits smaller, and rate of R&D will be sped up cause you can't make money on the same drug for 25 years anymore. Also, if you legalize all drugs, as a true freedom loving person would do, you could let people choose their own drug of choice instead of being in the hands of the pharma industry. With your basic income, people would have time to research and do their own assessments of what is right or wrong for their particular situation. We are the ones who know ourselves best, except for AI.

Andrew Yang for President 2020.
#####
You got my vote Yang.
#####
I would say that these sorts of things need to come with prison time and not just fines. Say, for every $100 million a company is fined for harm it caused the public, the CEO and chairman of the board get 1 year in jail, and the CFO and all other members of the board get 1 month in jail. When the people at the top have the fear of jail in their hearts, they're far less likely to be reckless for the sake of higher profits...
#####
If every American receives a thousand dollar check a month that‚Äôs 265 mill at a thousand a pop each month= 2,915,000,000,000 that is feasible? Where would the funds come from, the education department No your about learning, private sectors no that creates more big business in politics, the ever inflating military budget watch yourself that‚Äôs dangerous waters there, you got lobbyist big business and the war machine on your ass now, oh lest we forget we are brainwashed into thinking America needs to be spread out like a virus. But what you say is not feasible unless your getting it from investors, but what are they getting in return..
#####
Kind of winning me over Mr. Yang.. I‚Äôm going to go through and do my research on you. I did all my research on Trump before this stage and found out before it all came out the man couldn‚Äôt do business and was frankly a liar.. Right now Bernie has my vote, but I am an entrepreneur and I don‚Äôt agree much with his policies.
#####
So good. Succinct, emotional, persuasive
#####
Andrew, you are a hero!
#####
Andrew Yang is the only person smart enough to beat Trump.  He will make the lives of Americans better.  Yang 2020.
#####
$1000 for every American adult 18 + age is a way to go and we all will win .He will get my vote !
#####
Look at this idea. Say a group of building trades guys in Detroit got together and took their ubi and flipped house.
#####
Andrew Yang should challenge Donald Trump in a debate trounce him in such debate and then proceed to win the democratic nomination. There must be a way to get Andrew Yang past the DNC whatnot.
#####
Yes Yang Can - half the world is waiting for him
#####
This is exactly the wording he has to use on stage. This was better than his usual routine.
#####
grow the YangGang!  political innovation and entrepreneurship makes sense. yang adopts his business sense with social responsibility and vision.

This is the first time that I've heard Yang frame this as taking money from centers of capital, he references "Seattle and the coasts" here, and infusing it back into flyover country.  I think some of his left-leaning critics don't understand the impact of millions of dollars a month on rural and rustbelt local economies.  The average income in the former factory town that I grew up in is less than $19,000/yr. with prospects declining.
#####
AY is too smart for americans...
#####
Andrew Yang has my vote and my contributions to his campaign!
#####
Andrew Yang is the easiest to understand, simple, elegant, razor sharp intellect.  No other candidate lie him ever.  Americans do yourselves a favour; make Andrew Yang your president.
#####
Yang and Tulsi 2020.  UBI for Americans.  Aloha

Everyone blew off Ross Perot in 92 as a kook... but his predictions came true...time people woke up and start listening to this guy ... because he is right... automation is coming and quick... my cousin works for a company in silicon valley....and according to him ... the things we are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg .... we can not even imagine what is coming and soon...

This idea just to VAT the super-rich corporations and then give 1k to everyone is ridiculous. It needs to be based on the cost of living for each state.  Those in NY or LA should get more...those in the country in Alabama less...otherwise it makes no sense.  Los Angeles is 111% more expensive than Huntsville Alabama.  A salary of $70,000 in Alabama should be $148,000 in LA...thats why is not fair.  Is everyone supposed to move to Huntsville...or Iowa?  LA is 127% more expensive than Des Moines.  Of course this looks great in IOWA.
#####
Who benefit the most from UBI? 
-Citizens who do not work and do not qualify for welfare or unemployment benefits.

-Citizens who do work at home taking care of kids, sick, and elderly etc. 

-Full time volunteering citizens. 

-20 million college students.

-$1000 will have a big positive impact on low income citizens.

-Citizens on welfare will see less impact increase benefits are capped at $1000.

If hes not president where fucked
#####
Andrew Yang! The Prez!
#####
this guy is too good for the usa. should emigrate to denmark. would fit right in. usa? seems very unlikely. he's saying to every vested interest, "hey, you're doing it wrong."
he leaves the word, 'socialism, ' out, but many people are going to fill it in for him. interesting to see how far he gets.
#####
Extremely refreshing to see some candidate truthfully identify problems and then propose reasonable but bold solutions.
#####
once in a generation genius #math
#####
Once Yang gets on the debate stage he will absolutely win the hearts and minds of voters!
#####
Yang is the mang!
#####
This guy is a pie in the sky sprinkled with Fairy dust kind of man. It's the stuff fairy tales are made of.
#####
support support!
#####
truly amazing, it would be insane not to vote for him
#####
Pie in the sky progressive left policies that HARM American middle class, Obama care you can keep your doctor and save 2500.00 a year Nope total LIE my health ins went up sky high. I am VOTING for President Trump in 2020 he kept his promises, a business man he is NOT a RINO, Socialist, globalist inside the beltway same old neocon/neolib uni party
#####
You paint a doomsday scenario, and then pull out a butter knife to fight the problem.
#####
On point with the problems that small biz owners face
#####
He's a billionaire who needs a better tailor.  His suit doesnt fit him.  The neck area looks bad.  He looks uncomfortable thats why he is leaning forward like this.
#####
crazy that neither party will talk about this #Yang2020
#####
This guy will just waste large sums of money to NEVER win, no enthusiasm etc
#####
This guy is a fraud, he doesn‚Äôt even understand the underlying causes I‚Äôm sorry
#####
The more I hear this guy talk, the more sense he makes. Hope he gets his fair share of talking time at the debates
#####
He will get my vote this guy is smart actually knows his facts about business in this country no doubt but he really needs to expand on other issues an find away onto main media
#####
One of the saddest reality is, our country will not elect man like this.     
The country will elect another donald duck.
#####
i think he care the rich more then the 99%.. although he is democrat.. another spy from the commie?
#####
1:34 to 2:12 is why capitalism/markets are socially destructive.
to get ahead you have to do objectionable things others/your community.
There's your answer for the mental illness epidemic plaguing this country and the flight away from capitalism towards socialism.
#####
You got my vote, Andrew! Pumped!
#####
Is that all this guy has got a big give away. $1000 a month to every adult would increase the poverty level to 50 or 80 thousand dollars a year. And what about inflation.
#####
U really need to cut out "like"

Yang fully admits that the problem isnt AI taking away jobs.

The real problem is that Americans are not prepairing themselves to transition to a new career should they face replacement by automation.

He tells us that 70% of Americans do not have a college degree.

The mean incomes by educational level.

Less than high school¬† $25,636 per year. 

With a high school diploma $35,256 per year. 

Some college and no degree $38,376 per year. 

With an associate‚Äôs degree $41,496 per year.

With a bachelor‚Äôs degree $59,124 per year. 

With a professional degree $89,960 per year. 


So you see there is a simple solution.


Have A Plan If You Plan To Have.
#####
How could he possibly know how many jobs would be created?

What about the young adults who would rather live with two or three roomates - all collecting UBI - and just play xbox and smoke dope all day rather than work a minimum wage job?

What happens to those businesses  that rely upon young adults earning starter wages to keep their doors open once their labor pool dries up?

Some will be able to automate.  Others will close.

There will be plenty of young adults who will continue living in their parents basement - not going to school to earn a degree to get a job that they believe will get automated away from them in the end anyway - and just collect their check.

Thats sad.

You and your ilk crush the hopes and dreams of people with your endless fear mongering.

Amazon is not the problem.

Americans are not as helpless as Yang and the Democrats would have them believe.

Yang tells the American people that the reason why the shops on their main streets are closing is because of the big bad Amazon.

Some Americans actually agree with him.

Dont any of them realize that they are the reason for the shops going out of business?

They placed the orders with Amazon from the comfort of their own homes rather than drive down town and spend their money in the local economy.

They are the main reason that the shops closed and now their children have no place to work over the summer.

There is no one to blame but the American citizenry. 

Stop shopping on Amazon or at Walmart and eventually the local shops will return and with them the jobs and the economic prosperity of the community.

Or. Americans can just embrace their victimhood and let the government take care of them.

Demoncrats do love victims.

You got my vote Andrew, lets share this far and wide, awesome videos btw.

Every 4 years, the wealthy spend billions to trick the American electorate to choose one of their candidates.  Make their purchase invalid this time.

I hope they run this in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Whether you are voting for him or not can see that Andrew Yang has found a healthy, grounded, wholesome part of his personality to live in and live by.  He has a new perception of community for America.  The only way to change the world is to change yourself and Andrew Yang is using his personality to serve his greater calling.  We are each vehicles of Global Transformation.  I‚Äôm so inspired to know that someone like Andrew Yang has stepped forward, he‚Äôs going to change America and will be the marker for others to step forward (there are more like him) but not running for President!!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this, is the beginning of a Better Future for Mankind!

I clicked this link because the the guy in the thumbnail looks like Seth Rogen and I thought I was about to see Seth Rogen endorse Andrew Yang.


Sticked around cuz the feels

Too bad nobody knows about him and white corporate america, DNC prefer Biden over ANYONE else.
#####
Good character is what is most important in a president... for this reason (and many others), I am voting for Yang!!!
#####
Tell me people what can we do, I do to get this man into office we need the poles now he has the donations he just needs the poles.
#####
Andrew Yang:
‚ÄúI am not running for president because I fantasize about ever being president.  I am running for president because I am an American and a parent, and I can see the country we will leave to our children (where capitalism and democracy are both outta whack and failing its people), and it is not something I am willing to accept !‚Äù

Facing the greatest socioeconomic challenge and change of our time over the next 10 years, where the American people will navigate through the 4th industrial revolution (the rise of AI/robotics/advance automation) , Andrew Yang is the man on a mission to help transition this country to a humanity based economy and to restore political power back to its people...
#####
Andrew doesn't just practice what he preaches, he lives it and puts humanity first.

#####
This message speaks to me. As a low income family, even having a dental check-up is way too expensive for my family and traveling over to Korea to get a dental procedure done is a whole lot cheaper than here. A $1000 as dividend income is nothing compared to the thousands and millions of dollars Americans currently pay for health, college, and housing.
#####
That's some sad ass shit. Yaaaang gonna save me from withdrawal. Gonna get me my blow. Vote yang or die.
#####
Didn't Yang say his friends in silicon Valley are making robotics to take over our jobs.. So he's going to go against his friends? Doubt it. The plan doesn't seem logical. Along with UBI universal health care that's inevitable to fail. Look at Europe same thing one by one failed. Finland yesterday officially. Next will be.. We all already know this is your freedom worth it in the big picture especially if your a gun owner. He flip flopped goes but its still the same difference gun control gun restrictions. Look at democratic CA did w gun restrictions its gun control, and your guns will be illegal. Keep voting doors  "light" socialist Democrats in and we will be back to where we were but much worse. Pure logic says it all.

This was in Baltimore and I got to see him there. It was brave for this man to share his story but I don't think it was right for the campaign to use it in this way and I think that a lot of the types of voters that would like Andrew Yang would be turned off by this type of politics. It feels insincere and also at that early stage of the campaign I would have thought he would have seen that the audience was full of supporters and tried to maybe hear ideas and get us all talking as a group about what we want for our country and got us to get to know each other so we could be local volunteers. You can't see it here but the audience was pretty small and so I do think it was a missed opportunity! @andrewyang2020
#####
Putting the humanity back in the democratic party. A laudable goal.

Good luck to you.
#####
I converted a friend of mine who is a Clump supporter to Mr. Yang in 2020. God damn it feels good.
#####
Andrew I was really getting involved with what you had going on. Until I saw how  you viewed Gun Safety on your main campaign site.

If you could see this just like you visit truckers, another thing you should do is try to own a firearm and educate yourself with them.
looking at what your proposing I can tell your very ignorant on the matter.

I wish you the best, and I hope I open you up looking into this matter more.
#####
I am not an american citizen, but if i was i would vote for you in a heartbeat. I saw your podcast with Joe Rogan, i work in AI and it's refreshing to see someone that understands that the world is gonna be a completely different place in 10 years and we need to start changing the way society is structured right now before it's too late. I hope you have a good run and people realize this is an issue even if you don't win. Good luck!

I never thought id see the day when real people run and get elected to our nations highest posts.

Chinese American here, seeing all the hatred against China and Chinese and other minority groups in USA I'm about to give up on this Cuntry. I wonder if Mr Yang can really bring about change. I'm not really that hopeful.

We can provide heathcare to everyone: we can train and staff our hospitals with a non-combatant Health Corps akin to Coast Guard; we could grow it out of the Navy Medical Service Corps and make it a new branch like we did with the Air Force out of the Army. It is as important as a Space Force, if not moreso.

Andrew, I'll be voting for either you or Tulsi Gabbard. The two of you are the only candidates worth voting for in 2020. I'm sure some of the others are nice people but I will not vote for them. I'll instead vote for The Green Party. But, if Kamala Harris the DNC's pick is the Democrat nominee in 2020 I will not vote Green Party I will instead vote for Trump. And, I don't want Trump to win in 2020 but more than anything I hate a cheat, I hate favorites, and I hate being offered a choice between one a pile of crap or another pile of crap. No more Neo-Liberal Democrats. What I would like to see is a Yang/Gabbard or a Gabbard/Yang win in 2020. #Yang2020 or #Tulsi2020. The rest can go pound sand.

#####
I have no friends who can contribute money if I get sick, which is why I have a suicide plan, should it be needed. That plan should not exist in the mind of anyone who lives in "the greatest country in the world."
#####
It just makes sense. It took me a while to see the whole picture, once upon a time I was a republican. Then trump happened. I couldn't un-see what had been seen. I have come a full 180 in realizing how much I had been lied to about the numbers by conservative minds. People who simply don't grasp the reality, and severity of the situation. I was aspiring to be "wealthy" but the price was more than I was willing to pay. My humanity. Universal basic income, a heavy estate tax, and a VAT tax are a good start to get back what's been stolen from the people. It is however, only a start. I'm paying attention to Andrey Yang. I need to know more before I can throw my support behind him, but I'll say the same about anyone else at this point too.
#####
Great clip!
#####
The sad violin was a little cliche, but Yang 2020.

If we want to fix this Country and get this Country out of debt, we have to 1) Get our tech companies to stop evading corporate income tax, and instead tack a value added tax on all the operational transactions up the value chain 2) Stop forcing all our businesses to carry the burden of managing a massive internal bureaucracy of (ineffectively) managing employee healthcare 3) Foster more efficient allocation of human capital by detaching healthcare from employment so that there is greater freedom of movement towards more efficient job placements in the market 4) Stop paying the massive costs of dysfunction-- when huge portions of the population are unable to afford a sudden 500 dollar expense, are cutting meds, and relying on expensive ER care as primary care and taxpayers paying massive unnecessary bills 5) Begin an entrepreneurial revolution by giving people universal healthcare and putting cash in their pockets. The resources that will allow a greater portion of the population with the right talents to throw up a middle finger at their employers and start new successful enterprises. If I were in charge, we would make UBI $1000 per month which will simultaneously stimulate new small business. In short, we want to super charge the markets by making high quality universal single payer healthcare, implementing a universal basic income, and getting money out of politics in order to get rid of anti-competitive regulations that benefit big monopolies. WHILE ALSO going for greater consumer protections to end this Opioid crisis and get human health on track for greater productivity. You know whose platform looks like this the most? Andrew Yang's.

$1,000 a month for me is an instant dream come true.  #1, A new car payment ( A better car allowed me to travel further for works or taking a vacation). #2, monthly car insurance (required by law, can't drive without it). #3, monthly phone and internet bills (stay connect with friends and family). #4, monthly utility bill (I don't want to worry about living without it ). All these major expenses will be GUARANTEED under the UBI program, gives me LESS STRESS. My monthly salary will cover my rent, food, entertainments and the rest will go to saving for buying a house someday or invest for early retirement. UBI also help stronger my communities, for example; Car dealerships will sell more cars. Restaurants will have more customer, etc. Most importantly, fewer street crimes and fewer homeless people - people will feel motivated to stay out of jail because now they have something to "live for" and "live with" under the UBI program. I am making around $2000 a month salary after tax plus UBI =¬† a 50% pay raise. Life is good for" ALL"  under the UBI system.

A politician that actually makes me optimistic about our future? And teaches me stuff with every interview? I thought these were oxymoronic  until I discovered Andrew Yang. This is my man. (Consider this: Bernie will be 82 in his fourth year of presidency if elected; cry,, this is just too old in a fast changing environment.)
#####
I notice the only people who oppose yang are quite uninformed when it comes to our economy and the flaws that allow manipulation by those with power
#####
He has something like 2% name recognition and polling at 3%. Basically, everyone who hears Yang speak wants him to be president.

He's not a socialist.
He's a Marxist-Leninist.

YANGGANG
#####
That $1000, a month,  people will just buy from Amazon with that money! So Amazon will just suck that money.
#####
Corrupt voting system will kept this guy out of the Whitehouse, big business runs things in this town.  I'd vote for him, sadly I don't believe any voting system is trust worthy in this broken system.  Blockchain voting needs to be implemented
#####
Seems asians are also better at being president
#####
What if people just spend the 12K buying more stuff on Amazon?
#####
I have behind the scenes in New Hampshire.
#####
I don't understand how he can introduce a Freedom Dividend and not elaborate more on the issue of illegal immigration or tax payer preference or any criteria relative to this obviously huge financial comittment.  Its great if we just decide that money in of itself has no intrinsic human value.That time and productivity are essentially separate from the human factor,but does being a country with an identity and fixed economic values mean abandoning those values for an open border, open society doctrine that relinquishes any rights or preferences to protect itself from foreign infiltration and economic imposition.

HOW YANG CAN SAVE AMERICA?

Andrew Yang has to pull America out its viscious cycle that started from day one. The following elements have put America on a road of no return: 

* A godly figure, Jesus Christ, is used as a justification for the eternal mopping up of nonbelievers. 

* An exploitative spirit that requires constant strengthened by military buildup and sustained by endless supplies of victims.  

* A fixation on language skills for its theatrical merits, reaching such an extreme extend that made language a weapon for conquest of the minds rather than the tool of communication as it should be.

The rescue of America is a tall order.  And Andy is just a little Chinaman.  However, today even the littler Chinamen backhome have now become giants.  China is powerful enough to destroy Amreica, risking doomsday, or save it through Andy.

Peace is as difficult as war is easy.  This is what Andy can do for peace:

Overcoming the overwhelming language skills of the best talkers in America and get the following messages through to the voters to get himself elected and to gain the power necessary to accomplish the following tasks:

* Getting America to pull all its troops out of other countries.

* All the rest of the world, leading by China, will foot the bill for all the expenses involved, including reimbursing for the costs of construction of the weapons, which should be turned into peaceful uses by whoever put up the money, and pay up other expenses relate to this peace effort, all toward the goal of forgiving America's national debts, which otherwise is fast turning into the greatest cause for WWIII.

This suits humanity just right, because those debts were the exact expenses spent on building the capability to destroy the world.

* Sharing all intellectual properties and centralize them on a hub of 5G, supercomputing, software automation network to automate the world, without abandoning and enslaving the working mass, this time.

Granted, the above proposal is hard to swallow, but it is doable. And our mad Andy has already taken the first hard step.

Andrew Yang listens to the people
#####
If this guy doesn't become president, might as well just burn the constitution and dismantle congress because then it's clearly not working for the American people.
#####
Yang first. If the DNC screws him over, it's all aboard the Trump train again.
#####
Lmao the ad for this video was about a software to automate essay writing
#####
https://www.change.org/p/cnn-get-andrew-yang-a-cnn-presidential-town-hall
#####
I feel like this candidate will change the way america works for the better. I really think he'll be able to empower the "99 %" or whatever you wanna call the majority of the american, working class
 people.
#####
Start my capitalism journey with $1000 capital. Yes.
#####
dude is dope tho, im a fan so far.  hopefully he ll be able to handle to bureaucracy.
#####
wouldn't a large % of that 1000 go right back to amazon? lol ...
#####
Well atleast Yang understands the democrats are stupid in not giving Trump a trivial 5 billion, and you need a strong border. Annnd then he rambles on about how trump sucks with a 60 year low unemployment rate. . . still sounds more sane than most democrats.
#####
Future focused!
#####
"We are going to build a $1000 a month sack for EVERYONE and make Zuckerberg and Bezos pay for it" BOOOOOM #YAGA2020
#####
It would help a lot homeless people get better and be able to move to where rent are cheaper.  The homeless are growing in this country. It's insane.
#####
If he can't win the nomination for 2020, i think he has a very real chance in 2024. I really want him ASAP though. The sooner we address the problems of the future, the better.
#####
Officially  #Yanggang 2020 this would help so many people, including people who wants to open their own business
#####
If you're a Democrat, you want to get behind this guy.  He's your only hope for beating Trump in 2020
#####
Taxing on the big tech giants? He will make a lot of enemies
#####
He got the hooks definitely
#####
Don't forget warehouse jobs, longshoresman jobs, firefighting jobs, security jobs,  law jobs, adminstrative jobs, medical jobs, entry level art jobs, entry level programming jobs, pharmacist jobs, etc. etc.
#####
I haven‚Äôt read any negative criticism of this guy. I‚Äôm sold! Let‚Äôs get this guy into office!
#####
UBI has no flaws ($1000 is only enough pay for some bills, so it wont cause ANY raise of ANY price, BUT it helps ease the pain that all Americans face which is lack of "that money" that can just help little bit more)
#####
Trumps quotes Fox&Friends, Yang quotes Hawking.
#####
Who cares about Yang. Free ice cream for everyone if you vote for Trump.
#####
Asian guys and there numbers! I'm def backing this dude!
#####
Wow, a democrat with reasonable answers and realistic, possible solutions!! Imagine that?! Non-emotional but a straight shooter!!
#####
The only thing I don't like about that he is not consistent on how it will be paid. First, the cost amount seems to change from 1.8 - 3 trillion dollars from one interview to the other. Next, the value added tax he just talked about would bring in less than half of the cost. The other money would come from other savings and more taxable income. He explains it better in some interviews. Point is, he is always inconsistent about that question. Perhaps he doesn't thing the details are important for the campaign.
#####
I would love to see him as Bernie's VP. Would also love to see Yang talk more about the corrupt, rigged system, corporate welfare and campaign finance reform.
#####
Problem solvers are the back bone of America! 
Hang isn't fighting left or right.
Yang is fixing problems everyone life's with.
#MakeAmericaBetter #Yang2020
#####
Yang gang 2020!! Can't wait for that thousand bucks.
#####
this is a guise for socialism and paving the way for AI
#####
Vote Andrew Yang 2020 and "Turn the clocks forward". Our Nation is politically stagnant.
#####
The mall in Topeka Kansas where my family live is a great example, it will be interesting to see if he can revive them back.
#####
I like what he has to say i may be missing something though when he talks about malls closing and automation taking jobs from people yet he says that giving people free momey creates jobs I guess i need a little more explanation on how that happens
#####
Yang is great. He's got my vote.
#####
It isn't just Americans that are optimistic about a US leader that proposes relevant solutions, solutions that ensure the best of our science and technology is used for human concern. If Americans don't vote him into power, we in Australia have a vacuum of substantive leadership that this guy would easily fill.
#####
Seems like this guy uses his scientific point of view to influence his policies and try to create a better future for our species. I think he is too far in the future and too smart to become the president... at this moment that is. I think our best bet is Bernie, he has the popularity and he can show people that progressive policies are the way to a better future, making Andrew seem more appetizing to the general public and a wet dream to those that care for the future of our species.
#####
This guy is dangerous, just another libtard who talks smart and wants universal healthcare, universal income, and gun licenses so they can eventually confiscate them, no thank you.
#####
This guy talks smart until he gets to the border, every border control agent, and investigative report shows that the wall saves lives and reduces the number of illegal crossings. His comment is flagrant and irresponsible on this topic. The wall is needed in certain areas where it makes sense plain and simple. He further lies about democrats wanting a secure border, that‚Äôs not true at all, they have stated many times they want open borders. The wall is not a symbol, it‚Äôs a much needed tool in the toolbox used to secure the border, from walls to rivers to drones and patrols.
#####
Or we could make policies that prohibit or regulate the amount of automation that a company can use in a given business; not make people dependent on gov't money to live a poor life and secure votes for a given party based on how much free money they get. Universal income is an idea whos end outcome is slavery!! The worst is when a person who pretends they are smart but the consequences of their ideas fall very short into absolute failure and doesnt actually address anything in a logical way!!
This guy has failed.
#####
I would like to give the journalist some credit, nice seeing such an objective level headed conversation in the media. Also, Mr. Yang has great potential #reasonwillprevail .
#####
I say his goofy laugh will be his downfall.
#####
The only problem I see with people receiving extra free money each month is that, at some point, they will demand more. Most people have a hard time understanding their spending. For example, they manage to live on $1000/month with a $2000 salary, but if they get a bonus or pay rise to $2500, their spending will also rise and they're again in the same situation. All I'm concerned about is the way they will spend this money is on stuff that they don't need and won't help their local communities.
#####
Boom
#####
The first complaint I hear about Universal Basic Income(UBI) is that they don't want people who aren't working to get the same amount of money that they do, but they fail to think that they themselves might not be able to get a job in the future. 
I don't really know if a value added tax is necessarily the best way to pay for a UBI, but there are a TON of ways to pay for it reasonably easily.
#####
Yang vs Bernie
#####
the gig economy is exactly what capitalists want, no secure jobs, no safety nets, (no unions or welfare) the means of production is still in the private hands of a small few corporations.  etc.
#####
Fair game? A big advantage for Andrew Yang!!
#####
He has no Chance at all!
#####
UBI completely preserves our capitalistic potential, provides security to everyone, decreases government bloat, and increases personal autonomy.
It's not charity or a handout, but a dividend from our hard-earned stake in this country.
The more I think about it, the better it gets.
#####
"you can't have Socialism and 
Capitalism work together." You do. They don't exist mutually exclusively. Compound interest happened as much in the Soviet Union as it did does in America. You can't escape economics. All successful governments in world history have had a capitalist economy with intelligent socialist programmes to mitigate undesired outcomes. That is how America got to become the richest nation on earth.
#####
His running to improve the lives of the working people. what about the unemployed?
#####
Yang is a failure don't be misled 
His 3 companies that failed:
Stargiver - outright failure
Venture for America - outright failure failing to meet even 4% of objectives 
Manhattan prep - sold before recession to avoid impending failure

That's the summary of experience this joker who wants to be POTUS has
#####
The sad thing is that because Fox News is seen as a wing of the Republican Party by many Democrats, no one who can vote for Yang as the Dem candidate will ever see this. 

Thanks two party system.
#####
This man is a Socalist and too far too many people can't see that. America doesn't need socalism .  Socalism doesn't work. If you agree with Yang you're an idiot.
#####
I'm conservative and I like this dude.
#####
This guy said and repeated how he "road around in a little guys truck" like he's flying around flying cars
#####
old mate needs to clear that throat
#####
Zionists are destroying our reality.

Sick bastards
#####
Only one problem with his comments: he does not know what he is talking about.  Capitalism is private ownership and control.  Socialism is government ownership and control.  Capitalism works.  Socialism doesn't.  He should know this as a successful capitalist.  Sadly it is clear he either doesn't or figures saying this nonsense will help him politically...
#####
"My friend" proceeds to mispronounce his name.
#####
We all know that he is right. It's an old understanding. There's new information.There is AT LEAST enough production to provide dignified living conditions for EVERYONE and our production capability was serially-generated by ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS over millions of years and that the planet and the advances of human ingenuity are the heritage of every being on this planet, and it is the thinker's responsibility to advance the whole planet, and in our lifetimes, the solar system.
#####
I'm still going for Trump, but may vote for yang in 2024 if republicans don't have someone better like Candice Owens.
#####
How is he even able run...the law is specific...you need to be a 3rd generation american...he is an immigrant..not even his grandkids are allowed to be president
#####
How come Donald Drumph has never said, "I am the son of an immigrant."This is on his mom's side. How come he has not  said, "I am the grandson of immigrants." This would be his dad's German side. Yang, I guess, has no choice to be honest because of his East Asian phenotype. What would TR think?
#####
yang is playing a great game, by not criticizing trump. As a result, he would be able to come onto FOX, while being avoided by cnn and msnbc, because he is unwilling to comdemn trump. This allows him to garner support from not only asian democrats, but trump supporters, moderates, and democrats that can relate to the problems that he is addressing.
#####
I have learned Republican for years. Not that Ibam a Republican. I am an American!! This guy can win this thing. He either gets it or he is putting on a big show and lying. The Democratic partywill not stand for this if he is real. They will start targeting him. I wish you well sir. I hope you make it to the final show down against Trump. I will have a hard choice to make at that point!!! But it would be a welcome change to have a real choice!!!!!
#####
He should get elected to congress first 
Crazy Asian thinks a few stolen theories can get him the WH üòÇ
Stop embarassing Dems and quit we don't want you
#####
it can be both dude, its called perfection, sort of like balancing the masculine and feminine
#####
If he'd eventually lose, God forbid, it's just because he's Asian.
#####
This guy is so far out of reach with reality
#####
Andrew Yang makes so much sense. He is absolutely brilliant. And, very humane too. 
 The Country needs this man.
#####
He looks so much younger 10 Months ago lol
#####
Yang cured my racism.
#####
UBI is about giving people FREEDOM OF CHOICE, FREEDOM TO CHOOSE! I will take it anytime hands down! The money will go back into the communities as the bulk of it will be spent there. It will keep business going and with the extra $ I can start my own business. With automation, companies in the 21st century will hire less people. Amazon is a good example. THERE WILL BE LESS JOBS and MORE JOB LOSSES TO COME SOONER THAN YOU THINK!!! So please wake up and look around! America is going to need more businesses n startups if it is going to survive and compete in the 21st century n beyond. For those who aren't able to work or compete for the 21st century jobs, its a crutch u can stand on. That is why Andrew is in the race for President! NO CITIZEN of America should have to starve to be a human being or live without a decent shelter in AMERICA OF ALL COUNTRIES! So Vote for Yang!!
#####
This guy makes every other candidate look like lopp-sided down syndrome 16 year olds.
#####
I'm from the UK, so i can't vote for Andrew yang or donate to him. I wish we had our own version of Andrew Yang.
#####
Wether you agree with his solutions to modern problems or not. He obviously really cares about everyone including white people. And his proposed solutions are real and affordable if you just look up him explaining it. Who knows if it would work. But hey, it‚Äôs worth a try.
#####
Don't down Andrew because he is asian look at Andrew for who and what he is .  Mr Yang is an American and has a family that he is taking care of here in America .  With Andrew Yang is not a matter of money either .  It is a matter of his family and his country and he wants to see a better tomarow for all of us .                      üòä                     gb*          ~           hard life              (MULDEW)             Mr Andrew Yang for President in 2020
#####
Many first time Trump voters are disappointed that Trump never stepped up and became more "Presidential"  Instead he has continually chosen to go low and petty... and in the process has severely eroded the tradition of "civil discourse" between Americans who (used to be able to) honestly disagree.

I thank my mother for teaching me how to distinguish right from wrong. At this point I can only assume that people who still defend this man cannot.
#####
He is just what we need. Bipartisan bridging towards a quick moving future. We are here today to create and play, but leave a better world, together. Thank you Fox for being so open and respectful.

Automation problem and job losses are real. Tv host and hostess jobs are replaceable too. These are high paid jobs and the networks are eager to find ways to replace them. It is coming, maybe not in 2 years, how about 10 years? Ubi just one policy to stave  off job losses . If someone has better policy, it will be great but so far there is no better option than ubi.

#####
People voted for Trump because he didn‚Äôt sound like a politician. The problem is Trump never had any answers to the questions thrown at him, and only selected softball interviewers to answer questions.

Andrew Yang doesn‚Äôt talk like a politician either, but unlike anyone else, the man doesn‚Äôt even falter when asked difficult questions. You don‚Äôt even hear him doing that ol politician bs ‚Äúwell this is a very big problem‚Äù before answering questions: he just goes straight for it

Attention world i figured it all outüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î red dirt poor okie here in Oklahoma USA. Heres my solution to America's economy, min wage should be simple math; Cost of living for that area duh not national. Companies and businesses should be required to show on pay stubs/checks how much money you earned them. agian simple math, as you make them money youll make more money. Back bone of capitalism. Just pay us what were worth... medical insurance should not exist, its one of thousands of money black holes. Moving money from every one to just a few. State and city taxes should make hospitals affordable( $15 check up). Govorment should be here for its Internationale role. Not to regulate the people. State and city should regulate the people. Prisoners should be producing. Contributing to the state. We should ALL be donating to make our state the best state in America. Everyone should pay one simple state tax (based on what you earn) state pays goverment % of what citizens paid. Nov 1st oklahoma passes constitutional carry. Everyone over 21 witout a felony can openly carry. This is great. For our country!!üòÅ Nothing will change here, theres open carry permit almost anyone can get with a lil $. Upstanding citizens carry everywhere. Lastly we love trumpü§ò trump train!!. We have a great country here, lets not ruin it!

Trump 2020. Yang 2024
#####
Way to go, Andrew Yang! Great philosophy and solutions, visions and courage!!
#####
YANG 2020
#####
Few questions, what‚Äôs going to happen with illegal immigrants that are going to come for this $1000 a month. Is the govt going to give them billions in handouts like the dems currently are? 
Also, he states that‚Äôs his tax base to fund the $1k per month will be coming from companies. Why would companies stay here if they‚Äôre going to be taxed like crazy then? Also, how would you fund that program if the overall economy enters a recession and the tax base isn‚Äôt where it needs to be from a tax income perspective? By printing more money, inflation?? What would happen to purchasing value of the dollar, considering housing prices, car prices, etc. will skyrocket due to the extra income and investment potential for them. I personally would buy a house with my extra $1k per month and rent it out for $1500. Now if everyone else starts doing this, then what did we really solve. Nothing....I would like to hear more than the cover story and I feel like Americans never look into the repercussions.....
#####
I predict yang will be killed in an car accident in the next nine months .
#####
Libertarians for Yang!!!
#####
Totally agree...I see it the same way.
We are living in a so dated system..it doesn't work for us anymore. The world is changing..we are not follow the change to make the difference.
#####
yang / sanders 2020!
#####
I think i'm gonna vote for yang. I only voted for Trump because i didn't want hillary.
#####
A mixed economy is the worst kind of economy because it pleases nobody.  You'll still have capitalism at the top and socialism and poverty all the way down towards the bottom.
#####
If socialized healthcare really is cheaper, why don't we socialize everything? Socialize: food, housing transportation, etc.
#####
Homeless in America is growing. It is affecting many business. Andrew's freedom dividend would help our economy.

#####
Why can't we be "both", capitalist AND socialist? Cavuto is thinking myopically.
#####
His solution to job loss is to increase the debt  cause more inflation by giving out free money?
#####
no it is not.
#####
I really like Yang. I just hope the corporations don‚Äôt pass on the value added tax to us consumers. I also worry about inflation.
#####
You Yang nuts should understand that he has promised to raise taxes on EVERYONE. His goofy plans cannot be paid for by jus soaking the rich ...smarten up and vote for Warren she is the only one who can beat Trump!
#####
Free money, Yaaa! 
What could go wrong?
#####
There has to be more people pulling the wagon than those sitting in it.
#####
Brilliant Andrew Yang!
#####
Yang is win win situation
#####
Hmong pride ü•∞üíïüíï
#####
I didn‚Äôt even know someone in politics like him even existed...
#####
If Yang doesn't win, I'm moving to China to teach English before everyone decides to do the same after losing their job to a robot.



Just kidding. I'm too broke to even buy a plane ticket. Looks like I'll just have to cut my food budget by eating crackers and hot sauce. üò•üò≠ü§ß Also, I work six days a week and only earn $700 a week as a quality control inspector with an engineering degree. Because of that, I supplement my income by driving for Lyft and investing in the stock market. Eventually I'll have enough to just live off of dividens and swing trading. Once that happens, I will focus in other business ventures in the It industry because the Engineering profession is non-existing. Most so call engineering jobs don't require any real engineering skills and those that do are a few.
#####
Yang Gang. He isn't a leftist or right wing
#####
This man has ideas. Which makes him dangerous. He will never make it in Washington D.C. Yang for 2020.
#####
Andrew yang for president!üá∫üá∏
#####
4:38 Brain fail
#####
Support Yang!!
#####
Evolutionary thinking in the area of economic and political reality is a refreshing alternative to the tired old platitudes that mean nothing.
#####
Actually, he‚Äôs not saying anything new or novel. For example, you can get much of his economic plan from Peter Joseph and the Zeitgeist movement. 
As for economic displacement, Marx said as much in Das Kapital; that the capitalist drive to lower wages will lead to technological innovation and thus displacement of workers. It‚Äôs the rationale behind supply side policies  regarding investment and tax policies. 
The reason he‚Äôs liked by both parties is because he‚Äôs not threatening the status quo of Capitalism, even though it‚Äôs at the root of the problem.
#####
Wait so is yang a dem or rep
#####
It's not LEFT or RIGHT it has to be FORWARD in AMERICA!!!!
#####
Yang said, "I'm running to keep country strong for my children." That's the most ridiculous statement ever by a presidential candidate. Yang's "keep country strong" is¬†just a copycat of¬†Trump's 2020 campaign slogan¬†of "Keep America Great". Also, Yang's "for my children" is totally divisive. Yang was¬†born into a wealthy family, so were¬†his children¬†because Yang himself is a millionaire, according to Newsweek. What happens to those children who are less fortunate? Yang certainly doesn't stand up for them. In short, Yang takes sides of the elite and their children while ignoring¬†American middle and working class men and women, and their children.

Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are the only two democrats candidates that FOX has not attacked.  They talk sense to both liberals and conservatives.  FOX respect Andrew because he cars for America
#####
Andrew yang is a president for all. Yang gang all the way not right not left but Str8 forward!
#####
Wow...Andrew nail it every time. Very intelligent guy!
#####
CNN and MSNBC {MSLSD} are totally out of touch.    They need to support the Yang Gang.
#####
I wish all all interactions between media and candidate, republican and democrat, could be this civil and progress-oriented. Well done Fox Business and Andrew Yang!
#####
Who is a Yangster?
#####
Trump is not attacking him on Twitter and is attacking everyone else...wonder why?
#####
Everyone here says dont mention trump. Honestly you guys are kinda idiots if you believe that he should go the entire campaign without saying a single fucking thing. It not possible because the dude is who he'd be running against. He has to make others see why trump shouldnt have their vote. Not to mention this video is funny.
#####
I will vote either Trump or Yang
#####
Lol
#####
Lolll
#####
Haha
#####
That's hilarious. But also... Oh, god.
#####
Trump, your¬†next job is¬†stand-up stupid narcissistic comedian; you are naturally very good at it!¬† Pitiful, is the saddest word to describe any person, it's a shame I can't even apply it to Trump-the-in-human-thing!¬† Republican4Yang!
#####
To comments displeased by Yang's chuckle:¬† I like the satirical note in the video--there were only two words from Andrew, "Oh god."¬† These two perfectly natural placed words is the reason¬†Andrew is running for President!¬†¬†Trump is the focus; Trump is the reason¬†for Yang2020--allow¬†AY to poignantly express his feelings and let off some steam--Andrew earned it!¬† Andrew will never be a bully--there is a difference between acknowledging the bona fide lunatic-bully Trump who thinks himself a "genius" versus Andrew chuckling at¬†Trump's lunacy.¬† Let¬†Andrew be!¬† That's why you like him because he is honest and natural--let him express his honest humanism; let him blow off steam.¬† If Andrew starts treating Trump with the respect that Trump does not¬†deserve or give to anyone else--then we are a part of the Silent Ones¬†(GOPs), what's the point!¬† Do not box Andrew in--Andrew is not the sort of soul¬†that¬†could go¬†the Trump cesspool route--NEVER!¬†¬†Let the chuckles¬†fly!

It's just a small jab hes not basing it on hating trump from what I can see

Is this the man who challenge a old man to a pushups contest? 

What a piece of shit.  How about I challenging you to any lifting contesting of your choice?  I'm 39 so age wise we are closer. 

For those who say that I am a Trump supporter I just want to point out i am not from the US.  Just think this Andrew Yang is a faggot who only challenge weaker person. 
What a piece of shit
#####
I agree with most. Stick to your policies, they are so good. But to each their own.

I FINALLY FOUND IT!!!! THE GIF!!!

If you want to win then you need to cut the shit and focus on your own messages. Stop passive aggressively attacking Donald Trump, it's just making you look bad.
#####
Trump is right in identifying some of the problems this country is facing, but Yang has the better solution.
#####
If you put humanity first you would abolish capitalism.

stick to being the problem solver and to the facts keep it real  let everybody bash and  trash talk  each other to death until only one remains there can be only one thats Yang stay righteous and don't get corrupted And you will be blessed from above miracles do happen

So excited Yang has a CNN Town Hall April 14th. Yang 2020.
#####
why do people consider this an attack on donald trump??? what if he is just challenging trump on who know about technology and its impacts and how to use it for good of people. people just so scared of trump for what??? even if it was an attack i think its good. stop being such pussies i say
#####
I'm a trump supporter and I like you. I didn't take this message as an offense , but I imagine it can effect a lot of trump voters to not vote for you. You're doing a great job turning trump supporters to your supporter so try not to attack trump. I would say get Trump to be on your side.
#####
HAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS GOLD
#####
I pledge allegiance to the bag.
#####
Trump is a total baffoon. We all know this. Stick to your message, though. That's your real selling point and will differentiate you from all the other candidates. Also... consider pete buttigieg as your runningmate.
#####
Really the greatest, most knowledgeable person to talk to about technology he knows it all, he is probably, the most technologist person you'll ever meet, believe me, I know technology and this guy is the best at it

That moment when technology Livestreams your lawyers testimony as he fucks you over and shows the hush money checks that he paid. 


Did he mean that technology?
#####
This is hilarious.
#####
If you support Trump, be honest with yourself: Him saying that nobody knows more about technology than him... you gotta admit that's completely absurd and pretty chuckle-worthy. This is only showing that Yang is human and acknowledges the absurdity of things that Trump says
#####
Jesis Christ, people are going to whine that now you're making fun of Trump. I say you should rag on him hardcore and prove that he knows nothing about it. And if you ever debated him, to expose that he knows literally nothing about technology. 

But sadly, in order to get the stupid republicans to vote for you, you can't bash him or they'll get all defensive and whiny
#####
Weird to see people saying not to go after trump. I feel the opposite. Trump is ridiculous and it's important to point out how ridiculous he is. Too many people still think the wall is a good idea.
#####
I know its tempting but laying off Trump probably is a good idea, we need those rural votes
#####
Everyone, Yang have a crazy sense of humor. His joke, ‚Äúwhy is China more advanced in technology than the US? They‚Äôre 12 hours ahead of us...‚Äù

Loved this video
To those that are crying about this being an attack on trump and it hurts Donald Trump supports please explain how he can openly say all the shit he does about everyone and even admit to sexual harassment but one little joke about him knowing technology is off limits
I think this a great video more on Andrew being just like the rest of us when listening to trump then actually about trump 
Beside didn't you see the nice picture of trump that was used which was very nice to trump
#####
Hi Andrew, please don't make Trump a part of your message.  I think your strength is your calm, rational approach to your policies.  Talking about Trump is exactly what people don't want to hear.
#####
YANG 2020
#####
go to as much interviews as you can & expose yourself to the country. You have a chance
#####
Don‚Äôt go after trump he will absolutely destroy you, just focus on your own campaign.
#####
This is awesome. I have seen many many Yang speeches and interviews and this is the part of him which sets him apart. He is just so.... real! Natural, human, relatable. Besides a kind genius : D

Andrew you appeal to MANY conservatives dont go the leftist hate way

You've captured attention because of your good and most importantly, CALM AND OBJECTIVE nature. You can show through knowledge and logic that your know what's right. Please don't attack other politicians just because, you're better than them!

I'd almost suggest removing the video
#####
Andrew, please be careful NOT to bash Trump. He's got a lot of supporters who like your ideas, judging by comments to some YouTube videos of you -- so you gotta stick to economics and stay away from Trump-bashing and identity politics!! It'll be tricky, of course, to signal strong disagreement with Trump without making his supporters feel attacked...but you must not simply bash or mock the guy or you risk coming off as Al Gore did WRT "W."

Do not underestimate what donald knows about technology. I am sure that Trump being 71 years old has seen it all when it comes to technology in the construction industry. Of course when it concerns about A.I. i am sure mr Andrew Yang, who i very much appreciate as well, knows a lot more.
#####
I already know what Donald Trump thinks ... so this doesn't tell me anything about Andrew Yang.
#####
I like you Andrew and I like Donald Trump, don't make fun of him or Trump voters, Focus on why your platform and policies are better.

Every sane persons reaction to donald trump.

Finally Someone that can laugh in his face ... Trump is about the dumbest trash talker ever....."mr I cant get No pussy so I have to splurge" himself lol......someone that can call him on his Bullshit n explain to everyone why its Bullshit....trump lies 90% of the time and the people in front of him can't combat it because they be lying too......yang has not this problem......
#####
Andrew, we need a complete compilation clip of all the stuff "Nobody knows..........................better than me." 
We do.
#####
I was all for yang until I read deeper into his policies on how UBI is funded. He makes his speeches asking the American people how we ALL over the age of 18 would like a EXTRA 1k in our pockets right? Well not so fucking fast! The only people that benefit from UBI is workers and rich people as none of them get restrictions to UBI. They will get 1k a month no restrictions or deductions to their UBI. A billionaire or millionaire and someone working minimum wage at Micky Dees will get the full 1k a month UBI without deduction or restriction. But here‚Äôs the slap in millions of other Americans faces that draw social security disability a month and receiving welfare such as tanf for their kids and food stamps. Those people will be made to have to make a choice to keep their disability and welfare help and not get UBI at all or give up their disability and welfare help and only get the UBI of 1k a month. If they give up welfare and decide to keep Social Security they will reduce the UBI and adjust it meaning reducing your UBI money income. That is such BULLSHIT! Capitalism striking its ugly face again by screwing over the poor and spoiling the well off and rich. Its bad enough the poor on welfare and disability can‚Äôt claim their kids on income tax at all and get no help there like workers do and usually workers get back more in a tax refund claiming kids than they paid in all year. Meaning they didn‚Äôt even pay taxes when they get REFUNDED and extra on top of it. How else does workers always have newer cars and always driving around with new temp tags around tax time right? Yet the disabled are made to suffer and get no income tax to help with buying cars, they are left to deal with cheap breaking down beaters half running and smoking down the road as its all they can afford since being disabled and on poor welfare gets punished unlike a worker that can work. UBI spoils workers and rich people giving them no restrictions what so ever when it comes to UBI. That is bull! A billionaire that don‚Äôt even need it will get its full benefits but a poor disabled and poor welfare person gets restrictions and can‚Äôt get both. That isn‚Äôt extra to them, that is treating them different and isn‚Äôt right. Capitalism at its finest as always. Andrews UBI is bullshit to disabled and poor welfare people. It screws them over and spoils everyone else! 

Also, to anyone that turns 18 in 2021 and if Andrew makes it President in 2020 to implement UBI in Jan 2021 and you dropped out of school and didn‚Äôt graduate, you can‚Äôt get UBI until your 20 years old. That is also in his policy of UBI.
#####
I had the same reaction to  Yangs $12000 per person give away.  That's all he's got. I wonder if everyone in Honduras and Guatemala also get $12000 per year. Like that would be like a major boom to like our  like economy.  The  old orange tin foil hat wearing  buffoon  knows what he's doing.  Trump 2020. Socialism after I die  please.
#####
Hhaaha
#####
Trump is an old fart.   Like his voters.  They're waiting for the jobs to come back from China.   They wanna work in the factory.  Rubes....I love flying over them.  And of course....there will be no wall.  Yawn.   You're almost done.
#####
Don't make your campaign about Trump. Focus on your message instead.
#####
"lolololol... Oh god..." -Andrew Yang...and everyone else, 2019
#####
Yangs plan puts the government first.

Not humanity.

Only individuals can decide what is best for themselves.  

Yang wants to reduce individuals down to a collective.  He is an " all problems fit one solution" kind of guy.  

Yang is a true socialist and like all socialists he seeks greater government control over the lives of individuals.

If he is elected president he will not be satisfied with simply controlling how Americans make their living.
#####
Humanity first? Funny, if u can ruin White House or build a Yellow House and a Black House
#####
Serious question. We have a LOT of people running for President against Trump. Unfortunately, we have people like Beto making videos of getting his teeth worked on, Elizabeth drinking beer, Julian being Mexican (white conservatives automatically hate him).... is this going to ensure Trump wins? Let's face it. His cult will vote for him no matter what. If the DNC is divided, Trump wins.
#####
Please yang hold a rally in Dallas we want to see you here .
#####
That "oh God" lmao.

Don't start your campaign with insulting my president

#####
In all honesty i love our military and everything but if we stoped putting billions and billions of dollers into our military fund Ubi would seem like a more logical choice to all the people that oppos. Of it
#####
Andrew Yang is the real deal. At first he intrigued me because he explained difficult topics so easily and matter of factedly. Andrew Yang is a strong leader, intelligent, eloquent and has experience, solutions and vision to bring America into a brighter future. Facing this 4th industrial revolution that will affect huge populations of Americans in unprecented proportions, we need to think long and hard and demand structural change for the citizens of the world's most wealthiest country. 
Human value does not equal economic value.  This is such a strong statement, that us Americans have often forgotten. Our value is not tied into our work. The people who have to make the hard decisions to forego pay and provide care to children, the future of our country, or family members, or choose to spend their time in other meaningful ways that give back to society have immense value to society. The freedom divident is like a tax credit, put into the hands of the people so we may choose where we put our money. Not in giant corporations who store their money offshore, giving little back to our communities.
The GDP and unemployement rate (only includes those seeking employment) or archaic and not reflective of the well being of our country. Our labor participation rate is at record lows. Only 63% of our adults are in the labor force or actively seeking work. We know that our death rate is at record high since the Spanish flu, which is terrifying. We need to start using metrics of our country to reflect what is important to us. We do not know what we do not measure. 
Andrew Yang has my support. He maybe a nontraditional politician, but he is undoubtedly committed to solving America's problems. Lets exercise our right to vote, vote on the right candidate, not on whom we predict will win. 
Andrew Yang has supporters across the aisle and I am truly hopeful that America can do better.
#####
Good that Andrew Yang wants to put MLK‚Äôs guaranteed income idea into action for the seek of the well-being of every family in the United States!
#####
ya know. put the advertisements for yang not over the subtitles. I came here to see MLK on UBI, not ads for yang. I'm yang gang but I don't like the look of this.
#####
MLK supports Andrew Yang
#####
this is a deep fake--look closely at his jaw and notice  the  odd tone of his voice -the words repeated are exactly the same in  each instance they are used-does not sound like the  voice and tempo of a very gifted orator at all
#####
This video is fake Its been altered. MLK referring to a guaranteed annual minimum wage income...NOT universal income..not a handout...SHAME ON YOU YANG..
#####
I literally have people on a Bernie Sander's Facebook page saying "MLK never said that" when I show them a picture of MLK with a caption of his UBI quote. So many people do not know what MLK was really fighting for and that's sad. Yet, they claim to love and respect his work.
#####
The thumbnail advertising the next Yang video destroys the experience. Let MLK speak.
#####
This needs to be on BET!!!!
#####
The first few second should be in one of his ads. Everytime Mr King talks it's powerful. Then Andrew can say the same thing right after.
#####
Was this snip from  his speech " The Other America "¬†?
#####
THIS HAS ALOT OF CUTS TO MAKE HIS SPEECH SOUND LIKE HE WAS FOR SOCIALISM FREE MONEY AND REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. HE WAS AGAINST INCOME INEQUALITY BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES THAT SHOT HIM IN THE FACE FOR SPEAKING OUT ABOUT IT.   HE WAS FOR CONSERVING THE VALUES AND TRADITIONS OF CHRISTIANS AND WANTED ALL PEOPLE TO BE FREE FROM SLAVERY AND THE HATRED AND LABELING THAT DEMOCRATS CREATED.   SO THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SHOT MARTIAN LUTHER KING IN THE FACE FOR BEING REPUBLICAN.
#####
i hope andrew yang wont meet the same fate so martin luther king :c.
#####
This is a message that means something Mr. Yang.
#####
A visionary! Thank you Mr. Yang for keeping this conversation alive during the 2020 presidential election. I‚Äôll keep my monthly campaign contributions going to you. You have a vision that makes the most cents of all the candidates!!!
#####
Yang Gang!
#####
We need this
#####
This video needs to be re-post
#####
It was foolish then and it‚Äôs foolish now.
#####
where is this from???
#####
could you post this without the yang watermarks at the end. You cut off a good amount of the video.
#####
It would give the control to the American People and the super wealthy don't like that.
#####
AI is overhyped
#####
You forgot the part where he said "to all that need it."
#####
Whoever made this ought to remove the yang ads from the video at 0:25 because it covers up the the video which still has another 20 seconds left.
#####
"Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline." MLK (1967) "Where Do We Go From Here? Chaos or Community"
#####
Yang will continue what this legend has started, #AndrewYang2020
#####
Yang got it in spades! Bring it home!
#####
UBI (Universal Basic Income) & UBS (Universal Basic Services).
#####
I'm just now realizing I don't think I'd ever heard MLK's voice before...
#####
*IF YOU CARE ABOUT HUMANITY, VOTE YANG2020!!!*
#####
Wow
#####
I've read detractors of Yang saying that this is just a soundbite and MLK is not actually talking about UBI here. I'm interested in the truth and I'm willing to play devil's advocate, so I looked it up to the best of my abilities. Based on his own writings, he was absolutely advocating for UBI, and of course you can research this yourself.

In a way I don't even care, either UBI is a good idea or it isn't, and we should judge that based on the current situation, but it's nice to see that MLK was in favor of it as well
#####
How do we keep the peace with an idea like this?  What do we do when a radicalized group demands more basic income or that it be exclusive only to themselves?
#####
Your heart, and most people, is in the right place about this.  My question is: has anyone thought about the trajectory of the UBI proposal?  Given the cultural environment and divided times we live in, it‚Äôs only a matter of time (if not already) where the fringe movements will decry they should receive the most money from UBI.  I am not saying don‚Äôt stop talking about it, but it needs to be addressed what future risks this idea could propose.
#####
And conservatives still want to claim he was a Republican! üòÇ
#####
Why is this edited at 13 seconds? Half of the speech is missing. He never advocated for Government handouts. He wanted a hand up not a handout. Total leftist Propaganda.
#####
Oh this made me cry. Thank you so much for posting this!!!
#####
MLK finna secure that bag!
#####
He prophesized the yang gang bang. Man he talks funny, you talk better yang. Show me the üí∞.
#####
MLK's message of economic justice is too often forgotten. He was truly a prophet.
#####
My NeüÖ±Ô∏èro
#####
MLK understood the power of freedom.  Freedom means you have to have a subsistence of economic mobility that you are not under any coercive power of people of wealth.  Hayek, a libertarian, believes this.
#####
Mr Yang..I‚Äôm totally sold on the UBI, but what do you plan to do about the obvious racial issues in our society? Getting money is always great, but we need REAL issues fixed, not just to be paid. We need real reform!! Not just justice, but actual reforming of our society
#####
This is definitely baiting üôÑbut in this climate I get it üòº

Wow.

MLK carefully read and rejected Marxism. UBI is not socalism.

We almost past it in the 70's cause of this speech. Both Democrats and Republicans agreed at $500 a month. Then Democrats got greedy and said bump it up to $700+ dollars a month. Then Republicans said hell no. They also knew technology would get to a point were we are now and take a lot of people's jobs. Now we come full circle with 10 years max to implement a plan or we end up like France rioting for months on end. Now, remember France has been rioting without guns. It will be like a movie here.

Serve me quite well

We get it, but UBI can't be your entire platform. What other issues do you have plans for?
#####
amazing you got MLK's vote Yang, and mine too.
#####
Yes, but Dr. King's vision called for, and i quote, "some form of socialism in America." Also, it was to be source funded from the over-bloated Military Industrial Complex. Most importantly, did not end at Age 64 or 65, was designed to assure that nobody lived in involuntary poverty, and was to be indexed to rise with local inflation. Stay true to the vision, Mr. Yang, and you'll be OK. ‚úä‚úä‚úä

Holy crap even Martin Luther King wanted universal basic income! this guy Andrew Yang man he's looking like the future!
#####
He does make a great point about the competition aspect actually potentially bringing the price down. If everyone has money there's a large group who can make purchases, sellers can being priced down to make money profits overall as they can attract more sales.
#####
Andrew yang is an economic illiterate at best and a quack at worst. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what inflation is at all. If you give people more money, it will drive up demand everywhere, consumer goods included. Producers will in turn raise the price of their goods to offset that added demand to try to maintain equilibrium. Aka inflation. He correctly understands where inflation has been most dramatic but fails to understand why. The inflation in housing, education, and healthcare is not caused by consumer spending, it is caused by government programs like FHA, Obamacare, federally back school loans. All of this, able to exist thanks in part to the existence of the fed, fiat currency, and its easy money policy. 

Understand, inflation is non negotiable. There‚Äôs nothing yang, trump, Obama, or any other human can do it about it. Where there is more money, there will be higher prices. Point blank period.
#####
Does he not even know the definition of inflation?
#####
Where the fuck does 12k a year for everyone come from???
#####
It causes asset prices to rise!!!!! Especially real estate!
#####
I'm #YangGang 100% but I still don't see a substantial rebuttal to the claim of inflation because of one major factor: all Andrew's (and others) points are based on how things function now but, when a UBI is implemented, everyone know everyone will have an extra $1000 a month, which doesn't require any colluding because it's universally known.

Simply put, my doubts arise because I understand the competitive nature of the monetary-market system/Capitalism, which inevitably forces people to maintain profitability of their economic business, hence why I lean towards the thought that people (landlords, car salesmen, etc.) will just automatically raise their prices to balance out with the new universal spending increase that all people will have.
#####
If I'm 27 years old, and I have a job earning 50k$ (of which I saved 10k), plus UBI gets me 12k$, per year. After 3 years, I will have saved 3√ó10 + 3x12 = 66k, instead of 30k without UBI.
Now I'm going to buy a house with 66k in my pocket. And so do my colleagues and guys/girls my age. How does this not lead to higher housing prices?
Maybe a surplus of quality housing in the market drives down prices? Higher interest rates? I think the latter is more realistically to obtain (depending on where you live) but What do YOU think? Let me know your suggestions to control prices under UBI in the comment box below :)
#####
If we give everyone over the age of 18 $1000 a month, aren't prices going to increase? For literally everything? Making the dollar worth less. Serious question
#####
Why don‚Äôt they ask him why college tuition has gone up 2.5x? It‚Äôs bc they gave access to student loans and the colleges ‚Äúcolluded‚Äù to raise tuition rates. When a business of institution knows their customers have access to more funds, they will raise prices. That‚Äôs just how capitalism works. You don‚Äôt even need to collude. It just makes business sense.
#####
He is a good liar.
#####
I like Yang, but that doesn't answer the question at all.. guess that means the answer is it will cause inflation, rendering the dividend insignificant in short time :/ And it doesn't do anything the fix the system itself; the oligarchs will still own all the wealth and power. Bernie.
#####
Didnt answer. The question was how do you deal with the inflation UBI will cause, not how you deal with the inflation that currently exists. Sad people hear coherent language and assume it's intelligent discourse.
#####
He literally said inflation isn't affecting consumer goods for all the idiots thinking he dodged the question. If housing, education, and medical were cheaper we'd have more money for other things. We're paying too much for education and healthcare especially.
#####
Lmao, in many cities, like Austin, housing is absolutely driven by purchasing power.
#####
This guy is VERY dangerous. His proposal of $1000 per month per adult would require $3 trillion more in taxes, which ofc is impossible, so it would have to be printed... and that will cause insane inflation.
#####
Can someone explain this to me in a way I can understand please?
#####
Like with everything else, rents and housing are subject to supply & demand. Andrew Yang proposes to rezone areas to generate more supply for housing & low-income housing. State housing subsidies would also stack with UBI--which would only overlap opt-in style for federal welfare programs. Check out his policy page for more: www.yang2020.com/policies.

Also, as someone who has been working in the industry for years as a third party fee management property manager in Seattle, I would not risk destabilizing my community and losing residents by jacking up prices. Even if my clients were to ask me to do so, I would strongly advise against it unless we are providing a much better product (i.e. new amenities, upgraded appliances, better internet infrastructure, etc)
#####
The three things people are struggling with most are of the things government is most involved in.

Housing: Population growth isn't linear. The bad times beget the good times. The baby boomers dying is supposed to be a good time for young people in the housing market. Allowing for mass immigration creates linear population growth, and the housing market will always be pressured. It's also more expensive to build houses now due to government mandates. 

Education: Giving student loans increases the purchasing power of the students, and the colleges simply raise tuition. Imagine giving a pizza subsidy to everyone. Pizza places would just increase the prices to account for their clientele's new purchasing power. They also dumb down the curriculum to keep as many students in (for that sweet government loan money) and spend tons on frills. 

Healthcare: Extremely regulated. Limited amount of doctors being trained every year due to government intervention lobbied by the AMA when they feared a doctor surplus 20 years ago. Now the AMA warns of an upcoming doctor shortage.
#####
The predatory capitalist business elites will use every excuse in the book like $15 and UBI to raise their prices even more, lay off more workers and automate the jobs with machines. Which is why capitalism needs to abolished, buried 6 feet deep in cement,  and replaced with a Resource Based Economy.
#####
The fucking capitalists are lying through their stinkin yellow teeth when they say a $15 min wage and universal basic income would cause inflation. Truth is, inflation already exists. The real problem is that wages/ incomes hasn‚Äôt kept up with inflation and rising cost living since fucking Ronald Reagan in 1980.
#####
So much word salad.
#####
Here is a really thorough discussion of this question: https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7
#####
Watch his Joe rogan interview or the Ben Shapiro interview. All your questions on inflation and other things will be answered. The man is as smart as they come.
#####
Still not convinced. Rent, tuition, and healthcare prices are all gonna inflate, and the average American will have to go along with it. 

Now if those 3 essentials were fully or mostly covered by the government, then UBI could be worthwhile, because only non-essential products and services would be competing for those dollars. And there‚Äôs much more competition among firms at that level.

For example - if Apple raises the price of an iPhone I could tell them to fuck off, because I can easily find a cheaper phone or do without one altogether. 

But if my rent and heart-medication costs increase, the options are much more limited. If I don‚Äôt cough up the money for those, I‚Äôm potentially homeless or dead. My ability to fight inflation in these cases is greatly reduced.
#####
Giving everyone extra cash, is insurance for criminal vampire capitalists. Rent will go through the friggin' roof, EVEN more than it already is.
#####
Andrew Yang failed to answer the question of housing costs inflating.  He suggest because ‚Äúvendors‚Äù and ‚Äúfirms‚Äù will not colllude to raise prices.  Landlords and Homeowners are not vendors and firms.  Home prices will skyrocket as soon as one home in the market get multiple offers and is sold at a higher price.  The rest of the owners in the neighborhood will expect the same!  We have seen prices jump double digits already on an annual basis already.  Except with UBI they will see the UBI clear as day being given to each household increasing their income by $2000.  The market will adjust accordingly and quickly to reabsorb that money back to the top!    UBI does not add any housing inventory into the existing market.  We are back at square one folks!
#####
I'm for him, but question: how can you assume rational behavior from folks? Given $1000, how many are actually going to spend it wisely? And if they don't they'll still end up in the same economic position.
#####
I like Andrew but this is a poor explanation and a bad idea. UBI will absolutely cause inflation. Here‚Äôs how:

If everyone receives $1000/m extra, they‚Äôre not going to just sit on it. They‚Äôre going to demand/consume $1000 worth of more products/services per month. This will obviously cause Supply to go down, which will force sellers to increase their prices. This causes the dollar‚Äôs buying power to decrease, which means you need more dollars to buy the same products. 

UBI is not the answer. The answer is in harsh prison sentences for big time white collar crime. Think about all those despicable people in Wall Street who caused the 2008 financial crisis who got raises/bonuses instead of going to prison. 

Also, tax law reform and tax evaders, primarily super rich companies like Starbucks, who get away with paying a tiny fraction of the taxes they should pay. 

Last, we need to pardon ALL non-violent marijuana ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù from prison. (Andrew agrees on this.)

Should I make a YouTube video explaining all this? ü§î
#####
Because Yang supporters are often extremely economically illiterate and lazy about looking up information that does not immediately agree with giving them getting a 1k a month as a  bribe to vote for Yang.... I will simply post a video that talks about 3 versions of inflation. Yang will have all three, but pay attention to demand pull and cost push inflation. this is where giving everyone more money will cause an unavoidable amount of inflation and fuck you all over for a generation or more. 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USj52Vlvd5M



If you would like to stop pretending to know something about economics please look up Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell and just get used to watching something that tells you how economics works in reality VS how people like Yang can engineer economics. There is a huge difference between understanding how economics works and trying to *make* economics work like Yang wants to do through very high levels of socialism... that he claims is not socialism... despite his 'ideas" being the definition of socialism. 


Give it a go before you chit back mind numbing responses like "Alaska" and and... children's nutrition... and and printing is the only way to get inflation. All wrong of course but don't take my word for it, spend a few hours learning how you were taken advantage of by yang.
#####
This man has almost no idea what he is talking about. take away his 1k a month bribe and all his mindless greedy followers would instantly disappear.
#####
UBI Is the bread and circuses of the 21st century
#####
It is scary that people want someone so economically incompetent to make such immense changes to the economy.
#####
My husband makes $1,000 a month on his disability, which he paid into for 50 years before he had to use it. Every time he makes a dime they try to take away his Social Security. You give people $1,000 a month, all that's going to happen is they'll all lose their food stamps and Medicaid, or maybe even worse. There is no such thing as a free lunch, unless you're a mafia family that "owns" the government of a certain region. Just ask Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom, and the thousands of others just like they across the country and even the world. Ditching the ruling class entirely is the only way to achieve any kind of financial freedom for the average guy. (And end the Fed.)
#####
A really smart option for UBI would to make the 1000 dollars only last a month or it is poured back into the economy. Make the banks put the 1000 in a separate pool of money and once the month ends take whatever isn‚Äôt spent and put it back where it came from. This would make it so people would really need to get a job, and that‚Äôs where their saved income can come from.
#####
Commie
#####
if prices rise due to a new minimum wage which you can see today. 1K is going to go about the same way. It's going to rise prices. Healthcare, School, and rent prices all are far different from consumer market. The healthcare system is rigged, Schools are ran by the government instead of private, rent is based on supply and demand of the area.
#####
UBI wouldn't create inflation becuz inflation already exists. Best believe business' will take advantage of the UBI and raise prices even more tho
#####
Every merchant employing more than 0 people is *colluding* with the labor market.
#####
Funny he mentions tuition while pretending UBI wont have the same effect as government-funded loans. Enjoy the worthless yang bucks!
#####
If $1,000 a month doesn't cause inflation, why not just make it $1,000,000 per month?
#####
So he basically dodged the question
#####
Do you retards not see what Andrew is telling us???
He's literally saying the US government and big corporations have been laughing at our faces for MANY MANY YEARS, and yet all you people sit back and believe what the media is telling us. In other words, we all could've been receiving $1000 by now and it won't hurt the economy AT ALL. It's simple thinking, not nonsense BS talk that you hear from the media and all the fake politicians.....
#####
I like Yang, but he's wrong here.  This would cause severe inflation.  It's simple supply and demand.  Of course there's no "collusion" amongst merchants to increase prices, it happens naturally, just like it does now.  However, similar to a $15 minimum wage, this $1,000 a month would give a little bit of leverage to the poorest people, even with inflation.  The key to his UBI desire is the source of the money.  If the money truly comes from the wealthiest of wealthy, it will be good for the American people.
#####
So expensive health care, and expensive education makes clothes cost more? I don't get it
#####
UBI will cause Inflation!
Technology can not fund UBI like the way Natural Resource do.
#####
I love how he points out the three things that make Americans miserable are healthcare/education/housing, and they are the sectors most heavily influenced by government.
#####
Part of what's inflating housing and education is the debt available for it. Rent won't capture all of the dividend but it will capture some of it.
#####
That's just wrong you will get massive inflation you put a bunch of money into the hands of consumers they're going to spend it and they're gonna buy it they're going to buy the stuff and it's going to disappear it's it's simple economics it's it's simple supply and demand and these things these goods are gonna fly off the shelves and it's got a cause the price to skyrocket you gonna put a $1000 of people's hands and you're gonna have a loaf of bread cause 5060 $70 it's about idea don't do it.
#####
He didn't really answer the question
#####
Mr. Yang, you almost have me sold on UBI but I have one big question.  You said one way you want to pay for UBI is through a value added tax which is a tax that is always passed on to the consumer through a rise in price.  Inflation is defined as a general rise in prices.  If the value added tax causes a general rise in prices compounded by the fact that everyone is $1000 richer I see a major inflation problem here. Please reply.

awesome, you got my vote Andrew.
#####
The true problem with the UBI and why the Dem-Party can never be for it is:
-it would make everybody much more independent from the government.

-it would destroy all other government programs (e.g.  unemployment pay, programs for the poor, housing programs.... ) , and replace them only with UBI; which is all in the Democratic-Party ball-park.
-UBI would reduce the bureaucratic expenditure drastically. To the point where thousands of civil-servants are no longer needed.

This would give our government WAY TOO much control, sorry. When our government can turn on the mic on our phone and listen in, stores audio recordings from our phones for years so they can have access to them whenever they want, boldface lies to congress about doing these things. And now you want to give them control over another huge swath of money? I can see a million things going wrong with this concept. Our government was not created to govern the people it was created to protect the people, this is America and it doesn't run the way other countries do, and we like the freedom of that. We are the only true free country left, how about we keep it that way. Plenty of other countries to immigrate to if you don't like it, go to where you think you might like.

#####
How can he be so sure that giving free money will encourage people not to commit crimes?
#####
According to what he said 1.25 trillion has been spent on 126 welfare programs. Assuming these programs reached most people in needs. So  the additional money in the UBI will go to people who doesnt really need it. It is a huge waste of resources
#####
That's why UBI could break the ice into a new time. 

Some may think it makes you dependent, but UBI is universal, no dependencies. It is like a basic right to have air to breathe, or access to clean water should be such a right. And don't make the mistake of thinking in old narratives. It's not about capitalism or communism, it's about doing the right thing to empower people to liberate themselves. The world is complex, but complex does not always mean complicated. Listen to your heart. Most people don't want to fight, they want to find a reason to live. Sometimes this reason is the fighting, but think about it, mostly the fighting is the only way because someone is pushing you in this direction. Think about whether people shall have the choice for another way. Nobody is born evil. That's why a free choice is so valuable.
It is not about left, not about right, it is about forward. To be a productive being and to live a meaningful life.
Much love from Germany, choose wise friends.

I paid into Social Security it's not free, so the average social security recipient receives $1,300 a month will receive nothing under his plan while the guy making $200,000 a year gets $12,000 a year more this will go real far for income inequality and he would have to pass medicare-for-all before the Ubi otherwise Medicaid patients are going to end up with nothing

PURPOSE is what people need the most. I agree that we need basic needs met BUT one - if not the most - essential of those needs is the individual place in society and the feeling of usefulness. We need to come up with a way to address that together with the guarantee of basic needs so that we don't take away the need for purpose. No job + no purpose + money could be hellish.
#####
Conservative/libertarian here, one of the few Democrats I'd vote for.
#####
UBI is a very appealing idea. It would definitely help the lower middle class and the middle class for education, productivity and healthcare. But It didn't seem that Yang has considered the worst part as he was saying that all of this money will come back to the economy, which is very wrong. Because most of these homeless people are drug addict, once they get the free money, first thing they would do is to buy more drugs with this. This money is not taxable and will never go back to the economy. Even those who aren't homeless, mostly teenagers, will buy more drugs, especially marijuana, because free money is always taken granted. These will not go back to the economy. This is a serious flaw of UBI, and I didn't think Yang has considered that part sincerely.
#####
It is amusing as an engineer seeing people freak out about technology taking away our jobs. I remember being in college in the 90s when this new thing called the internet was going to leave us all unemployed. The hysteria we see about technology and jobs has been around since the days of the cotton gin being invented and before. The fact is humans  through technology makes certain jobs obsolete while creating new jobs. We adapt and create new jobs. Btw, people wealth is CREATED so unles you have a significant portion of your population producing enough wealth to be taxed for UBI you are going to get screwed.
#####
Supporter here and 100% for UBI. Please Mr. Yang, tell us step by step how you will make UBI a reality and prove that it's not only a pipe dream. Does it have to pass through congress? The VAT tax as you say will come from the big tech companies, how will you get tech companies to pay into this?  Will you have laws in place to prevent these tech companies and all goods  and cost of living to double or maybe even triple? When would Americans start receiving this UBI? Hope to hear your Answers SOON! Cheers
#####
Joe remove the vegetarian video, its nonsense, lies and misinformation!

Few questions, what‚Äôs going to happen with illegal immigrants that are going to come for this $1000 a month. Is the govt going to give them billions in handouts like the dems currently are? 
Also, he states that‚Äôs his tax base to fund the $1k per month will be coming from companies. Why would companies stay here if they‚Äôre going to be taxed like crazy then? Also, how would you fund that program if the overall economy enters a recession and the tax base isn‚Äôt where it needs to be from a tax income perspective? By printing more money, inflation?? What would happen to purchasing value of the dollar, considering housing prices, car prices, etc. will skyrocket due to the extra income and investment potential for them. I personally would buy a house with my extra $1k per month and rent it out for $1500. Now if everyone else starts doing this, then what did we really solve. Nothing....I would like to hear more than the cover story and I feel like Americans never look into the repercussions.....
#####
a nice ideology, a great hope that $1,000 per month would prevent crime, but this guy has no idea how macroeconomics work.
#####
LOLs, We tried to tell you that this was just another scheming hyper progressive who was trying to buy your vote (and not even for that much) but you said "I trust the Asian dude with the numbers"... Well that dude just said today that he wanted to tax "beef emissions." Thats right, Yang wants to tax cow farts, because he knows better than you pleebs what is good for you.
#####
Ubi is a good idea but we need to make it so it‚Äôs adjusted after money they make meaning if someone gets 0$ from work they get 1k of UBI but if they get 1k from work they will only get 300 of ubi. Not neccesairily tjhse numbers but it would be cheaper yet effective.
#####
I just found about Yang last night. Man it is so refreshing hearing a Democrat candidate speak raw economics and 0 identity politics.
I am not fully sold into the UBI program. Its a great concept, but what would stop some people from just wasting it all, or using this income to not work at all?
I will keep an open mind and continue to research more into his policies. For someone like me, who up until a few days ago was 100% sure I would vote Republican this is really interesting. Why are Democrats not pushing more for this guy?
#####
Holy shit now that i listen to the numbers that yang talk about it does look like a bleack future, ubi not so carzy after all

How would it benefit companies to go 100% automation when they need people to have money to buy their products? We have a few robots at my work but there's a lot of things that it's not worth to buy a robot for.

7:35 mark essentially makes Yang's UBI more beneficial to rich ppl than poor ppl.
#####
What about inflation? The moment you start to give everyone $1000/month, the worth of the dollar is going to tank. Sure, $1000 sounds good now, but what‚Äôs stopping companies and businesses from raising prices on goods and services because everyone has a little more money to spend. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone for UBI bring this up or even get asked that question.
#####
It's a ridiculous idea because human nature will make all of us raise our prices for services etc.    Rents will be raised,   most prices will go up.
   At first it seemed kind of good because i could use an extra 1000 per month for sure,   but after thinking about it it's a horrendous idea.    WITHOUT QUESTION you would see 45Dollar prices on hamburgers in an average restaurant.   Why the hell not they'll say,     you've got free money.       Yang is a bad person for not thinking it thru.       And ive worked with countless restaurant owners over decades,     they will of course raise their prices to ridiculous levels.
#####
The only evidence of UBI's performance I could find was in Finland where it "did not lead them (the jobless people given monthly installments) to find work". What are Yang's sources exactly? I can't find anything to back up this idea that it will help deal with mass unemployment.
#####
I was at a McDonalds not long ago that just had one employee behind the counter and 4 order machines placed throughout. Retail stores have already created self check out lanes. AI was in the future 20 years ago, the future is now. If UBI isn't implemented very soon then it'll be too late
#####
Where does Yang stand on immigration and health care? What would his energy plans be? How about military funding?
#####
Just look at the potential incentive for illegal aliens to further rush our border because of a handout,man this would be a steroid shot for some folks that love free stuff and just think about the kids they would produce. This is a sound good idea without deep thought,but they are not looking at all the various directions this could exploited by the elite and politicians! Please another tax is what I need,because a value added tax will start low and increase by leaps and bounds! It's never really enough just let me in the door and I'll fuck everything in sight tax!
#####

#####
We still don‚Äôt have a value added tax ... think about that.
#####
Replacement of people with robots only good for companies to save money to have good profit .they care not for people .money matters people don't .
#####
The concern would be that landlords or employers would just adapt to the existence of a UBI, raising rents or lowering wages to essentially eat up the extra money that people receive.
That seems difficult to solve and we are back to square one.
#####
A lot of the money should come from rent. According to wyse it only costs $85000 to build an apartment unit. Over 100 years that is $70 a month. You could put a 50% tax on rentals over $1000 a month.

You are never truly free until you have the ability to say "no" to anything in life without fear of destitution. People don't take jobs becasue they are passionate about them - they take them to put groceries on the table. That's not living - that's just an existence, and one which you are seen as a sources of taxable income. Either that or its things like prostitution which is dangerous, but is still done out of necessity rather than desire.

Also, people with mental health issues, anxiety, autism etc. just can't deal with a regular job structure becasue you never know when a bad stretch will hit, and even facing your own reflection causes suicidal thoughts. These are the people who are left behind by society and forced to apply for humiliating means tested benefits just to stay alive. They're not lazy, they just need a different kind of activity in order to contribute.

A UBI would do away with all these issues and give people the space and options they need to really focus on a direction that suits them instead of being herded into corporate jobs.
#####
But what if you look at the numbers?
#####
As a software developer, I feel Yang and Rogan are over reacting (and slightly fear mongering) in relation to automatation.
#####
People don't commit crime just because of poverty. He's making a gigantic leap by saying we would save $200 billion dollars in incarceration.
#####
UBI is bad for the same reasons that raising the minimum wage is... inflation. Both of which could bring the value of the dollar down which would then necessitate another raise in the min wage and a raise in the UBI monthly rate.

A resource-based economy gives you everything free. A technocracy..... no monetary system at all. The Venus Project is what we need..... political spokesmen and spoke women only put bandaids over the large wounds of human issues. Trying to resolve our issues by voting this political administration or that political administration solves nothing. Jacque Fresco created a system of abundance in humanity..... owning nukes proves the ignorance of today‚Äôs time. Use the nukes and create a radioactive planet.... oh, but you won the war, right?
#####
I have so far never voted Democrat, but if he gets the nomination he just may get my vote. This was all fact based and made sense. Why not try something new?
#####
*Please read if you are skeptical about the Freedom Dividend:*




From Yang‚Äôs emailing list:

*1. The Freedom Dividend is deeply American.*

At the founding of our country, Thomas Paine supported a Universal Basic Income.  Since then, Milton Friedman, Martin Luther King, Jr., Richard Nixon, and, more recently, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, and Tony Robbins have all been in support of the idea.  In fact, a basic income passed the House of Representatives‚Äîtwice‚Äîin 1971, before stalling in the Senate because the Democrats wanted a higher income.  Additionally, Alaska has had a universal income for nearly 40 years, where residents receive between $1,000 to $2,000 a year‚Äîand it‚Äôs wildly popular in a conservative state.
 
*2. We can afford it.*

Our economy has grown to $20 trillion, up $5 trillion in the last 12 years alone.  By creating a Value Added Tax at half the European level, we could easily pay for this.  No shareholders ever complain when a company declares a dividend.  This is a dividend for the American people, as the shareholders of our prosperous nation.
 
*3. The Freedom Dividend would create millions of jobs.*

With everyone in your community getting $1,000 a month, people would have more money to spend at local businesses, and these businesses would then create thousands of new jobs.  We know what people would spend this money on‚Äîcar repairs, tutoring for their kids, health care bills, the occasional night out, home repairs.  This would rebuild main streets across the country, creating economic opportunity outside of a few cities on the coasts and giving our children a reason to stay.  The Freedom Dividend would be the greatest catalyst for entrepreneurship in the history of the world.
 
*4. It would help marginalized communities.*

Women do the majority of unpaid labor in this country while also failing to receive equal pay for equal work at many institutions.  Because of this, they often lack the economic freedom to walk away from abusive relationships or workplaces.  Black families have a median net worth under $18k; Hispanic families have a median net worth of slightly over $20k.  Members of these communities also often lack access to family savings, financial institutions, and financial education because of a lack of availability in their areas or outright exclusion.  In the LGBTQ+ community, healthcare costs for their unique needs often come out of pocket. Additionally, many lose access to family support when they reveal their gender identity or sexual orientation, and this group is overrepresented in foster homes and homeless shelters.  For all these Americans, the Freedom Dividend could make a life-saving difference or allow them to create economic opportunities for their families and communities.  They could escape bad situations, pay down debt, and start to save and invest in their futures.
 
*5. It would eliminate the financial insecurity that has swept this country.*

40% of Americans cannot afford an unexpected $400 bill right now, and millions of Americans who work full-time‚Äîoften at two jobs‚Äîcan‚Äôt make ends meet.  It is impossible to expect someone struggling to survive today to worry about our greatest threats such as climate change or AI.  $1,000 a month would transform the lives and mentalities of millions of Americans.  It would give everyone a secure sense of the future, and reverse the mindset of scarcity that has overcome so many of our friends, replacing it with a mindset of abundance and possibility.
#####
my questions is how much it will effect inflation? With more income, companies can raise prices... supply and demand.
#####
The plan for UBI seems like it can easily be exploited. Also looking down the road this plan can run into family/marriage problems,

But there's a big problem with student loan debt forgiveness.  The minute you strike that debt, you've now unfairly penalized those students who took loans then worked two jobs (or a bunch of overtime) so they could pay-off their debt.  You also unfairly penalize those who worked their way through school and never took student loans.  You also unfairly penalize those who were practical by going to a community college for their first two years to save money instead of going straight to a 4-year college immediately after graduating high school.  When considering policy, you have to consider both: 1) unintended consequences and 2) moral hazard.  But I do agree with Yang that we have to stop brainwashing our youth into thinking that the college degree is the holy grail.  If I had children, I would strongly encourage them to get into the trades ... or being a Social Media influencer!
#####
I went to a community college. After I graduated I did a financial risk assessment and instead of transferring to an expensive 4 year school I bought a house. Sold that house 5 years later and made $55k profit and got all of the equity I put into it back, then bought an even bigger house. I also have a career and I‚Äôm doing good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Im suppose to reward their bad decisions that I was smart enough to avoid? No thanks I'll pass. They can pay their own debt

The problem with "Free" College is that all the colleges and college pro-fecers got all the calculus, trigonometry, number systems and means of doing things humans do for free from dead people like Newton, Pythagoras, Franklin, Tesla and so on, why they use fear and propaganda to kidnap hold hostage and then resell this knowledge they got for free Gods Favorite Angel only knows.
#####
Take the middleman, the government out of the equation. But the college's loan directly to the students.

If Yang is on the primary ticket I'm voting for him. If he runs as an independent I'm still probably voting for him.

Yang is too sensible for politics

How about we get government spending under control and reduce taxs.. instead of making a new tax to pay for "free"  college....

Actually the difference in college loans and regular loans is the interest.  Banks can make up the loss from private loans because of a higher interest rate.  School loans , however, are at such a low rate, the money can't be made up.

As much as I agree with this I feel like all the people who actually saved money and worked hard to pay off college and did it right would be beyond pissed because they dont get any debt forgiveness or any of their money back.

It would be interesting to know how inflation would react with $1,000 USD more in the bank. I think things like rent would adjust and become even more expensive.
#####
I was 100% convinced that college was a necessity, and only realized that it wasn't when I was done and in debt
#####
I'm for free education at all levels and so far this guy's reasoning and arguments against it seem to be the best (that's if he did actually do this promise of $1 000 a month to every adult).
#####
His words are painfully close to what I'm stuck in. Peer pressured into college because of highschool friends and family only to see how unnecessarily bloated the whole system is. Especially the part where jobs may no longer exist. My father was a brilliant financial mathematician who now holds a useless degree because banks won't have him. Now I'm supposed to go to college for what exactly? Debt? I'd sooner kill myself than finish paying debt.
#####
There are a lot of courses in college that will never lead to a job. in an ideal world companies and government would design the courses around the jobs they would be used for. also study is a form of work and you  should be paid to do it.
#####

80% of the crap they teach in college you can just study it online without a professor physically in front of you in a physical classroom. Hell your first two years you are basically taking classes just so they can sell more classes to make more money and they don't directly make you better at your job. Sure mathematics may be important, English grammar and composition may be important, psychology and sociology and understanding how to relate with your co-workers and customers might be important. Understanding Beethoven and taking ceramics might be important. Physical classrooms with teachers leading it should be restricted to the most important topics related to your career field. That alone would reduce 80% of the tuition costs. Nevermind kids are staying in dorm rooms that were built and paid for 200 years ago and yes with renovations yet they are still paying for the place.
#####
The trades are a great way to go. You can easily make $200,000.00 a year if you figure out how to do something well and go into business for yourself.

Ok so, I never went to college and am doing well as a landscaper, and all my friends who went to college are either working fast food or small time retail. On top of that, they are in debt with no easy way of getting out, while im able to buy my own house and car.  Tbh I think college does 10x more damage than not going. If you want to be educated, educate yourself, dont let some liberal blue hair form you and ruin you.

Why should we have to pay for student loan debt? How about all the people who have paid their debt by working during school, working two jobs, working during the summer? So you want to reward those people by asking them to pay for somebody else's debts? Now sell that to the average American? Free education I can support for people making low incomes but paying of someones debt, definitely no!
#####
Free college would just add a 13th grade, a 14th grade, a 15th grade, etc.
#####
They keep saying these corporations/banks are screwing the students with the loans because they can't be forgiven if a person files bankruptcy.   The reality is the government is the primary lender of student loans.  And since those loans are coming from the government, the colleges jack the price up because they know they'll be paid.
#####

8:00-8:18 this. This! THIS. I remember my condescending high school teacher told me that electricians dont make much money and that I should go to college. Needless to say, I dropped out of college with zero debt and studying to get into the electricians union. I only wished I had done it much sooner. Get into trades while you can guys because plumbers, electricians, and other trades are always in demand.
#####
Only reason why Bernie Madoff's went to jail is because he screwed over rich folks too. You dont screw with the rich.
#####
Let‚Äôs not forget that if the government didn‚Äôt get involved, prices would not go up so high.
#####
UBI rewards people for doing nothing. More people will do nothing. Plenty of people can live off $1000 a month. Roommates and Ramen noodles. That aspect alone will hinder prosperity. It also will reduce income inequality, which is a bad thing. The more equal the income of citizens, the more equally poor and powerless we are. It's amazing how someone simply needs to be well spoken and word something differently for people to think they're a genius. UBI is a horrible idea. And forgiving college loan debt will just make tuition go up. More government is not the answer. Tuition would be affordable had the government not intervened and subsidized student loans. All of these left wing policies simply aim to transfer power from the citizenry to the government.
#####
WTF is he talking about!?! The government took over student loans in 2010. In fact, the #1 asset of the U.S. government is accounts receivable on student loan debt!! Yang obviously doesn't know shit about this issue.
#####
Instead of erasing student debt instead of free healthcare.. REGULATE THOSE INDUSTRIES

Rubbish system
Set limits on fees...force colleges to cut overheads/develop on line etc alternatives. Competition.
Cut degrees down to 3 years
Put limits on borrowing...expect students to be frugal and work part time
Cull degrees that do not lead to a productive career OR inform students and make them sign a waiver...no remission of debt. Blue collar workers should not be subsidising graduates.
#####
Trade schools need to be more promoted and there needs to be more. Blue collar jobs are the heart of the middle class and they all pay and are needed in every civilized country.

Oh no, did the education industry have its costs raised due to government involvement and lack of competition? Who could have predicted this?

I know! Let's involve government more and subsidize EVEN MORE!

"You just said a whole bunch of nothing" -Jesse lee Peterson
#####
Why has college gotten more expensive? Because more people are going to college and they're going on federally backed student loans. The schools know the government will cut them a check no matter how much they raise tuition. So between that and simple supply and demand, that's why college is more expensive. 


Also, since so many people are going to college that its become a debt crisis, the idea the government needs to intervene to make sure more people attend college makes no sense. The people who have already gone are not seeing a return on their investment. Why would you want to send more people to college? The people calling for student loan forgiveness are the very same people who were furious by the Wall Street bailouts and they don't have least sense of irony about it.
#####
So true, i went to trade school after highschool and everyone looked down on me for ‚Äúselling myself short‚Äù but now I‚Äôm the one with no debt making 90k  a year. Learn a trade people!
#####
I agree with him that college is not the end all, be all. But Bernie wants to erase all student debt and make college free. Which has nothing to do with the unemployment. That's not why he wants to do it. The problem with that is the fact that too many people go for the same majors and after the same jobs. Therefore the result is that certain fields are overpopulated, while others lack enough work force. The way you solve that is that you place limit on how many people colleges can accept for certain majors.
#####
There is no such thing as free college. The government ends of stealing from people who earned their money in order to give it to people who did not earn it. I've already paid back $100,000 in student loans and I worked my ass off and sacrificed to do so. It's absolutely immoral to expect people like me to do so, then suddenly give everyone else no cost (to them) education at the expense of people like me. Screw that!!!!

Also very hard to find this, it seemed buried so I can tell it wasn‚Äôt promoted.

How did you get this?!  My only advice to this genius, use the headphone mic when doing webcam interviews, Andrew‚Äôs sound was very quiet, otherwise very productive conversation and new things coming from him on many topics. Great job guys. MATH, Yang 2020, Humanity First.

Kaya lahat ng alam ko itinapon kasi alam ko na lahat ng tao doon  walang kwenta. At hnd tumitungin sa kalagayan ng tao. Kaya. Nakisama ako kahit labag sa puso Ko.. dahil yun ang kaylangan...

Andrew Yang has my support. I have never ever donated to a campaign and I have donated to Andrew Yang's 3 times already, and will continue. He is intelligent, an experienced leader, eloquent and highly capable. He has the vision and methods to lead us Americans into a brighter, stronger future. Lets put our best foot forward with our future in mind, no personal agendas and do what's right for all of America. Give everyone the rights that most developed countries enjoy and have. Andrew Yang is the real deal.  Vote for Andrew Yang!

I like the UBI for all, but seniors should not be made to choose between UBI and their soc. security...soc. security is not welfare benefits, ..seniors work all their life and pay into a sort of pension plan and the govt. promise to give you SS ..so if millionaire bill gates is given UBI, so should all seniors ...without conditions and certainly not forced to choose between UBI and SSecurity--- does yang know that SS uis not welfare ?

The audio for Andrew Yang is way too low. Still thumbs up.
#####
5:15

Yang believes that America needs asian leadership.


He tells us that Asians see things differently. 

Yang reminds us that he is the first Asian American to run for president.

Yang tells us that he lives in fear of the white majority. He thinks that Asians are one generation away from being sent to camps or shot at by angry whites.

Yang reveals that Asians have their own vision for America's future.

"If asians wait their turn we will never get there." Yang believes that America does not care about Asians.

Yang suggests that America has set limits on how successful asians can become.

Yang tells us he has spent time with non asian politicians and "they are certainly no better than we are".

"We are going to make the White House the Gold House."

PARAPHRASED........

"We Chinese need to take political control of this country before white people turn on us."

Yang is not a serial entrepreneur, which is by definition an entrepreneur who continuously comes up with new ideas and starts new businesses. 

Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business. 

The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs. 

Yang has personally created two businesses. 

2.

Stargiving.com and Venture for America.

Yang is a typical entrepreneur, who has twice come up with an idea, started a company, then seen it through and played an important role in the day-to-day functioning of said company.

The rest of the time Yang was an employee.

EMPLOYEE:
1999 corporate attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 

ENTREPRENEUR:
2000 launches a start-up Stargiving.com, which folded in 2001.¬† 

EMPLOYEE:
Yang joined a healthcare software startup MMF Systems, Inc., as its Vice President and third hire. 

EMPLOYEE:
2005 joined friend Zeke Vanderhoek at a small test preparation company, Manhattan Prep.

EMPLOYEE:
2006 becomes CEO of Manhattan Prep.
2009 Manhattan prep acquired by Kaplan.

ENTREPRENEUR:
2011 Founded Venture for America.
2017 Stepped down as CEO.

November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for President of the United States in 2020.

So in all honesty Yang has 12 years of entrepreneurial experience spread over two companies, one of which was a failure.

In contrast a serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people.

Yang.¬† You just need to start one more business to earn the bragging rights of Serial Entrepreneur.

Untill then give it up.

Andrew Yang, Chi-com plant for the west to pump even more ideas of free resources to soft headed stupid Americans.  What a spokesperson for the 21st century technocratic oligarchy who will rule over the pesantry with their entrepreneurial spirit while the disenfranchised labor wont be able to afford children without being raised by the state propaganda.  No wonder he's pushing the idea of fear of white people shooting at his children in the future.  The truth of his UBI will be out in the open by then.
#####
There are 51 million people in America with IQs below 85. 

Yangs UBI will continue to encourage the growth of that underclass by reducing or eliminating the costs associated with their procreation.  

If as Yang says, the robots are coming for our jobs it would make sense to discourage the growth of that portion of our population most at risk.

EBI Eugenics Based Income is the best way forward. Simply pay those with IQs below 100 not to have children.

In a few generations we should see significant improvements in all areas of social measure.

there have been experiments in 'citizen salary,' finns just finished a trial period, without any immediate conclusions published. but conditions in usa are very different from europe. andy yang couches the ubi money as freedom dividend, because 'freedom' gets a few extra points acceptance. he's a pragmatic guy. since he's trying to turn usa custom and culture about 90 degrees, i'm inclined to spot him the language. at other times he is very pragmatic indeed: tipping truckdrivers out of work in a nation awash with guns is likely to be violent. there is history behind him there- rome kept its dispossessed farmers quiet with a bread dole.
however you wrap it, usa 10 years from now will be different. for one thing, china will own it. this may be better than andy yang- they can pay better than amazon.

#####
A lot of technologies are funded by universities and governments but taken and further developed to marketable forms by private companies, so the fruits of technologies should be shared by all people.
#####
I have a lot of concern about Mr Yang. Seem like another business man that doesn't feel he needs to have experience in government to be President, like Schults and Trump. He wants to give every $1000 a month to everyone and the office of President a 10√ó raise from $400,000 to 4,000,000 a year.
 I just get that tech billionaire dystopia communism for us. And the rich will still rule the world. No thanks.
#####
The amount of money you would get from UBI makes sense. It adds up to the amount someone taking up cleaning and driving gigs might get, or some financial help from a family member. UBI plus a 17 hr job gets a sustainable living and some left over to start a business or invest in an index fund. Education is ubiquitous now, it doesn't take much to find the how-to to your want-to. He's offering the opportunity to give Americans purpose and time.

I think it is hilarious that the majority of individuals that are against UBI never bring up a single concluded study of UBI ever. If it was bad there would be evidence in that data. And they ignore it like the plage while calling advocates of UBI ignorant of reality.

Yang fully admits that the problem isnt AI taking away jobs.

The real problem is that Americans are not prepairing themselves to transition to a new career should they face replacement by automation.

He tells us that 70% of Americans do not have a college degree.

The mean incomes by educational level.

Less than high school¬† $25,636 per year. 

With a high school diploma $35,256 per year. 

Some college and no degree $38,376 per year. 

With an associate‚Äôs degree $41,496 per year.

With a bachelor‚Äôs degree $59,124 per year. 

With a professional degree $89,960 per year. 


So you see there is a simple solution.


Have A Plan If You Plan To Have.
#####
Iowans are not as helpless as Yang and the Democrats would have them believe.

Yang tells the citizens of Iowa that the reason why the shops on their main street are closing is because of the big bad Amazon.

They actually agree with him.

Dont any of them realize that they are the reason for the shops going out of business?

They placed the orders with Amazon from the comfort of their own homes rather than drive down town and spend their money in the local economy.

They are the main reason that the shops closed and now their children have no place to work over the summer.

There is no one to blame but the citizens of Iowa.

Stop shopping on Amazon or at Walmart and eventually the local shops will return and with them the jobs and the economic prosperity of the community.

Or. Iowans can just embrace their victimhood and let the government take care of them.

Demoncrats do love victims.

Big business finally figured out how to get more money out of the hands of the rich and the middle class.

Just transfer their money into the hands of the poor.

Oil is a natural resource.  

Nature made it.

Technology is a product of human labor. 

Not the same thing.

Yang is offering the American people a bribe.

Essentially "vote for me and I will pay you $1000.00 a month".

Yang. You have no claim to the fruits of anothers labor.  Neither do those who would vote for you.

Robbing Peter to pay Paul is immoral.
#####
People of color are not being excluded.  They are falling behind because they do not place value on education.

Now you come along and want to remove yet another incentive from their lives.

Why not just pay them a living wage and close their schools?

You got my vote Andrew.

He is talking about quality of life measures.  There are various quality of life rankings published on countries and cities.  USA is not in the top 10. In the Mercer city ranking the highest US city is about number 30.  Canada has 5 cities in the top 30.
#####
Think about the taxes on that at the end of the year

The idea of a Chinese being president is hilarious.
#####
Parts of the reason other causes of death have overtaken car crashes as reason for death is that car fatalities are going down.  If someone dies in a car accident these days, they were either not wearing a seat belt or driving an older car.

We've have been yelling about how horrible bad it is in the USA since we lost WWII, and the evil media ignores us and marginalizes us insults us based on our skin color and love of nation.  They have made it impossible for us to better our lot in life via the political process.  Evil evil people we have to fight.

As a Republican...  I'll give in to the argument that future automation will require the need for a basic income or even single payer healthcare.....

How can the democrats justify allowing millions upon millions of 3rd world illegals to flood the country.

Wouldn‚Äôt giving 1,000 dollars a month to everyone fuel drug addiction thereby increasing overdoses? I know plenty of people who would use that money to buy pills or heroin and the only reason they‚Äôre not full blown addicts is that they‚Äôre too poor

one very wise and humane thing we could do across the country is to shift jobs that don't require a formal "workplace" from the workplace to home as remote or satellite workers. these big cities see huge swarms of people in the mornings all streaming into a central city with high skyscapers, filling those floors up and the thousands of cubicles with basically a lot of them doing "information work" using a phone and a computer, portable equipment tht can be used out of a home office.  we are stuck on the model of work in the industrial age when work meant a specialied workplace with equipment putting out widgets ....were iin the information age now. 



the cost of forcing millions of people to commute each day to a workplace they do not need to be at to do their job ...is enormous, huge, and ever-worsening. the cost to a parent is awful....we only get 8 waking hours a day, commuting takes about 4 hours of it from prepating in the morning, an hour to get there and an hour back, and a lunch hour away from home ....time stolen because we think having someone in a cubicle gives accountablity, crack the whip etc ...lol ....when actually remote work by computer would require metrics, performance measurements, nd be far far more accountable. try being a manager and poking around a staff's cubicle ...youd be SHOT.


WOULD IF MILLIONS OF THESE WORKERS JUST LOGGED IIN FROM A HOME OFFICE IN THE MORNING VS. TAKE AN HOUR TO PREPARE AND GO OUT AND START THE CAR?  MILLIONS OFF THE ROAD ........A PERMANANT REDUCTION IN TRAFFIC, IE. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMMUTERS.  THE FAMILY BREADWINNER GETS FOUR HOURS OF THEIR DAY BACK, FAMILIES SAVE BIG TIME ON THOSE COMMUTING COSTS AND DAYCARE, ETC...........AND PEOOPLE DO A BETTER JOB. 



And just maybe if more mothers and fathers worked from home and had more flexiibiliy and time, they might return to better home-cooked meals and see our kids less obese, too. 



The cost? Zero.

A grand a month would go along way in helping me build a food garden in my backyard. 
It‚Äôd help me expand my tooling and further my self education of the mechanical world
Right now all I can do is buy food and pay rent 
Only way I can get a job that would pay me decently would be going back on the road and never seeing my family doing wildly dangerous shit 

So yea 1000 bucks would go along way in building a life outside of just being a worker for someone else


Granted we have to ensure the people who control pricing of stuff don‚Äôt run the prices up to cover their losses and keep themselves in the places they are


Long story short gonna have to take some money from someone ... probably people worth billions would be a good place to start
#####
Yang is so full of shit! Do your research people and fact check.  Number 1 cause of death is ischemic heart disease and life expectancy hasn't decline for the last 3 years. Invite a demographer to fact check this guy. GDP measure does include portions of healthcare. Also, GDP is a global standard for measuring economic growth. What happens when only the US changes our measure? This is a global problem, to find a better measure to use. Leave this to non-political economists. Also, investment does not cause long term economic growth, proven by many models. What causes growth is to elect candidates that know what they dont know and stick with building teams of experts to solve problems that politicians cant.

So the number one cause of the decline in life expectancy is drug overdose and now you want to give these people of $1000 a month for free and you think they're going to start a bakery?  Give me a break.

Look at how Dems saved California by increasingly taxing businesses ... the business all leave for Texas.  Then California governor jacks up CA taxes and vehicle registration and gas tax to make up for loss business taxation and hurt the working class. See how good the Dem plan of taxing business is working out ... it hasn't.

This is AY's proposal on a national stage ... the permanent destruction of American's business workforce ... the subjugation of the population into govt food stamps in return for voting Dem ... this is the "Democratic Plantation" where we all all slaves to the Dem.

U want to be a slave? U want to have zero worth? U want to be a pawn of the Dems?  No thanks.  

There is NO SUCH THING AS  A FREE LUNCH AY. Anyone knows this.  Your "free stuff" is very expensive as it costs us our lives and future just so Dems can rule America.  T

Remember, AY has never shown how food stamps saved an inner city ... it only creates a permenent dependent class of drug addicts and gang bangers all with short miserable lives.

Every city that has been on food stamps never got off food stamps and are doing reallly really good?  No bad ... real bad! 

Dems offer free stuff is like a white van offering free candy and free ice cream. Stay away from AY's ice cream van .... or u will never be seen again!
#####
AY supporters are all previous Obama/Bernie supporters. Free stuff for free funded by supertaxing bad evil rich corporations (that hire ppl).

If u tax corps, they will leave overseas as they have always done. That makes more ppl unemployed. And that takes away from all tax revenue from businesses forcing AY's plan to tax the working class creating more burdens on workers. This deincentives working and makes everyone unemployed ... permanent ghetto food stamp drug addictted population as we have seen in all inner cities.

No thanks AY!

I support Yang but his stats on leading causes of death is way off. The leading causes are heart disease and cancer by far. It could be that suicides and overdoses are on the rise, but they are not the main causes of death in the U.S.
#####
We don‚Äôt need more handouts ass hat! Our paychecks are only dwindling due to increased taxes. If you are going to give certain people $1000 a month. Where do you think that money is coming from? My paycheck you commie cunt.
#####
You got my vote Andrew yang 100 percent!!! Finally a normal democrat that‚Äôs not crazy.
#####
I'm surprised by the amount of people that think paying everyone $1,000/month is a great idea.
#####
YANG WAS THE JAPANESE KID INTHE GOONIES!?
#####
This is the kind of person America needs right now, someone who‚Äôs willing to help citizens and make their lives better in every aspect
#####
Makes complete sense to me. Only problem  with 1k a month, is illegal immigrants using this... perhaps make it so only us citizens can use this, only problem is lots of immigrants will pop mad kids and use their kids to get mad money off the system. Don‚Äôt get me wrong 1k a month will help so much people and can really get a community running full throttle, but lots of people will find ways to exploit this.
#####
That's stupid. Suicide is up to the individual. Therefore if someone cares about their life expectancy going down, they'd be less likely to commit suicide, and their life expectancy just went up. Yang is such an epic failure.

This guy is awesome he actually wants to move faster and I agree we are to slow in the future. Like we are already close to 2020 already. Why are we still talking about gender gap and racism.
#####
Also, his ‚Äúpeople are going to lose their jobs to robots and AI‚Äù position is totally overblown. The integration of AI into daily life is gradual and people are not incapable of adaptation. As an intellectual, he tends to think of the ‚Äúmasses‚Äù as stupid and incapable of change. It‚Äôs just not true.
#####
Yang seems reasonable, but his economic positions are not. He‚Äôs still a redistributionist at heart and that is uneconomic and unethical. Subsidies don‚Äôt work. Doesn‚Äôt matter if he calls it a ‚Äúfreedom dividend‚Äù or ‚ÄúUBI‚Äù, it‚Äôs still stealing from one group to give to another. It‚Äôs bribery for votes.

Trump becoming president PROVES at least two things.........one........it does NOT matter who we elect as president.........two.......you need NO experience to become president!!

I would love to hear Thom and Andrew discuss Andrew's VAT implementation.  I know that Thom has advocated for a VAT to help with trade imbalances.  Yang's idea is, as I understand it, a 10% VAT on "luxury goods," but then that tax gets cycled down to consumers by way of the FD and then Yang asserts that it would be largely spent back into the economy.  I think that this is a pretty reasonable assertion.  


Yang thinks that this is a better idea than a national $15.00/hr minimum wage and I'm tending to agree with him.  This seems to be much more friendly to small businesses and while I've not got a completely clear picture of how he argues that this takes money from companies like Amazon and Google.  I'd much rather have a trillion dollar company subsidizing the dishwashers at a local restaurant than to have the owner doing it.  The small business owner will more directly pass his increased cost on to me.  If this is a way to legitimately take centralized capital (I don't know what else to call it) and distribute it bottom up back into the economy, _that's a fantastic thing._   


The criticism that I've heard against the VAT is that it's a consumption tax that hits poorer people harder.  When the VAT is used to finance Yang's $12,000/yr. FD though, someone would have to spend $120,000 dollars annually on VATable goods before they offset the $12,000/yr. FD.  The only thing that I see that the government would need to do is provide the truly destitute with some kind of VAT-waiver card that tops out at $5,000-10,000 dollars or so.  


The criticisms that I've heard of Yang's ideas on the VAT and FD have been shallow.  I would love to hear some nuts and bolts discussions of implementation.
#####
If we think about it, civilization is a mechanism or let's call it "machine" that humans intuitively developed to generate goods and services using natural resources, to satisfy "needs", that's all it is. Since the pharaohs, the "machine" used to work with a lot of human input (slaves, war prisoners, etc). After the middle ages and with the enlightenment and the rise of capitalism, humans have evolved from slavery to waged labor (some say slavery with a different name) and then society focuses in making the "machine" work with as less human input as possible because society and values have evolved. So it's interesting to see some people worried because there is no more "work" to do (waged labor, menial work, etc) , because after all that is the whole objective of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, and that is the whole objective of society, to need the minimum possible human work in order to provide goods and services, for people to earn more and have more leisure time to pursue more elevated goals than just chase the daily buck. Andre Yang seems to realize that and is trying to help people see the point as well...forget about left and right, move forward....
#####
UBI is a good social experiment.  i suppose WORK, JOBS, all the ethics and moral character building that go with them..... and all that is now passe.   WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING..?
#####
UBI will help people restore their social life and their communities.
#####
he's buying votes if he gets in this scam will destory the dollar.
#####
Yang I have a few questions for you because it seems your math is bad and further more that you are stealing from people, almost everyone in fact. 
First you use examples that upset me. 


1:Milton Friedman 


I like Milton Friedman but you name drop him rather than listen to him. Milton passed away so he can't defend himself, but I'm sure he would call you out for the con man you are if he were still alive today. Milton's UBI was for a small % of the population, it was a way of getting rid of an amount of inefficient welfare, but he would prefer no welfare. The UBI was a way to reduce welfare spending and clear up bureaucracy. The host in the interview most are now familiar with tells Milton that abuse would be rampant and it's no better than welfare... Milton agrees. The point Milton makes is that no one will stand to lose their welfare, so he offered a slightly better way to do it. 


2: Alaska Permanent Fund 


It's a bit shocking you talk about being good with math and push a UBI when the examples you give to support this scam have so many holes in it, and I believe you are aware of this fact as you are a con man. Your UBI is for 1k a month, Alaska is for far less than 2k a year. Furthermore not everyone in Alaska gets the subsidy, they have to qualify for it. Alaska is also not the whole country, goods can be bought outside of Alaska to avoid a VAT tax but in this case the tax is only on oil, not all business, meaning there is no VAT tax weighing down new business or even established business... thus inflation is avoided. The fund also changes based on profits, if you did that you wouldn't know how much the payments would be month to month. These are monolithic differences. You also sight 2k a year in Alaska but it only happened 2x in 37 years, waaay back in 2017 people received a whole $1,100 for the year. So you would expect at least a 11th the possible inflation compared to your numbers.


3: Inflation 


Inflation will occur because as I mentioned above you will lock the whole nation into a VAT tax, this tax will in fact drive up costs, many business might even fail due to the tax even if they push up prices. Rent will probably be the first thing to jump up in costs. Housing prices next as people run out to spend their bribes causing home sales to surge, and thus expand in costs. I assume inflation will start immediately but how long until the 1k bribe becomes worthless I can't say. 


Unlike in Alaska all new business will have to factor in a 10% profit loss that is their income, so if you own a business (small business more than large) you are paying for your 1k a month thought the VAT tax meaning if you own a small business you don't get any of your bribe. You will never tax enough as you are fully aware of and you will in fact be printing money. This time inflation will be felt because when Obama gave money to the rich banks they sat on it... they knew the risk of lending well outweighed safer internal investments. banks got money for well under 1% from the Federal Reserve, they hardly needed to do much to be profitable, so they sat on the money. The bribe will be spend in the economy thus inflating the actual money supply. 


4: Social Security 


This is where you dive right into theft. SS is not a welfare program so much as it's a forced savings account, the Government acts as a bank and pays the money back because many humans don't save or spend money wisely... Like they will do with the UBI money. If a person (over 200 million persons btw) paid into SS but the Dividend Bribe "replaces" SS then you need to stop taxing us for SS because we will never collect it. You also need to pay us back ASAP, all of the money anyone (rich or poor) paid into SS with interest. If you keep taxing every single person for SS then you are adding a VAT on top of a SS tax and in fact you will have made SS a tax rather than a program for retirement. Simply put, your double dipping for revenues, VAT and SS tax. 


I understand you give people an option to pick the Dividend Bribe over SS, but again all you're doing is steeling what someone had removed from their paycheck for a lifetime to help pay for your Bribe. If you stop deducting SS for everyone's paycheck you lose the funds to help pay your immoral scam to people. 


5: Jobs 


I find it fantastical that you tell people automation is coming and that this means jobs are leaving and will never come back. This is where you pitch the Dividend Bribe as a way to help people live as they look for more work or start a new business. There are so many conflicting points in there that it's hard to describe. 


If people can find other work or start their own business (creating their own work) then you lied, jobs are not gone for good... jobs simply changed. In that case the UBI is not needed and you would have to admit your error. However you have made it clear we will have more people than jobs due to automation, this is the crutch of your argument, using fear to sell your scam. In this case things spiral out of control... If people can't find work this means the Dividend Bribe is all they have to live off, but with inflation this hurts people on SS or depend on the Dividend Bribe to live the most. Rent will increase, the costs for goods will increase because unlike Alaska all business are paying the VAT tax and raising costs of good as taxes are factored into every single sale under "cost of doing business". 


6: Savings 


If inflation is an issue, and it should be a huge problem under the UBI, then savings loses value. Anyone with money in the bank is made more poor as their dollars buying power shrinks considerably. Would you tell a business to not raise the necessary funds to save and pay for a tax? Is that really the kind of advice you give people? 


7: Bribes 


The UBI is a bribe and I do feel you should be in jail for doing it. Bribing people to vote for you is illegal and you are doing this on a grand scale. What if someone in the Democrat party, or even Republican party ran against you claiming $1,500 for a Dividend Bribe is more in line with people's needs? $1,000 appears arbitrary, made up and based on absolutely nothing outside what sounds good but not toooooo gooood. 


How did you settle on 1k bribes? Why is this number so round... will it go up over time, what metric is used to qualify adjustments up or down? The Alaska fund goes up and down, does your bribe? In fact in Alaska you always claim 2k a year but many years were under 1k, in fact only two years were ever above 2k. A looong time ago in 2017 the pay out was only $1,100, so the adjustments can be huge. 2012 and 2013 were under 1k, around $900 for those years. Will you adjust your bribes where a range is 500-1000$ a month? 


8: Greed 


This UBI is based on greed, you can see it in just about every one of the supporters you have that talk about it. There are even support videos asking people how they would spend their Bribes, and it sure does feel good to watch... if you are greedy. Up front people are like, "I'm gonna pay bills, open a business," yet they never did these things in the first place, so why would they now? And how does 1k a month make a business possible?


You are an evil human and like to use dead people to support you bad ideas who can't defend themselves, like Milton Friedman. Now MF and Thomas Sowell talk a lot about mal-investment. When money is cheap people spend it frivolously, this means bad investments are made and at some point the economy contracts due to failing businesses and other bad investments. A recession occurs and prices dive as people rush to sell their assets for prices that reflect reality before they lose more value, often they end up selling assets for a loss. The correction happens and the economy heals. 


Watching so many heartwarming stories of people ready to rush out and open a business because now they have so much free money to work with seems like the world's largest recipe for economic disaster. Investments will be poorly made because "wtf does it matter if I fail, lolz?" The business fails and the person walks away, they probably don't even care if their assets rots because your Bribe pays some their personal bills. In that case items will cost more because so many people will sit on stuff being too lazy to sell, eating up resources and watching them waste away. 

You lie openly and it's upsetting to see people taken advantage of so easily. 

I'll leave with this quote from a man much smarter than Yang will ever be. This man was so smart he predicted Yang almost 250 years ago. Read it and let it sink in, don't react like a child, take it in.
‚ÄúWhen the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic.‚Äù

It is not a solution.  People are still going to be irresponsible with the money, spend it on drugs, video games, and booze, and up with nothing and then continue to attempt to externalize the price of their bad decisions on someone else.  What we need now, is a separation of moral people from immoral people.. and protection of moral people from  immoral people.  You can give two people $50,000 each, and in a few months one of them is going to be broke, and the other will have made wise use of the resources..  


The problem is that people expect others to always finance the consequences of their bad decisions.   That problem is not going to be solved just by giving people money..

The only reason man has stayed ahead of machines throughout history is we had the ability to learn new skills and the machines did not. That attribute is not longer a monopoly for humanity. As bleak a picture as Andrew is painting? Its actually much worse. I have been studying the implications of technological unemployment for 6 years. There is virtually no area of the economy that will be untouched by AI in the next 10 years. This technology is not moving in a linear manner. It is expanding its capabilities exponentially just like Moore's law of computing, only faster. It is doubling its capabilities every 12 months at half the cost. 2 4 8 16 32 may sound innocent enough but by the time you get to the 30th doubling you are over 3 billion. If you add 3 zero's to the 2 4 8 analogy you quickly get a feeling of where AI is today and how fast it is now improving. Within 6 years the computational power on your average laptop will be equivalent to the computational power of the human brain, within 16 years it will be equal to the combined human races abilities.
#####
First of all this is what those in control want anyway, it will greatly push it all toward a cashless society. And one where those in control can create, destroy or transfer money almost instantly. But I figure they already control it all anyway, so why not get something out of it all with a universal income, its good for everyone. Second of all, the point is true machines will be doing all the work in time to come, faster then you might imagine. Here is why, business is all saving a buck and making a buck called profit. Thats what business is all about right, no one can deny that. Now to the serious part, if the machine can do the work quicker, make less mistakes, never take breaks, and on top of that dont btch or argue about raises. Who would you choose the man or the machine? Remember business is all about profit. Its obvious business will choose the machine over man. As that will make the rich man richer, quicker and with more profit. Its the very same reason you drive your car instead of walking, because the machine does a better job, a quicker job of getting you there right. Thats why humanity made machines in the first place, and they do their job well, far better even then man does. Now Im not saying its right here to choose the machine over man, but were talking about business here, and business is abut profit. So the rich man will choose the machine in time instead of man. So if this is where its all going, this is the future, might as well prepare and plan with something to help the masses along the way. And a universal income will help some, and some is always better then none at all. Think about it, its plain as day where the future is going, and why its going there. There is no way to not see it or know this. Someone needs to think about helping the people along during this as it happens. Universal income is a good idea in my opinion. And it benefits everyone, not only just the rich, so its also a decent thing as well.

My concern is a capitalist economy will gobble up the extra income. Businesses large and small will all raise the prices of goods and services, employers will keep wages flat, and the local public sector will raise every tax they can justifying it on the usual expenditures like infrastructure, education, etc. Within a very short period of time we'll be right back where we started.
#####
Beware of elites bearing gifts.
It's a "solution" that's designed to perpetuate and permanentize the structure of captialism in an age where that economic and social stratification would make no sense.
Basically in a completely automated world you'll have an extremely small inheritance fueled elite class a really small "middle class" who will be able to entertain the elites in exchange of a  slightly better life and a hypermajority under UBI that will be paid just enough  to make them dependant enough to prevent them from revolting.
Pair that with the upcoming life extension and augmentation technology and you'll have a completely walled off stratified society where the rich will be able to afford the abilities required for the last few jobs  while they get to live for so long as they can play a long game to absolute power by deifying themselves int he eyes of the short lived "peasants"

In other words UBI is one of the totalitarian final stages of capitlaism and in absolute irony it will be an even worse version than feudalism, the system that captlaism revolted against in the name of freedom.


UBI is not the solution, a post monetary system is.
#####
Besides, $1000 a month is 12,000 a year ... if minimum wage is 7 or 8 dollars an hour, and there are 40 hours in a week and 50 weeks in a year that is not even minimum wage for anyone.  How do they pay rent and survive if they cannot find jobs anyway?  What kind of solution is this if not just a bribe?
#####
Truckers are not going to get automated any time soon.  It may be acceptable for a Tesla to go crazy and crash everyone once in a while ... but it is not acceptable for a big rig truck to make a fatal mistake and kill lots of people.  There is no way driverless cars and trucks are anywhere near ready for prime time, and truck drivers unions will go crazy over this.  And there is really no reason for them to lose their jobs anyway.

These fake comments follow Andrew Yang around whatever video he appears on ... and they are all amazingly positive ... with no reservations, not questions?  Imagine that.  What a bunch of BS.  I think UBI could work, but whoever is going to ask for trillions of dollars to be spent needs to have more than a giveaway bribe to vote for him for President ... I think.  How about explaining the what, hows and whys of this, and not relying on fact comments to back up a possibly fake candidate?

This is exactly what the country needs, which is why I am sure the DNC will sabotage him to prop up their "moderate" corporatist of choice. If the people want him, they better fight like hell for him and ignore the coming storm of BS because the DNC and the corporate media are going to demonize the hell out of him.

PS: You know the drill. Now, they are trying to ignore him. If he gains notoriety they will attempt to discredit him, etc, etc. Then they try (and do) convince the people that he will be a "throwaway" vote and forced into an ultimatum choice between less Right more Left of the same guard, and nothing changes.
#####
When wealth inequality gets to a certain point. We are all in big trouble. If the middle class has no expendable income. Then producing anything will be pointless, becuase nobody will be there to purchase it. If so few have all the money the economy will collapse. The wealthy are only going to purchase so much stuff. While if the middle class is strong everyone is better off.
#####
Andrew has my vote.
#####
A problem solver, entrepreneur, most importantly the only candidate who loves mathematics...Andrew Yang got my vote.
#####
bought a copy of the book to check it out. Andrew Yang is pointing out an important problem that is going to smack us a lot sooner than we realize.
Rise of the Robots is another good book describing all the areas where automation is going to replace a lot of people. Your job may very well be a target. You may be surprised.
It is about time to shift to a 30 hour work week with the current weekly pay levels. There is a lot machines should do. Needs to be shared across society. How to do that is the problem.
#####
Oh and they never talk about COLA. Without cost of living adjustment, $1,000 can become worth $100 or nothing with the next Wall Street driven crash and/or inflation. A better solution would be if healthcare and education were free and there were affordable housing.
#####
I'm all for UBI, but what they never mention is what people are supposed to do about healthcare. As a person with diabetes $1,000 a month doesn't go very far. UBI will only work with Medicare for ALL.
#####
Even a $1,000 bucks a year would allow me to get my business license, get Adobe CC suite for a year, and I could legitly work from home while I raise my nephew. Because right now I am just sitting at home raising a kid.
#####
Not in "Universal Credit" form. British model is a total and utter disaster for the poor.
#####
Universal income should be donation based. That way people aren‚Äôt forced (taxation is theft) to participate.
#####
Ming Mongo is 100% right. Without housing, education, and healthcare as a right, you will effectively hand your UBI directly to either debt or rent. It‚Äôs a ridiculous and inefficient form of subsidy for an unsustainable profit making system. Yang knows this. He even suggests it go to student debt on his website.

We need Medicare For All, Public Housing For All, and College For All

I am 66 years old and my question is if we got $1,000 universal income for every person will they take my Social Security away? Because I can't live on $1,000 a month. I don't know anyone who can.
but if they give it to me on top of my Social Security then I could actually manage to pay my bills and feed myself.
#####
this guy seems to understand the fact that universal basic income means, basic income. 
$1,000 a month wouldn't quite cover a basic income for a single person. But for a family it would work because you would get it for each member. 
 A single person cannot live on  $1,000 a month, they would still have to have a job. but it's a good start and he seems to understand it better than most anyone I've listened to.
#####
if the elite allow it, they'll tweak it like the UK so that people get just enough income to lose their benefits, making them poorer.
We DO need to talk about how in 10-15 years half of ALL jobs will be eliminated by artificial intelligence and there are no replacement jobs.
#####
Just show me the math? What is the monthly and yearly cost to give $1000 to those from 18-64 and how we pay for it.

Bernie/Yang 2020 that card will beat anybody

Republicans say: "If you give "poor people" too much money, they'll just goof off." Actually it's more like if you give "super-rich people" too much money, they're gonna goof off... gamble¬†it away on¬†the stock market.... wrecking our economy.

Yang is so right on the economics it's not even funny, he talks about so many issues in his book that no one else is even addressing, not even Bernie, and he comes with facts and figures and data to back up his arguments.

Socialist pigs. Going to try and destroy this country. Brainwashing our lazy youth into thinking their entitled to everything.

I hope Americans know that we already have something close to UBI and it‚Äôs called ‚Äòcorporate welfare‚Äô where billionaires and millionaires that have bought the government are receiving checks from the government that have been paid for by us working people. Don‚Äôt be fooled right wingers, these corporations want it all.

Alaska has it, we almost passed it in the 1970's with $500 dollars a month but democrats wanted to bump it up to $700+ and then republicans said no way. We have 15 to 20 years max till robots and A.i take over 40%-60% of jobs. If renters raise people can leave to cheaper or 3D print a house (it's cheap to 3D print). The people with out money will cause the greatest boom in American history.
#####
I feel he should have a back up plan in case UBI fails IF he becomes President in 2020. And btw, there is always this person name Furrowed Brow who comes on every video Yang is in and calls him a fraud., etc. How immature.
#####
It should be done in the form of a Negative Income Tax to those in the lower brackets, so that money isn't wasted on giving basic income to people who don't need it at all. Also, there should be a universal job guarantee at a living wage for anyone who wants a job.
#####
To be honest, I will vote in favor of every single leftist Bill that gets put out there. I will only vote against them if, after being implemented and studied, they prove to not benefit the lives of the people who use them.
#####
I don't think society will go along with that. Things would have to get worse across the board in the largest job sectors. Yes I would support it, based on what's happened, as well where we're heading.

How to pay for it üòÇ
#####
welcome to planet earth now PAY UP sucker!  They've set this planet up like a resort / casino where people born on this planet have to PAY (Who exactly?)  (How much exactly?)  (For how long?)  for the privilege of living on planet earth ~ BUT ~ there aren't enough JOBS for everyone and 1% of the people on this world have all of the MONEY ~ so WTF?  UBI just might be the only option going forward.  As far as taking on some of the structural issues:  The 40 hour workweek (and especially now that it's often two people working 40 hours or more per week) needs to be rethought.  We should consider moving to a 32 hour workweek and maybe after that a 24 hour workweek with overtime 3X after that to encourage more hiring and the spreading around of the available jobs.   Wages need to go WAY up.  STOP taxing wages and let government get its money when we the people spend ours!  Another option is to first understand that the resources of this planet belong to the PEOPLE.  A very small and very modest resource royalty (like a penny a ______ ) could be collected and paid out to all of the people in the:  County, State, Country, World.

4:17

Andrew Yang confesses that he loves collective ownership.

Socialism.
#####
3:00

Andrew Yang contridicts himself.

He has said that the reason local businesses are failing is because Amazon is taking over the markets.

The truth is that Americans are choosing to shop on line instead of in their local economy.¬† It is a matter of convenience and cost savings.

Now he makes the argument that people will spend their $1000.00 a month in their local economy.

That goes against his own reasioning. 

Yang changes the narrative to suite his needs in the moment.

He cares about truck drivers loosing their jobs but ignores the 2.5 million people he will displace with universal Medicare. 

Yang is a con man trying to bribe his way into the whitehouse.
#####
What this is is another form of redistribution of wealth! This unfortunately is needed badly! We have allowed our selves to be propagandized and brainwashed into thinking cooperate welfare and trickle down economics work!! Simply put it doesn‚Äôt!! The rich enlarge just continue to get richer while everyone else sees their income become stagnate and eaten up by inflation!! UBI is a great way to
overcome some of the obvious hazards of capitalism! If we don‚Äôt do something bold like this our society will be turned over and civil unrest and perhaps even civil war will become inevitable! FDRs new deal was a redistribution of wealth and it worked for years until the capitalist bought their way out of it! Sounds like we need to truly give this a chance if want our society to survive!!
#####
I love this idea, but to what extent is not clear.  Sure you can start with $1000 per month per adult to help infuse money into the economy, but where does it end.  I‚Äôm only speaking philosophically in that humans need a purpose and something to strive toward.  If $1000 is the start, is the end a full funding and provision of every need?  That would literally cause the demise of the human race
#####
UBI is a TERRIBLE IDEA. You are going to end up paying via taxes the minimum wages that should be paid by private companies. Negative Income Tax was the old name for this UBI, and it was put forward by Milton Friedman and his cohorts from the Trickle Down Gang. There is a reason why the right wing loves UBI and you should be suspicious about it.
#####
We will never and have never reached full employment through the private sector!
#####
Sorry it has to be 2000 a month 1000 is nothing. But I will gladly take 1000 a month or the 12,000 dollar check in full.

Half this country don't even want health-care for all. Maybe within another 100 years if we stop regressing instead of progressing.

Can someone tell me why everyone thinks it‚Äôs ok to still let in millions of illegal immigrants?
#####
Can put on this $1,000 a month I have health issues this would be a great help
#####
UBI, or Social Security For All, can be distributed in such a way where it is separate from the rest of the economy and not provided through taxation.  Taxation is, I believe, the biggest hurdle to the potentially-universal support for this program because many people - particularly on the Right - don't like the idea of their tax dollars being used to assist people who they view as unworthy of humanitarian aid.  Money is created, every day.  This alone proves that we can craft a UBI system this way and that all that's left is to reorganize the financial infrastructure to reflect the ability to work in tandem with the natural world without resulting in inflation or debt.
#####
He should start calling it Social Security for All. Everyone understands what Social Security is and likes it. This is the same reason why it worked better to call universal healthcare Medicare for All. Also, it needs to also come with student loan forgiveness or else that $1000 is going to go entirely towards student loan payments instead of into the economy as a whole. I know they asked me to pay $1000 a month and I have no way to do that because I never ever even make a whole $1000 in a month. Last month, I made less than $400. The other thing that might happen is that people might pay part of their rent with the money. A lot of rents run above $1000, especially for something with more than one bedroom. If the money only ends up going directly to the banks or to the landlord, it won't have the desired effect on the economy and skeptics will say that UBI doesn't work.
#####
Good episode!
#####
I am on the fence about UBI honestly it will give the capitalist class even further manipulation of the market by eventually privatizing UBI making things even worse, OR they will just inflate prices to match capitalism will find a way to exploit it no matter what however it will give hopefully more free time for a while to allow for education and organization to hopefully flip the economy into socialism.

Redistribution of wealth is the answer. Yang knows this

You need to think long and hard about the implications and consequences of accepting Universal Basic Income. By accepting Universal Basic Income you are implicitly acknowledging and accepting the fact there is no functional place for you in the World economy and you are OK with that fact. By accepting the few dollars thrown at you, you are implicitly accepting the current inequality; the current corruption; and the current Imperial Wars and slaughter to keep the oligarchs in power. By accepting Universal Basic Income you are giving up your right to complain and protest for a fair share and your say in this World. 

I have one universal rule ‚Äì Self confessed Entrepreneurs, Corporate Executives and Politicians manipulate and deceive for a living - period. Consider Facebook and how it infers its services are free. There is an old rule; when you are unsure how a corporation makes its money as it appears to give away its services, just look in the mirror to see the commodity being traded. I would say the same about Universal Basic Income. The cost to you of Universal Basic Income is your future rights in this World. If the oligarchs are giving away money to silence you, don‚Äôt ever think it will just stop there. The remnants of social security and other government services would also be on the chopping block as well.  

Instead of accepting Universal Basic Income as a bribe to concede the World to the oligarchs, revive Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. Increase the tax on the oligarchs to that of the post War era (1945); return to the social security and job policies implemented by Eisenhower, and return to the Rule of Law that allowed governments to prosecute corporations and break them up to generate competition. I would go further and strip Corporations of personhood and have them justify their existence as a benefit to humanity otherwise they would be dissolved. Prosecute the oligarchs that have been slowly eroding democracy and prosecute the politicians that have corrupted themselves to allow this subversive treachery to happen. Create an environment where real competition and Unions can flourish. Create a World where Democracy is no longer a word used to illegally invade another country, but an actual mechanism the people can use to have their say.  If you accept Universal Basic Income, you will only be implementing a World of Lords and Serfs and once the oligarchs have total control, there is no return. 

By accepting Universal Basic Income you will be effectively removing any further justification for a democratic society; how can you honestly say you have the same rights as those who provide your needs for existence with no effort on your behalf. Your mind might be able to justify this for a while, but eventually it would give the oligarchs justification to further disassemble your rights based on the argument of your ‚Äúcontribution to society‚Äù; and the final shoe to drop would be the disappearing remnants of democracy itself.

Before I would implement Universal Basic Income to fix a flawed capitalist system, I would consider the flawed capitalist system itself. I would seriously consider a Socialist System as described by Professor Richard Wolff. His worker co-op model would be a more suitable system for the majority than the current capitalist monstrosity as it would bring real democracy into the workplace. It would have the majority select the direction of technology and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and not leave it up to the few at the cost to the many.  At least then the majority would have a say in the future of the planet and it wouldn‚Äôt be left up to those who are the most effective at exploitation and manipulation.
 
Might I remind of ‚ÄúThe Time Machine‚Äù where the Eloi were provided with all their needs by the Morlocks in exchange for some sacrifices as well? And that didn‚Äôt work out well for the Eloi. I always believed the World economy should work for all and not just the select few that control the wealth and the direction of progress. The oligarchs have created this World to benefit them and now intent to bribe you to allow their World to continue. Come in Sucker!
#####
I wonder how will it work for someone. Who has already getting SSI benefits $1000 a month. Will they get more money?
#####
A federal job guarantee and expanding Social Security is the better way to go a federal job guarantee pegs the economy to labor employers would have to meet the wages of the federal job guarantee Universal basic income attached to those programs would be fine but a stand-alone Universal basic income it's not a good idea
#####
UBI is a necessary step in what will be a painful transition away from the capitalist  economic model we have had for centuries now. It is not meant to be the be all and end all. Conservative estimates (World Bank) show major disruptions to labor over the next decades. The only real question at this point is: How bad does it have to get before constructive steps are taken? The longer we wait the more desperate and radical will be the response. If we get started immediately we can cushion what will otherwise be a very hard landing.
#####
hell yeah!!
#####
Awesome discussion Andrew, you got my vote.
#####
The government can not help anyone without harming someone else.
#####
The government cares nothing for anyone..the streets will continue to fill up with people and rather than UBBI the criminal government will continue to pay out the money to corrupt non profit foundation leaders who will use the trickle down economic bullshit that continues to drive people into extreme poverty
#####
Any large scale UBI system will require rent control, otherwise landlords will suck it all up. I'm all for it, but it needs rent control, and it's hard to see tech libertarians like that guy going for it.
#####
The roll out of universal income will eventually be attached to your real ID with a chip. That real ID will be used for all of your transactions and a way to go on the internet. There will be a digital government too.
#####
I suspect that nomatter how revolutionary your ideas are, once you're actually President you discover how hard it actually is to make those ideas happen. 

So it takes vision and an ability to rally people and play fair good politics.
#####
If automation affects retail workers and truckers mostly , then government only need to give income to these people. Why give to everyone. It is a waste of resources
#####
Correlation does not mean causation.
#####
I love listening to Yang. He doesn‚Äôt chase petty issues, he doesn‚Äôt campaign on identity politics bullshit and he doesn‚Äôt take cheap shots at Trump. He‚Äôs a rational, intelligent dude talking about real issues.
#####
Automation and technology do two things that nobody seems to consider. It makes production cheaper and more efficient which makes business more profitable and it opens up opportunities new jobs that pay more for less labor. People have worried about being replaced for a few hundred years now, and life only seems to get better.
#####
I never thought I would be voting left in my life. This guy is a genius and I'm with him.
#####
Bernie's ideas always have me tugging at my hair and yelling at the screen like a mechanic watching someone use the wrong type of gas.  Yang is a lot more sensible and most of his ideas are harder to argue against.
#####
I like this guy.
#####
If you‚Äôre a person that trump was going to save factory jobs, then trump isn‚Äôt the problem you‚Äôre the problem.
#####
Economics/jobs was part of the reason Trump won, but it also was due to other factors, including due to a part of the electorate which fears white Americans losing dominance in the coming decades.
#####
Tulsi Gabbard should be the president.
#####
Andrew Yang is a racist that fear mongers against whites.
#####
He said what I've been thinking that although we proclaim ourselves the greatest country, we are so ASS BACKWARD!

We cling to the dark ages.  Afraid to move forward.

This man is forward-thinking and could have my vote, but the powers that be that influence most will try to prevent it.
#####
I like this guy but I don't think Trump's election was primarily due to economics, though yes, that was a significant factor too. I actually think Trump was elected primarily due to racial resentment and a backlash to a black man's presidency. Did anyone see the tea party rallies after Obama was elected? Those people were foaming at their mouths, so angry and frustrated over a black man becoming president. When Trump started sending the racist dog whistles, they loved it.
#####
Hey, can anyone point me to the statistic he mentions about jobs taken over by automation before Trump won?
#####
Fuck Biden
#####
I'm a truck driver....Hope he not right about that.
#####
As long as he punish this universal basic income, he's never gonna win, his other ideas makes sense though

Yang wouldn't be my number 1 voting choice, but has been on my mind for the past couple of days, so much so that I decided to research his claim that economics explains 2016 better than identity politics.

Having said this, has he by any chance attempted to debunk Mutz's 2018 study stating the exact opposite to what he claims in this video? 

I don't mind people holding alternative views, but Yang's thoughts here suggest a 180¬∞ turn merely in the opposite direction of what the MSM parrots. Almost like a reverse narrow-mindedness unable to combine both claims at once.
#####
Trump been watching this guy he‚Äôs made speech hope you guys see it. Trying to sweep him under the rug. I hope the majority votes for him. We need The younger generations  gang up and vote for the Yang In 2020 its time for good news. Trump has no education whose runs by extreme narcissism(bullshit) UBI is needed to advance the need for AI.

Trump is a puppet for billionaire Zionists and does everything for the benefit of corporations he's aligned with and for people he's connected too even if that means fucking over the American people . He has allowed the complete infiltration of isreali Zionists in our politics , they have bought off or government. There covert operations in this country are numerous and we have been fighting there wars for over thirty years . It must end now before it becomes the end of us
#####
you must be joking right ? You do understand it is known and on record and was in the newspapers and he admitted that he was bailed out of billions of dollars of debt by a Rothschild bank , the person who oversaw all of this was a chair in the Rothschilds banking inc , Wilbur Ross who is now our secretary of commerace with no experience in politics .... other then the unemployment statistics that have been debunked many times please tell me one thing trump did that benefitted America not his political campaign and his pockets the answer to that is NOTHING. But off the top of my head I can name 6 MAJOR things he did for isreal . Like the embassy , that everyone in the embassy voted againest and even though we still did it , why is that? Oh yeah because it was a campaign promise to Sheldon Adelson who was a donor to trump that gave him 100 million , and it was on record and still trump lied and said no donors , also.what happened to draining the swamp? Is having the most Goldman Sachs bankers in your administration considered draining it? Is brining in war criminals John Bolton and Elliot abhrams draining the swamp? Or maybe giving tax cuts to billionaires? Haha i truly think trump supporters , atleast most of them really don't understand what is going on , they are fueled by YouTube compilations of trump ""owning"" someone ,  and there hate for the colored hair freaks that they label as liberals . And at the same time ignore progressives and all the ideas they have for changing how politics is in this country and many other things . TRUMP is a puppet for the billionaire capitalists , especially the Zionist ones . And everything he does proves that and if you don't notice it by now then you truly need to open your eyes .

I still want Trump to be President but if he loses in 2020 I want Yang to be the one to beat him. I disagree with him on some of his campaign promises like universal basic income but he at least has things I can agree on with him.
#####
It's a pity that americans don't listen to sense, you guys have had more than enough capable, smart people to help you. Yet you choose not to.
#####
I agree with this man almost wholeheartedly. He seems to be really looking at the problems however I‚Äôm not buying the solutions, well as I‚Äôve been hearing them at least. For all his talk his answer is still basically to throw money at the problem. Whether its student loans or rebranded UBI the solution is the same, throw money at the problem. As if people are somehow smarter & more virtuous than corporations, other organizations, including government. uhm we are just as flawed as them, because we‚Äôre all just people, people who make decisions, some good some bad. If throwing money to one group or organization didn‚Äôt work what makes him think it‚Äôll work if you throw it to another? After all these years you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd learn that this approach rarely solves more problems than it creates, often quite the opposite. I just can‚Äôt get behind that sort of message.
#####
Smart dude... I just don't think universal basic income will be much of a solution. I think it will have too many foreseeable and unforeseeable negative side effects.
- Increased Depression
- Increased drug and opioid use
- Negative effects on businesses who won't be able to find dedicated workers
- It won't replace other programs because no one will want to let them go... the poor will still want more assistance and so on. Leading to more dept.
- Increased delinquency... leading to increased crime, etc.
- And probably much more.
#####
I wish he‚Äôd run for 2024. Very smart and level headed but he needs to build his name because right now the Dems want to push their own puppet to go up against Trump.
#####
Stay away from Yang people he doesn't have any solution only using tactic to bribe people instead of coming out of any real solution.AI and Automation is future no one will stop it the reason is that industries pay n fund Politicians and political parties around the world.

Andrew Yang 2020
#####
Trump's purpose was to stop Hillary and the deep state..
#####
He would make a decent candidate if he'd not support the bad socialist programs and ideas that will drive up taxes and inflation at an alarming rate. 

We can't have free money and a basic universal income with minimum wages at skilled labor levels. Minimum wages need to be restored so jobs can return to those without marketable skills. All it does is increase competition for goods and services and creates a spiral of increasing costs which translate to inflation. 

The social programs should be focusing on reducing the cost of living and preventing it from rising and getting influenced by massive speculation like housing. There needs to be regulations to buying and selling. With taxes penalizing short term sales profits by non-residents so that there are none and maybe even a penalty making it a loss. That would help discourage investors from snatching up property and holding it for profit and increase the availability of housing in the market. Giving the buyers more choice and force the market to compete by lowering prices to where the buyer market can afford and occupy the housing available.
#####
This is a guy who can objectively understand a problem. He is correctly recognizing Trump became POTUS because of economics.
#####
Where can I go to research the potential changes when automation hits? I tried to look around and websites by alarmist and pro automation appeared. I didnt know who took a critical analysis.

Wow, he is too smart to be a dem!
#####
A Democrat who doesn't have Trump Derangement Syndrome and he's Asian?!?! We can't have that, defintely not gonna be the Democrat nominee

Trumps election was not about economics. It was about fearful uneducated "white" people being scarred of blacks and browns I.e. Racism.

"Whites" will get what they deserve soon enough. 

END NAZISM

Anyone proposing a universal basic income had better have a hell'of'a'good plan for dealing with illegal immigration.  You can't have UBI and open borders on the same platform.

i wanna slap this nigga
#####
There are too many predatory practices in business.  It is to the point where an honest, and good business is unable to compete when being unethical bestows their competitor an advantage and they get defeated.  Our system exploits the vulnerabilities of people, which causes a consistent degradation and total ruin of the general populace.  What it should be doing is exploiting the strengths of people rather than the vulnerabilities.  This is how you can tell that psychopaths are in charge.  On top of this, central banks and the fractional reserve banking system are steadily subtracting money from the public and giving it to the wealthy.  The reason they told you they don't want to talk about it, is because they intend to murder the impoverished using Malthusian positive checks on population such as war, famine, etc.
#####
He seems like a intelligent guy, I think that his UBI idea might not work though. It doesn‚Äôt seem to have worked in Finland for their experiment with it in terms of actually helping people get jobs and the like, it only seemed to increase short term happiness which isn‚Äôt surprising. He needs to have another platform to work off of, or have more ideas that I can get behind before I would support him. I also despise the focus on intersectionality on the Democrat side, so unless he stand as an independent, then I don‚Äôt think I can get behind him. But, I‚Äôm willing to listen to more of his ideas before I write him off. I‚Äôll wait and see.
#####
Universal income will take our economy to the next level . He's a very intelligent man . I believe that anyone who can't understand why he should be our president just simply doesn't want to understand. It's a simple formula that he created and it can change all of our lives in a tremendously positive way.
#####
OMG who is this guy and where did he come from. I love that he's labeled a Dem. Maybe those ppl do have some hope left

Getting a law degree seems pretty good to me. All modern business requires lawyers in some way.

I voted for trump and i place my next vote with you Mr yang god willing you endure the wrath and powers that be that will see to you not getting the nomination.
#####
Economics can be used in some cases, for some voters. A lot of it was still good ol fashioned racism.
#####
As someone who has always worked to support myself, and family later, universal basic income just sounds like making the entire country a welfare state.  First question-  Do you need a Soc Sec number to gain it???  Figure that one out...
#####
This guy will be good sorting out America ! But he hasn‚Äôt mentioned any foreign policy. He is too independently minded to be a democrat. This is where I don‚Äôt think he will be elected
#####
I think you could pass UBI ... at the cost of entitlements. Which I am all for.
#####
Honestly, Trump voters who voted because you didn't like Hillary, but are now tired of his constant crap. Would you vote for this guy? I voted Hillary but I am curious what other people think.
#####
I like him, but then again almost everyone is better than this clown we have now. Unless you are wealthy and/or invest in the market, Trump has really done little for you and has done nothing but divide Americans even further.
#####
This guy is so smart and likeable it doesn‚Äôt feel possible that he‚Äôll have a chance at being the nominee.
#####
I‚Äôd vote for him
#####
NOOOOO!!! IT WAS RUSSIA!!!!!!
#####
The fact that UBI is being looked at seriously is SCARY. Welfare with unrestricted reproduction is in itself a dysgenic policy, but to then remove even the slightest review for receiving your government dependency injection is going to lead to a whole lot of people not working or even trying to work, having a bunch of kids, and funneling resources away from the hands of people who are capable of allocating it to productive means, and into the hands of people who are unable to take care of themselves. Ignoring the moral issues involved with stealing money from people to "redistribute" how you see fit, this is a policy for the degradation of average talent and ability in our country. We need LESS government meddling in the market, not more.
#####
He‚Äôs wrong and it‚Äôs because of his bias for China. Manufacturing could actually come back to the USA without negatively affecting the economy and without affecting progress. China is draining the USA economy which is predicated on technological innovation. Tech innovation is slowing in the USA as China IP theft increases. Look at the solar industry, it was 100% innovated in America with nearly all original patents in solar tech coming from American companies however now it resides almost entirely in China.. why? Because they copied the technology and made it cheaper because they actually have a manufacturing base. If the USA gets its manufacturing base back, sure things may cost a little more, but the tech will be less likely stolen and our GDP will increase because we will actually be selling things again instead of watching our biggest companies like Apple see their market disappear in favor of the lower cost knock off China version.

He doesn't have to win to get his message out there. Plus with grass roots support, he could make some serious waves. Enough to where Bernie adopts some of his platform. I imagine Bernie would be open to some of what he has to say. And for the record, he does criticize Donald Trump. He sounds horrified that Trump is president. He just also criticizes the narrow sighted tunnel vision of the people in government. They're all about ratings and message, and don't care about what's really happening. I do, however, think Bernie is open minded enough to hear him out. This election is becoming more and more interesting by the day.
#####
Regardless of whether or not Yang gets elected or even becomes the Democratic nominee, I'm excited for his run and I'm especially looking forward to him taking part in the primary debates. It's important that he brings these issues to the forefront of American political discourse and gets people talking about the real effects that automation will have in the near future. Like the last Democratic primary showed us with Bernie Sanders, you don't have to win to get people talking about issues. With current trends national weed legalization is just beyond the horizon (and with it the end of the War on Drugs), Universal Healthcare will become a reality, and perhaps even we will see the cost of higher education plummet, and Bernie (though I won't vote for him in the coming election) was the first serious candidate to talk about these things.


Now Universal Healthcare is pretty much a staple with the Democratic Primary candidates.

"Donald Trump's Election Was Really About Economics"??


Oh, I thought it was because Clinton was being investigated by the FBI and voters knew she was guilty as hell.


Thanks for clearing that up...
#####
Yang is right on about automation and re-educating American workforce to meet future job demands, however, trumpism has been in the working for decades with at least koch brothers + mercer family + (russian/to be in the open) + god knows who else (trump clan, stone, mcconnell, cambridge analytica/facebook) in the background, to overly simplify trump with automation and job loss could be an indication that Yang, for now, lacks political savvy to run the country, however, he has great potential to do so in the near future, you go YANG!!!
#####
I was sceptical when I saw the first couple of titles of the clips with this dude, I was expecting an unpleasant experience but he speaks sense.
#####
If he thinks it's only economics he will be rather surprised when people laugh in his face.
#####
Everyone used to work on farms now less than 5% do, so when that modernized we adapted and new industries arose. No different
#####
we either need to adopt ubi or cut back on our population as automation dominates more and more.
#####
F universal basic income, that‚Äôs a joke.
#####
Freedom Dividend = Universal Basic Income.  Rename it all you want, it's all socialism & won't be accepted once the Republican Party shows it for what it really is.
#####
Well I'm curious, if this guy was on the podcast of a more left-leaning host would he be piping up about equality issues, white privilege, gender pay-gap nonsense, etcetc? Seems like the classic politician who knows how to appeal to his audience.
#####
A democrat saying it as it is and not using any political correctness...no this isn't reality.
#####
i don‚Äôt really think it matters who is in office i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see a period of any real monumental change for a while. like all the people who thought america was ‚Äòruined‚Äô after trump won the election, how much has life REALLY changed in the last few years?
#####
Mr. Yang stands no shot at PotUS, but I wish he would run for Congress b/c I think he would have a shot there, and from there he might get a shot at PotUS down the line.
#####
Andrew has great ideas, and he's right it's mostly about economics.  He won't win, but he knows that just campaigning will allow him to promote his ideas.
#####
We got 10 years left to implement UBI. You  can say that's not the right way to do things. But robots will drastically speed up after the quantum leap in 2020. When new technology gets brought in and computing becomes drastically better like 200%-1000% better.
#####
Democrats won‚Äôt accept yang. He should run as an independent. yang and Shultz kneecap the DNC for America‚Äôs sake. THIS IS WHAT IT HAS COME TO
#####
Trump won because people are sick of the libtards telling everyone how to think.
#####
He's full of it.  We all know it was the Russians that got Trump elected.
#####
Noo, trump got elected because men hate vaginas. Fact.
#####
*The answer to the problem of automation taking jobs is "universal basic income"?* Ah, but we rename it "freedom dividend". That is so Democrat.  He had me til he went there.
#####
I researched what Andrew Yang was talking about regarding the worker participation rate in America. He is absolutely right... The unemployment numbers that we been feed is completely misleading... Since 2000 we have been losing people in the work force like mad. Did not know it was this serious until I started looking at the right numbers. This is not sustainable and he's right we are tearing ourselves apart... Take a look at it yourself!

#####
anyone who doesn't believe that ubi is the right thing, is literally fcking INSANE.
#####
Anyone who can't overcome the zero sum scarcity mindset should simply be declared mentally ill.  Unless of course that person comes around to support UBI.  Sounds a bit Orwellian, but UBI is too important and denying money for millions of people or more is downright criminal.  Psychologists did it when they talked about toxic masculinity.  This sort of thing can be lumped in with toxic masculinity since male blue collar workers tend to think this way.
#####
Yang " I am not sure who the media will try to knee cap this time "  turns out it was him and Tulsi
#####
For the Berners here that don't understand why Joe would be turned off by that behavior from Bernie, it's because you need to know what kind of a person a leader actually is, and what Bernie apparently did is a really poor, dishonest and phony behavior from someone who wants to be the President of the country. It is not respectable. You think it doesn't matter because it has nothing to do with policies and shit, but the type of person you are determines how genuine you are and successful you are capable of being. Your behavior, especially behind the limelight, is a personality tell. That is why I can see someone seeing something like that and being totally turned off by it. Take your blinders off and you may be able to see what I'm talking about.
#####
The delusion among these democrats. It'll only be one of you chosen, yet they all think they're the one. Just the reverse of the republicans in 2016, with much less money and clout. Not a single democrat has boosted off the way President DJT did. No energy, no charisma, no nothing.
#####
I think Joe rogan is cool
#####
Bernie is a lifetime politician that has made millions saying the same bullshit and all these emotional ass people keep falling for it.
#####
Aw look at all these butthurt chapo trap tards. Keep those furry suits clean you sissies.
#####
Yang gang where you at?!?  Vote this man in. He has common sense.
#####
bernie has been a politicians for decades. decades to provide the 
American people with solutions that he failed to follow through on. any 
politician being interview on joe rogan would come across as likeable. 
oh bernies ideas are great, of course they are when you dont get to 
counter his ideas. go to other countries and see how terrible these 
ideas play out in the real world.

Yang literally just talked about how the media tried to kneecap Bernie all throughout 2015-2016--then as some "example" of why Bernie is "bad", Joe brings up a moment where Bernie avoided talking to a media reporter by faking a call. There could've a shit-ton of factors and reasons for why that "incident" happened the way it did. Talk about grasping at straws. 

Even Yang thought it was a ridiculous thing to make a big deal out of it, but he didn't want to sour the rapport that he and Joe had built up to that point, which is why he then said the thing (I'm paraphrasing) about "assumptions being made from less data points".
#####
Andrew Young: "kneecap Bernie lol"
One muted microphone later.
Andrew Young: Yeah okay maybe I shouldn't have laughed at that.
#####
I like some things about Joe Rogan but this is a petty thing to judge him on. Yes, what Bernie did was deceptive, but we all do deceptive things and after all the years he was doing good things, to just change ones mind because of something so small is petty.

omfg i gotta say i love mr yang for making me remember such a golden moment in comedy

Joe bases his opinions of politicians on whether or not they fake phone calls, instead of policy. Really woke Joe.

Howard Dean used to seem like a real progressive, but nowadays he is a full on Democratic establishment corporatist right wing douche. The Chappelle Show sketch is one of my favorites though. "I'ma go in that mofuckin Oval Office and chop that mofuckin desk in half like Pyaaahhh!" Chappelle is a comedic genius and supports Bernie I believe. Yang has good ideas on UBI, but I don't know too much else about his policies.
#####
Pretending to be on the phone is a lil weird but that doesnt mean i wouldnt vote for him or yang
#####
Not gonna lie, Bernie rolling over to the DNC and HRC after getting shafted during the primaries and not speaking up is what really did it for me. Him letting his rally getting taken over by BLM was one of the first instances. Pretending to be on his cellphone seems like such a Bernie thing to do at this point.
#####
Bro that was Alex fricking Jones. I also pretend to be on the phone a lot.
#####
you must be joking right ? You do understand it is known and on record and was in the newspapers and he admitted that he was bailed out of billions of dollars of debt by a Rothschild bank , the person who oversaw all of this was a chair in the Rothschilds banking inc , Wilbur Ross who is now our secretary of commerace with no experience in politics .... other then the unemployment statistics that have been debunked many times please tell me one thing trump did that benefitted America not his political campaign and his pockets the answer to that is NOTHING. But off the top of my head I can name 6 MAJOR things he did for isreal . Like the embassy , that everyone in the embassy voted againest and even though we still did it , why is that? Oh yeah because it was a campaign promise to Sheldon Adelson who was a donor to trump that gave him 100 million , and it was on record and still trump lied and said no donors , also.what happened to draining the swamp? Is having the most Goldman Sachs bankers in your administration considered draining it? Is brining in war criminals John Bolton and Elliot abhrams draining the swamp? Or maybe giving tax cuts to billionaires? Haha i truly think trump supporters , atleast most of them really don't understand what is going on , they are fueled by YouTube compilations of trump ""owning"" someone ,  and there hate for the colored hair freaks that they label as liberals . And at the same time ignore progressives and all the ideas they have for changing how politics is in this country and many other things . TRUMP is a puppet for the billionaire capitalists , especially the Zionist ones . And everything he does proves that and if you don't notice it by now then you truly need to open your eyes .
#####
Joe talks about a deceptive phone call YET continually talks about trump in a way that nobody can deny actually covertly praises him, I know that the theory that rogan is a shill for isreal might not be true but when he has people like bari Weiss on the show and doesn't expose trump for his obvious corruption and his connections to billionaire Zionists who really buy off political power from congressmen , senate and much more . Till this day its so blatantly obvious he does more for isreal then America in every aspect and does everything for his billionaire friends not the American people , but Bernie working for Americans for years and literally fighting for the working class even before rogan was on anyone's radar . SHAME ON YOU JOE because you are very wrong for this .
#####
Democrats ‚Äúgenuine patriots‚Äù. Hmmmm me doubt that.
#####
Bernie will be the reason Trump gets elected in 2020.
#####
Yep, Joe should think about this again, its dissapointing, but Joe has a capability to change his mind if someone gives him good arguments.
#####
Joe rogan doesn‚Äôt like Bernie because his taxes are going up stop caping üß¢ joe !
#####
I would do anything to avoid having to interact with Alex Jones
#####
haha Ya when Alex Jones come to you saying "death to the proletarian" or whatever stupid shit...and if you watch the video Bernie was ready to engage with Alex until someone told him it was Alex Jones appropriate response in my view
#####
Really avoiding question one time at an airport makes you lose faith in bernie sanders and trump avoiding questions all the time and lying when giving answers is OK. Come on man height of double standards.
#####
Yang's cool, but telling Joe that not using the nicest way to brush of a madman should not offset decades of fighting inequalities against heavily powerful and nasty corporations and their media would've been even cooler!
#####
The five stages of grief are on display in this comment section. Bernie is out dudes and so much the better because Yang (not to mention Tulsi) are much better. Thank the lord.
#####
"let go of your wang and go vote for Yang!"
#####
bernie sanders would be the best running mate due to his popularity
#####
Wow people butthurt over Joe's comment on Bernie? Doesn't really help the stereotype of the average American nowadays now does it.
#####
As much as I want Trump to be dethroned, no one can beat him with the current dnc line up.  Plus he is doing really good for America, if you think otherwise, you are a gullible liberal.
#####
Joe" The Kardashian" Rogan.
#####
Man if Rogan saw Trump pretending to talk on the phone, he‚Äôd be all about it. Bit of a double standard it seems.
#####
Lost my respect for Joe Rogan when he said he lost his respect for Bernie because he pretended to be on a phone call....

Nah not really but that was pretty lame. By that standard no one is honest enough for you
#####
I Watched that clip of Bernie on the phone. The quality of the video is complete shite, its impossible to know if he was faking the call. Additionally are people aware that with phone these days you literally can take a call and read texts at the same time.
#####
Lmao berinie is a liar for that but you all follow trump blindly

Is this another, like Bernie, useless 'commie' cashing in on all the fundraising to get rich quick? Probably.

Another tool that wants to give shit away to freeloaders for (donations)votes.

I can talk on my phone while on my text screen, I can play a game or be on Facebook all while on a call. You might be wrong.

"DNC turned over a whole new leaf" 


Cool story bro.
#####
Howard Dean had already lost the 2004 nomination to John Kerry on the night of the Iowa "scream". The idea was that Kerry was more "electable". It's a f*cking important point that is ignored.
#####
He can pretend to be on the phone all he wants. WTF are you talking about? How shady of him.. who was it Alex Jones chasing him through the terminal?
#####
"apparently?" You mean the most blatant election fraud in our nation's history. And they're doing it again, clearly.
#####
im pretty sure it was alex jones he was referring to?
#####
Yang is out of his mind if he truly believes the DNC has reformed in ANY way. They've only become MORE corrupt since 2016. They re-opened the door to Big Oil donors, they passed PayGo to block any major progressive legislation, they continue to ramp up a new Cold War, they continue to deflect their election rigging actions by pointing the finger at Russia, they just rigged the mid-terms... change? What change??
#####
"I don't know if that would happen today" "post trump we're willing to forgive so much more" *seconds earlier says he changed his mind about Bernie because of a fake phone call.* Sorry Joe, we don't all have time to trip ayahuasca and shoot human growth hormones into our dicks with every stranger we meet like you.
#####
And now I think less of both of them. All the corruption, deceit and democracy-killing bullshit of all the other candidates and you're busting Bernie's balls for doing a phone fake-out? Well congrats to your moral integrity, you're among the 0.05% of the human race that's never done something like that. 

And please, the DNC has gotten it's act together. I hope they paid you to tank whatever traction you had.
#####
Fuck off Joe. You've lost all credibility! I'm gonna side with Alex Jones over your fake ass
#####
No sure what phone he had but on my Android I can start a call then accidentally end up on the messages page and the call still goes. Can see the call though as top has a small section where you can press "hang up", "loudspeaker", etc.
#####
Until Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker of the house, I would say the old guard is still running the DNC.
#####
looks like i just watched 2 fucks talk about how the DNC is now great and Bernie is the deceptive one, lol.
#####
"And then the media, we have the sense that, you know, they're still feeling out who they're gonna try and put their thumb on the scale for." 

Oh come on. They've been propping up Kamala Harris for the past year.
#####
If Alex Jones ran up on me at an airport I would also be faking a phone call. Joe Rogan is such an assclown.
#####
Trump 2020
#####
Are you sure he wasn't on the phone
#####
he doesn't stand a chance i like how they say the country is on a wrong path our forefathers are rolling in they graves hearing the bullshit these idiots spew and you idiots believe what they have to say
#####
I respect Bernie, but I doubted his ability to lead when he let BLM hijack his rallies... same with Ron Paul, as he openly admitted that his name was on content that he didn't endorse because he didn't bother to keep tabs on his staff (and that was his best case scenario explanation).
#####
Why were they gonna kneecap Bernie? Was Joe on Mars in 2016? Wow. Short course: the DNC is owned and run by the billionaire class. Anybody who threatens their hold on power/revenue stream will be opposed by the MSM they completely own.
#####
'the phone was not on! you could see his text msgs' so which is it? was it on or not?
#####
Stop being an idiot Joe, look at the man's policy positions.

Bernie on the phone? Cool story bro

How did Democrats, the voice for democracy, become socialists?  Yes; I know socialism is economic, It‚Äôs still insane.  More proof that politicians are fuckfaces.  Trump won because we hate politicians.  I‚Äôve been alive long enough to have paid attention to 10 presidential elections.  The debates never change.  Same issues, mostly created by the politicians, same empty promises.
#####
CNN has already endorsed Kamala Harris as the frontrunner, with no evidence. Mainstream media always supports the establishment candidates.
#####
Bernie gets hounded all the time. Don‚Äôt even engage with Alex Jones.
#####
Bro have you ever done DMT??!brooooooo
#####
You can see my text messages when I'm on the phone if I text while I talk. 
Regardless, that seems like a pretty poor reason not to support someone.
#####
What the fuck is this about?
#####
300 000$ from Bernie a month?
#####
That was kind of goofy
#####
The Humanist Report uses that scream by Howard Dean every time he gets the chance to cover a story him, usually funny.
#####
I know the video joe rogan is talking about, some guy with a camera was following Bernie at an airport as he was waiting for his flight. Bernie‚Äôs body guards repeatedly told him to go away but he wouldn‚Äôt listen. That ones not on Bernie
#####
pretending he's on the phone?
that should be enough to ruin Bernie's chances
#####
What the DNC did to Bernie was straight up criminal. I wasn't even a Bernie supporter, but what happened to him was indicative of a perverse systemic corruption that clearly shuns anyone they perceive as an outsider.
#####
How do you know he wasn't on the phone?? Doesn't make sense how you assume that
#####
Bill Clinton passing the Telecommunications Act in 1996, which de-regulated all the big media and cable companies has been a disaster for democracy and free press. These corporate shills in cable media are a disgrace. It's turned into a propaganda industry for the Oligarchs & their politicians and the CIA & Deep State.
#####
Like not thousands of people including me hasn't pretend to be on the phone to avoid someone, especially ur annoying  ass girlfriend
#####
Is it not weird that these multicultural socialist migrants always speak in terms of "our Country" or "we Americans".

Complete bs. An American is a free person who can maintain a free society. You Democrats are mere peasants who are appropriating civil liberties you have neither earned nor deserve.
#####
Joe - who now doesn't answer the calls from Alex Jones (his own proclaimed hug buddy) ... he could just answer the phone & tell Alex that he doesn't want to talk, but.... yah..... character flaw starts now on joe for ignoring alex's phone calls.
#####
The DNC ....??? It was rigged ......many Americans (berniebros) votes didn't matter.   That is treason. That is the DNC wake up !
#####
Oh dear god, Joe. You used to say "I'm an idiot" on your podcasts and I used to think: well that's ok, he's not a politician. Now... you're just another CA moron with no sense of the world.

Bernie 2020.....  staked the positions we needed when many of us had crap in our pants. I'm a Reagan fool, bought the MILTON FRIEDMAN notion the harder you work the better you do FALLACY. Capitalism spins out to cronyism without control or direction. 
‚ñ™‚ñ™Crony Capitalism is a brownosers paradise. 
‚ñ™‚ñ™Intelligent discussion devolves into talking point propaganda. Weaponized psychological warfare that moves us to vote against our own families best interests. Like union protection, seniority protection, wage & benefit protection. Protection from predatory bosses !!!!

He pretended to be on the phone?! What a fucking moron Joe is.
#####
This may be the highest quality Andrew Yang interview video on youtube in both production and speaking points.
#####
Do you think Warren (Hillary 2.0) or Biden can talk  solutions like this?  All I heard so far are all anti Trump speech.  I want to hear solutions to problems .  I'm voting Yang!
#####
UBI will reduce strippers in the club and less escort. Not looking forward to that lol! üòÇ
#####
Albeit that Trump and Yang are both business men, after 30 secs of listening you recognize the distinction between the 2.
#####
Glad to see someone running as a Dem who acknowledges that it was "deplorable" Americans who voted Trump into office, not Russians, and it was because he promised them help. Even though he didn't really keep his promise very well. Most people are so sick of the BS Russia-gate narrative that ignores the US reality on the ground. Politicians don't get it. Andrew Yang does. The country is rich, at least its big companies are, but far too many of its people are poor. Spread the wealth. Trickle-up economy FTW!

UBI_8      Is Technology REALLY Creating Employment PROBLEMS?   YES!   Things Are GETTING WORSE VERY QUICKLY  ---   Technology is DISPLACING JOBS at an INCREASINGLY  EXPONENTIAL RATE.  
    When tens of million jobs are displaced by technology, 
      o       Where will the income base be to support the income tax revenue for our government and government services and where will  the payroll tax base be to support our payroll taxes benefiting SS,  SSI, SDI, unemployment insurance, Medicare, etc.?
      o       How will people get their living costs covered with no wages to distribute to them?
 
      THE TECHNOLOGY  WHICH DISPLACES JOBS IS NOT NECESSARILY AUTOMATION OR ROBOTICS OR AI.
‚Ä¢       Consider Blockbuster versus Netflix  ----  In 2004 Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and Neftlix had 900 employees, guess who won?   Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.   As of 2018 Blockbuster has ZERO employees and Netflix has 7,000 employees.  Technology displaced 84,000 jobs with 7,000 jobs, making 77,000 people jobless.  Netflix now takes up between 20% to 25% of all internet bandwidth in America.

‚Ä¢       JOB DISPLACEMENT FOR DECADES IS LESS THAN 10% DUE TO GLOBALIZATION AND PRIMARILY DUE TO TECHNOLOGY, reports a McKinsey Study of May 2019.  
      a.      The wealth and value added by technology is increasingly displacing the value added by tens of millions of workers.  Tens of millions of workers will be out of work or in the shadow economy of scarcity, of gig workers, contractors, freelancers, part timers, on-call workers, shuffling multiple jobs, short notice scheduling, suffering disruptive life stresses (juggling uncertain, unpredictable demands on schedules for child care, school, appointments, multiple jobs).  
      b.      When tens of million jobs are displaced by technology, where will the income base be to support the income tax revenue for our government and government services; where will be the payroll tax base to support our payroll taxes benefiting SS,  SSI, SDI, medicare, unemployment insurance, etc?  How will society's needs be funded when there is no wage to distribute, no payroll to tax?
       o     In the popular press, the blame has mostly fallen on globalization. Companies outsourced manufacturing to low-wage countries such as China so they could keep more of the profits, the argument goes, depriving American workers of jobs or forcing them to accept lower wages to keep companies from leaving.  The recent McKinsey study found that globalization and the decline of unions played a role, but only a small one. The firm estimates they account for no more than one-tenth of the decline in labor‚Äôs share of overall U.S. income.
 
‚Ä¢ HOW COME ?
       o     Most industries in the modern U.S. economy ‚Äî services such as retail, banking, health care and entertainment ‚Äî are not heavily exposed to competition from low-wage countries. A person who needs financial advice or medical help is not going to hire a Chinese broker or see a doctor in Brazil.
       o     A few important industries were hard hit, particularly auto manufacturing, McKinsey acknowledged. A lot of production was moved to nonunion plants in the southern U.S. or to Mexico, for instance.
       o     By far the biggest reason more income is going to capital ‚Äî businesses, investors, land owners ‚Äî is a sharp boom-and-bust pattern not just in the U.S. economy as a whole, but within certain industries such as energy, mining and housing. That‚Äôs accounted for one-third of the decline in labor‚Äôs share of income since 1999.
       o     The economic rise of China in the early 2000s, for instance, contributed to large increases in the global prices of many key commodities such as oil and metals. Producers kept most of the extra profit for themselves instead of sharing them with workers.
       o     Another big factor in labor‚Äôs declining share of income is a shift away from traditional investments in machinery and buildings toward high-tech staples such as software, data, processes and other intangible assets. McKinsey attributes about one-fourth of the decline in labor‚Äôs share of income to what it calls ‚Äúrising and faster depreciation.‚Äù
       o     Put another way, these assets wear out faster or have a shorter life span than traditional investments, meaning more capital is used up in the production process. The result is less net income to go around for both labor and business.
       o     What‚Äôs also generated more income for capital at the expense of labor is the rise of ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù firms and greater substitution of technology for people.
       o     Apple¬†would be a textbook example of a superstar firm. Alphabet‚Äôs¬†¬†Google and Microsoft¬†would be others. These companies generate huge profits by developing stranglehoods on certain markets due to innovation, strong patent protection or a lack of competition.
       o     What‚Äôs more, the groundbreaking technologies these companies produce have made it cheaper and more efficient for companies to deploy robots and automation instead of workers.
       o     ‚ÄúIf labor plays less of a role in production, for example through lower employment, its share of income can decline,‚Äù McKinsey noted.

What a really cool guy!
#####
Andrew Yang has an already WINNING PLATFORM for ALL AMERICANS!!!

Foreign Policy: ANDREW YANG is the FACE of FOREIGN POLICY! Hold his beer because 1.4 billion Chinese are about to witness that Andrew Yang is living proof of democracy that works! This is what call, ‚Äúwork smarter not harder‚Äù. Let‚Äôs make it happen Yang Gang!
#####
‚ÄúTrickle up economy!‚Äù It‚Äôs genius! Imagine the difference that would make to 250 million Americans where 79% are living paycheck to paycheck. Not enough to quit on but a significant amount to breathe and take that proverbial economic boot off their necks.  

     it‚Äôs not a rich to poor transfer per se like what other dems want with the wealth tax, He wants the trillion dollar companies that are paying 0 in federal taxes courtesy of the  loop holes in our current tax codes to pay their fair share via a moderate vat tax.

      Also by allowing welfare recipients to opt-in it would redirect some of that money to help fund the freedom dividend where we already spend $6-8 billion. 
   
       It‚Äôs about time the actual people of           America gets to share and actually FEEL the vast richness of this nation and not just HEAR about it. 

Humanity first.
#####
Say it with me. "No More Old Guys". Andrew Yang has ideas that could help America move into a future we can be proud of.

Jesus, we need Yang!!
#####
**Yang2020** You guys did a fantastic interview. Yeah, i got tricked by trump.
#####
11:03 first video in which Andrew explains how hyperinflation will not be possible in response to "everyone" having $1000.  This is important
#####
The truckers just need to get together and buy automated trucks bro and sit at home and count the money ....Problem solve and take your $1,000 also on the way ...ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Who is behind the camera and who is editing. This really looks a music video lol

24:45 this sounds familiar, original words for the song ;-)
#####
I have to say myself, everyone around me tends to lean more conservative and republican. And I do too on a few things, one being free money. So I‚Äôve been trying to do a lot of my own research and I‚Äôve been looking into this guy nonstop for a week. I find myself up at the wee hours of the mornings still watching and listening, trying to truly decide. He makes a lot of sense. But then again, so do some of the voices that have spoken against him. I‚Äôve heard him be called a con man, that the freedom dividend is a bribe. And I‚Äôm still very unsure. Though, and maybe this is the problem, I‚Äôm more hopeful that not.

Like Elon Musk and the Rest of these big wigs say were going to need UBI theres not really a choice, Automation is coming wether we like it or not

I'm a fan of Andrew Yang.  His vision is big and it does address the risks that developed countries are facing with automation, robotics and AI.  When ATM's reduced the need for bank tellers, they reduced the need for bank branches, they reduced the need for bank managers in every branch.  And on and on it goes.  Today, even fund manager jobs are under risk.
#####
Automation ,AI ,robotics, drverless cars are also happening in china . no staff restaurants , retail shops, ports, hotels ,convenience stores, warehouses, drone deliveries , ecommerce , etc. AI insurance and doctor consultation online.  Lol. It is happening even faster in this part of the world. Fir the Chinese cost control or cost cutting is the mantra. It means being cheap. They just want to do away the employees. No joke ,man.
#####
If a country has brown people and/or oil, and/or communism, chances are our tax dollars will bomb it!
#####
I'm so glad he's speaking the truth about retraining of the manually-skilled labor force as a fantasy because it's truly a fantasy, no disrespect, to think middle-aged manual-labor personnel are suddenly going to study computer science for jobs that won't exist for them by the time they finish their training. Both Dems and GOP are guilty of throwing this idea around to win votes!
#####
just wanted to let everyone know when they watch this....in 2018 the top 60 companies in the US paid ZERO taxes with the new GOP/Trump taxes.
#####
Yang‚Äôs willing to talk to anyone and everyone, not afraid to kick it with the locals. Hats off to Andrew Yang. I haven‚Äôt heard much from the other possible candidates other than typical sound bites and boring none solutions.
#####
Yang popping up on all these small time channels. Yang if you wanna play with the big boys you better turn your PR game up to 100 and make some noise üòÇ This guy will be the Rand Paul of the primaries. Smart as can be but drowned out. I think UBI is a bad long term idea anyway rhat won't resonate. with America except for low income and lazy millennials.

All monopolies will raise their prices. Like cell phone companies, internet service providers, corporate food producers, corporate hygiene product producers unless the government tells them that they cannot raise them. These huge corporations use thousands of different brand names to trick their customers into thinking that since multiple brands compete against each other, there is real competition in the market, but that's not true. These huge corporations (in the food and hygiene industry) need to be dismantled first to actually make them compete against each other to avoid inflation.
#####
Something tells me Donald isn't gonna be able to run for President from prison.

There's still a huge war to fight within this corrupt system. The deep state is still hanging tough in the government, and this guy is nowhere prepared to finish this war. They will simply blow air in his ear and hypnotize him, just like all previous presidents experienced and failed. We still need Donald Trump to finish this war. Cleaning up the swamp is still the priority. Until then, these younger and smart up and coming candidates can wait.

There's a very powerful deep state body that is running the government? The deep state is operated through what's called the SES (Senior Executive Service). SES has been an existing branch within the military system, but it was later doctored by him (Bill Clinton) to become their mafia tool for his circle's operations. Obama later took it to the next level and really bolstered it up as his own machine, obviously through the Clintons supervision, which is why he still has some powers penetrating into everything going on within the government today. The SES comprises of members from every high offices in the government, banks, they even installed some of their members into board members of social networking platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and they control the mainstream media. The SES takes orders from the banksters, from people like George Soros and The Rothschilds who run the Bilderberg group and own corporate America and all central banks around the world. These little guys don't have balls like Donald Trump to stand up and fight the banksters or the deep state. There is still a huge war going on within our government right now, and that's why we continue to see these obstructions and propagandas against our president. The deep state is holding on fast to their position right now because if they lose, there will be consequences. Some or many might end up prosecuted for allowing a foreign body or banksters to infiltrate, dictate and run the people's government.
#####
If you honestly support Andrew Yang then don't just spread the word but go and pledge from as little as $1 (or more) to get him to the debate stage in June. He needs to hit 200,000 and it relies on the number of donors not the amount of money.

You can do this for any candidate you support. So get the word out for your perspective candidate along with their site to donate to in order to have your support make that much more of a difference.

Andrew's site is yang2020.com

Yang/Gabbard 2020
#####
Read up on the sociological model "Spiral Dynamics" guys. That explains why he appeal to so many in this "mysterious" way. Yang is a well developed stage yellow. He has left his ego's agenda and now his agenda and happiness is in the bigger picture, through systems thinking and solutions, a more holistic world view.

Donald Trump is down on stage red. And the west is mostly stage orange with old people being stage blue, and juvenile social justice warriors crying in the next stage; green. 

Andrew Yang is basically 50 years ahead of his world
#####
Great interview, but very awkward when he assumed they were together lmao
#####
LOL

He says everything we want to hear [except $15 and college]. If you want Bernie, vote Bernie. I'm sure he will pick an experienced politician who has endorsed him last cycle

That‚Äôs why we need ubi, just like the blessing from God https://www.facebook.com/epochtimes.taiwan/videos/300444783969996?sfns=mo
#####
Who benefit from UBI? My take:
-Citizens who do not work and do not qualify for welfare or unemployment benefits.
-Citizens who do work at home taking care of kids, sick, and elderly etc. 
-Full time volunteering citizens. 
-Full time amature gardeners who love their backyard. etc.
-20 million college students.
-$1000 will have a big positive impact on low income citizens.
-Citizens on welfare will see less impact increase benefits are capped at $1000.
#####
So would retirees collecting social security get $1,000 on top of their regular benefits? My older friends have to try and get by on about $13k a year. Would they get $12k on top of that?

Tax cut policy (mostly to the rich) and spending bills (mainly to the big companies) - the trickle-down economy - have not worked for the common Americans as we all experienced it.

Joe.  Thank you for calling him out on the birth rates.
#####
Low birthrates are not an indication of being cash strapped.   It has been shown to be caused by modernity.
#####
Just like the Democrats to focus solely upon the negative aspects of automation while silmutaniously focusing solely upon the positive aspects of UBI.

A study in the UK indicated that for every 3% increase in welfare benefits you get a 1% increase in fertility amongst welfare recipients.   Similar studies here in the US show similar outcomes. UBI is welfare. It provides financial support to people who can not support themselves.

The average IQ of a welfare recipient here in the US is 90.

IQ affects employability.

60 to 74¬† "Slow, simple, supervised."
74 to 89¬† food service
89 to 100 Walmart
100 to 111 Police officer
111 to 120 Teacher
120 to 125 Professor
125 to 132 Attorney
132 to 137 Eminent professor
137 to 200 No limitations. 

IQ affects literacy and literacy affects employability.  Only 12% of U.S. adults scored in the highest literacy proficiency levels, and only 9% scored in the highest numeracy levels.

While 52% of Americans score below the minimum literacy required for coping with the demands of everyday life and work in a complex, advanced society, and successful secondary school completion and college entry.  There will be nothing for these people to do in the near future.

We need to start paying those at the bottom of the bell curve to not have children.  It is the only way to end poverty once and for all.
#####
This person is an intelligent one.... speaking reall shitt

Let‚Äôs not fuck this up
#####
Run again, Andrew. Run every goddamn year and do not stop until you win. We need this, the world needs this and we can‚Äôt afford to lose you.
#####
I don't get it. Wouldn't the UBI just raise inflation making everything more expensive rendering the whole thing pointless?
#####
He thinks all the hardships are very funny
#####
He openly said that AI can detect tumours much better than the radiologist but still talked about innovation as destructive. So are to improve people health and saving lives  destructive?
#####
Isnt birth rate low in most of developed countries ?
#####
To be fair Amazon does not make the stores to closed . Ultimately it is consumers who like the convenience and Amazon just found away to full fill a need. If the majority of us doesn't want to shop online can Amazon make billions profit ? And if Amazon ripped consumers off , no one will buy from it. It is how market works. Regardless of the side effect that Amazon unintentionally cause , he can not blame Amazon for that. A companies main objective is to maximize profits ,
#####
If truck companies are in shortage of labour because no one wants to do it , automation is clearly a win win situation right?
#####
Fuck it, I‚Äôm in on Yang and I‚Äôm a super conservative, economics degree toting, gun toting, engineer career having fucking alcoholic capitalist. My home state is shit. It‚Äôs worth a shot.

When I first heard about universal based income, I thought the guy was a leftist looney. This has definitely changed my perspective. His heart is in the right place, he‚Äôs pointing out issues that need attention. Although I‚Äôm not totally convinced to vote for him. I think he‚Äôs a very important voice in politics.
#####
Don't get me wrong a thousand dollars a month sounds great but all I see is people buying dumb s*** also guarantee the value of the dollar goes down somehow and everything gets more expensive because fat cat corporate mofos know you got money now how about $1,000 in food stamps a month and you make it a crime to sell your food stamps for money like the people do now where they basically use the government to buy alcohol and drugs

This guy is smart. Lets all start taking notes

The potential is there to create a Utopian society where we spend most of our time in a super realistic virtual reality where we can engage in any fantasy of our choice whilst the robots/AI do most of the work. The problem is that this just isn't in the nature of humans. The ruling elites won't like that at all and will seek to use this against the people to get even more power/control/wealth. What is more likely to happen is that we end up with an Orwellian type of society.

You see Joe....well Joe.....so Joe.....yeah Joe....this dude said Joe so many times it made me cringe. Sociopaths do that to appear more human. Like this millonaire knows ANYTHING of what the normal working stiff encounters. This asshole never lived paycheck to paycheck....he just "starts a new company" (his words) elitist prick.
#####
this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
#####
I'm not even american but I want him to be my president
#####
One thing the UBI automation supports fail to realize is all this coming automation is going to drive prices way down in the long run.  Companies will not be able to hang on to all their automation savings/profits for very long.  For example a high end law firm isnt going to be able to bill you $500-1000 an hour once their services turn into an app.  Its going to rapidly turn into a $5 a month subscription.  The amount of money someone will need to live a very comfortable life will be quite modest.
#####
Joe, I truly appreciate your point of view. You are able to listen to anyone and respond in a way that is based on a completely plum understanding of the world. BTW, I'm a robot, 1's and 0's in yo faceeeeeee...
#####
Dollar stores don‚Äôt do well when Americans are paid well.  It‚Äôs easy to blame amazon, and maybe it‚Äôs true to do so, but it‚Äôs also a symptom for a middle class getting paid about the same as they did 25 years ago.  The real failure is giving the incentives to the rich, when our economy is mostly based on the consumer ... the middle class.
#####
UBI still makes zero sense economically.
#####
Yang is spot on...

Automation will make the sociaty as a whole more reach, the question is how we choose to distribute the wealth.
#####
Automation is the future and thats good, you cant clinge to the fucking past, it never works out and it never will.
Now... the real problem is Bezos, that fuckstain is a borderline psychopath who doesnt give two shits abotu anything but himself, hell, he's just like the fucked up leaders that exist today (Venezuela, Turkmenistan, China, Russia, etc.) just in a tad different way. And he's not the only one, he's just so known because of Amazons size. 


If you ask me we need more educatred people, we need a revamp of the educational system, we need to teach the god damn truth and not history as written by some psycho's who push their own agenda (google for instance) 
The consequence of this will be an innevitable rewamp of the government but oh wait, here's where the problem arises, the government doesnt want that, the government doesnt want thinkers, they want brian dead idiots who will wote for their fucked up ideologies.
#####
Bullshit! This man do not deserve to me the American president.  Like give people free money?  It's encouraging laziness.  People should work hard and aspire to do more to be better not to accept free money.
#####
Would giving people $1000 dollars a month cause inflation? Wouldn't  everyday items like food increase in price
#####
Most Americans are too dumb to recognize who may be the greatest president of our times.
This is the only reason why this man may not get elected.
God, be with us.

Automate "Honorable Judge" in the Court of Law and other jobs that would save tax dollars.  Anybody trying to get that kinda shit automated as well?  It's just a set of written laws.

I'll be voting for Andrew Yang or it will be Tulsi Gabbard. One can be President and the other VP. I don't care which. All the others suck eggs.

good job guys. excellent questions.  according to Andrew the existing welfare programs would be replaced by the dividend on an opt in basis.  And yes this is only one aspect of a full rework of our outdated and broken capitalist manifestation.  He's listed 75 different policy stances on his website.
#####
3:10

The "freedom dividend" is not a dividend.

A dividend is 

a sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves).

Paid by a company to its shareholders. 

UBI is a tax.¬† It is theft. It is a socialist plan to redistribute wealth.

You would think that a self proclaimed "serial entrepreneur" would understand the difference.

The freedom dividend will not bring freedom to those forced to pay it.
#####
3:16

Yang is not a serial entrepreneur, which is by definition an entrepreneur who continuously comes up with new ideas and starts new businesses. 

Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business. 

The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs. 

Yang has personally created two businesses. 

2.

Stargiving.com and Venture for America.

Yang is a typical entrepreneur, who has twice come up with an idea, started a company, then seen it through and played an important role in the day-to-day functioning of said company.

The rest of the time Yang was an employee.

EMPLOYEE:
1999 corporate attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 

ENTREPRENEUR:
2000 launches a start-up Stargiving.com, which folded in 2001.¬† 

EMPLOYEE:
Yang joined a healthcare software startup MMF Systems, Inc., as its Vice President and third hire. 

EMPLOYEE:
2005 joined friend Zeke Vanderhoek at a small test preparation company, Manhattan Prep.

EMPLOYEE:
2006 becomes CEO of Manhattan Prep.
2009 Manhattan prep acquired by Kaplan.

ENTREPRENEUR:
2011 Founded Venture for America.
2017 Stepped down as CEO.

November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for President of the United States in 2020.

So in all honesty Yang has 12 years of entrepreneurial experience spread over two companies, one of which was a failure.

In contrast a serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people.

Yang.¬† You just need to start one more business to earn the bragging rights of Serial Entrepreneur.

Untill then give it up.

Big business finally figured out how to get more money out of the hands of the rich and the middle class.

If there will be no driver how is the truck protected against thieves hijacking the truck and stealing all the goods ?
#####
People don't like free money!
Except for women.
#####
Is it just me or Andrew Yang with his UBI ideas makes no sense. Truckers can make 70k  year. Now giving them 12k a year is such a joke. Besides from giving money Yang doesnt have a clue of helping these truckers to adapt to the new automated economy . You cant give some one a fish and expect them know how to fish
#####
I wonder how many people were telling pilots that they would soon become obsolete when autopilot systems were developed decades ago that were more advanced then than these "autonomous" trucks are now? The military even had B-17 drones back in the 50's. We should have had all drone airliners for 20 years already by now according to the socialists. Yet that hasn't happened and won't happen in the foreseeable future. Considering that planes would be a whole lot easier to completely automate than trucks as they encounter far less traffic and basically fly in a straight line I don't think truckers should be the least bit concerned. They'll just have a more advanced cruise control which I don't think they will mind.
#####
I remember when computers became more advanced, more affordable and mainstream people were so convinced that all of our jobs would be replaced by computers. Then technology created even more jobs and higher paying jobs. Then the internet created new business opportunities. There's more jobs today than ever before despite automation. This fear mongering has been going on for decades now.

"cOmPuTeRs GuNnA tAke OuR jErBs"

Yet, history proves otherwise so yes Yang is full of crap and using baseless fear mongering to push a radical agenda. Yang is just another communist utopian like the venus project nutters.
#####
What‚Äôs tf is joe talking about people don‚Äôt like free money.
#####
Ex military here and let me tell you something. To think that we truckers are going to allow this to happen to us is stupid. Most of us rather die on our feet then live on our knees. I‚Äôll be damn if ima bout to just lay there while I get fucked. I make good money to live the way I live, and provide for my family to. To think that men are just going to allow there families to starve, because of greedy company is insane. Together we stand of divide we fall!
#####
Detroit Become Human... the robots are taking our jobs
#####
Instead of VAT, why not tax a company based on how much of their labor is done by automation to pay for freedom dividend?
#####
Some more examples...

Antiquated systems and methods...

E-Logs...

I‚Äôll write about both of these briefly...

E-Logs and hours of service rulings are crippling the trucking industry and supply chain.
The hours of service rulings are impractical considering the conditions and infrastructure we have to work with.

Nobody making policy is smart enough to understand this, because the over educated dumb mother fuckers have never been outside!

They‚Äôve been in a school or an office their whole lives.
They‚Äôve never done anything.

Except go to school, network (Talk Shit) and hide in a temperature controlled office.

We are in a situation, where we need massive infrastructure improvements.

That‚Äôs a big part of the problem, why there is no growth in the economy.

You can only move so much freight so quickly, on our existing highways.

We need massive highway construction,  we also need massive high speed rail construction...

So, Ocasia Cortez is not all wrong, we need to tear down all this old fucked up run down, not rebuildable shit in this country, and build new infrastructure..

Homes and new communities for people too, like the homeless in California!

That‚Äôs how you stimulate an economy, and build a nation state suitable for generational growth.

Naw, we can‚Äôt do that, the military industrial complex has to steal all that money and resources.
Secret Space program too, for guys like Elon Musk and Jeff Basos.
Two dope smoking idiots...

No vision, no creativity, no ability to critically think!

That‚Äôs the kind of stupid fucking idiots we are dealing with.

From the top down, or vice versa.
#####
It‚Äôs going to be interesting how all of this plays itself out...

I believe in the end, good will prevail.

The White Hats in the Federal Police Agencies, and Military, will go (Hot)..

Turning on these greedy sick mother fuckers, and killing all of them like rats, right on their front lawns.

Like Clint Eastwood said, he always had the best lines...

Like in Grand Torino, he said with his Colt .45 pointed...

‚ÄúShut your fucking face‚Äù

Or.....from the Unforgiven

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt nobody shoot‚Äù!

‚ÄúOtherwise I‚Äôm going to kill you, kill your wife, your stupid fucking kids, and burn your house down‚Äù.

He was going to kill the dog too...

Most guys just don‚Äôt say how they really feel about things in this country.
They just remain silent, hiding in the background...

We know it‚Äôs going down the shit tubes...

An eventual total collapse...

Cause nobody‚Äôs doing a fucking thing to stop and turn it around, no common sense!

No sensible solutions.

So you wait for the collapse, then that‚Äôs when you get justice...

When you chase them down, at the golf course or the country club, and you end it....

Right out on the front lawn too.
#####
Tampering, obstruction, dysfunctional methods, lack of cooperation, these are not the symptoms, but these are truly the diseases of the collapse of Empire.

Chris Hedges, you can read about it in his book

America The Farewell Tour

If people don‚Äôt wake up to this, wether it‚Äôs the systems managers of the corporations, or the general population, all will be lost, and western civilization will collapse as the Roman Empire.

Into a giant fireball of ashes to ashes dust to dust.

That‚Äôs where all of this is headed guys!

AI automation, it‚Äôs not going to help anything, just make matters worse.

Think about this, simple stupid basic economics.

If people do not have jobs, good paying meaningful jobs, the manufacturing corporations have no way to sell their products..

Thing is though, there is more to this than meets the eye...

We are in a war with satanic illuminati child killing, child molesting freaks..

These are the people that own and operate these corporations!

Manage the systems of government, military and federal law Enforcement too.

There are millions of homeless people are over our nation, and these assholes aren‚Äôt doing not a fucking thing to remedy the problem?

Naw, but the automated truck will be their savior, to save their collapsing corporations that no longer make money...

These are the same mother fuckers that teach their kids about the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus..

Don‚Äôt forget the tooth fairy!
#####
Technology has hit a wall....

The true undeniable facts!

Example, the newer emissions standards forced on the trucking industry.

It has made the trucks unreliable, and now it‚Äôs crippling the trucking industry and and supply chain!

Good point too..

This is the last and final stand, the last and final blowout of society...

Truckers chose that lifestyle and career because of several reasons..

One big main reason that everyone is missing, is that truckers detest most people in modern society.

We can‚Äôt stand working along side of them because they are so, drugged out rude and stupid..

Truckers are some of the only people in society that are still productive human beings.

You will see the day, when the military has to step in, reorganizes people like Walmart and other food service providers, because they are causing so much lost productivity and chaos.
 
These companies like Walmart / Amazon have fucked the whole country absolutely to death.
Now it‚Äôs fucking themselves!

So now they are in a panic!

Instead of looking inward to figure out a way to improve the systems structure of their corporation, they got to find somebody else to FUCK..

That‚Äôs how grotesque Corporations think and operate.
Instead of sharing the profits of the corporation with the employees and vendors, they rape, rob, and steal until their is nothing left for anyone, not even themselves.

So the driverless trucks are their (Big Answer)

The Jesus Christ Superstar that comes to save them...

(Not)

That‚Äôs how delusional these fucking idiots are that are running our world.

We are in a war people!

Not just truckers, but all of you in a much worse bargaining position than us, because so many of the population are not able to do anything productive, or critically (THINK)

Before getting my masters in environmental engineering. I was someone who had a long history of temporary/seasonal jobs doing one of America's most common jobs. Cashier, housekeeping, manufacturing, food prep, shift supervisor, driver. I can honestly say they're all for the most part tiring, tedious and repetitious. I hated them all. Automate all the shitty jobs please :).

People need to understand, that the average truck driver is not a genius.  I'm not saying that to be condescending, but the job field does attract quite a bit of low intelligence individuals, primarily due to the simplicity of the field.  And with manual vehicles going out of style, the industry is able to now hire people that can drive without having to worry about all the shifting distractions.


I was a yard jockey and am currently a truck driver.  Quite low for how complex I like things, but the pay is really good.  Columbus Ohio is one of the hotbeds of trucking that pays extraordinarily well, something in the 60k to 80k ballpark.  However, not even I'm blind to the expansion of AI in trucking and let me tell you.  The transition of all trucks to automatic operation is NOT an issue of fuel economy.  To a small degree it is, but the primary factor here is automation, since you cannot have AI driving a stick shift.


Driving stick takes a bit more of intellectual capacity, but the breed is dying and soon they will soon be gone.  Many of the newer guys I trained with, could literally not understand the concept of a manual truck.  And the people they are hiring today (again to no offense) are very low on the totem pole.


So with that being said, if automated trucking takes over OTR (which would be the first implementation) you are going to permanently displace these kinds of people.  And with trucking being the most complex job they have ever managed to do, they will never be able to be re-integrated into a higher field of skill or pay.  What are those people going to do?


Some of us have degrees, military experience, other skill areas.  But I'm telling you, the automation of trucking would easily wipe out a good 90% of the workforce permanently.
#####
Yang is using people‚Äôs fears of being unemployed/under employed just like Trump did to get elected. He even admits that‚Äôs how trump got elected. Then he does the same thing scaring people so they elect him. ‚ÄúMen will say anything to get into Women‚Äôs panties‚Äù. Right he is in a lot of people‚Äôs figurative ‚Äúpanties‚Äù. By the way all candidates will promise anything to get elected.
#####
I like UBI, but Congress will not pass it. If it does pass, it will eventually lead to higher personal tax and ultimately bankrupt America. Yang needs to share his plan to create high paying jobs for the unemployed workers as a result of automation.
#####
So if automation going to wipe all the truck driving jobs out why is the projections for the next ten years for truck jobs are increasing ?
#####
Why not let them coexist just not let anymore people to get a class a listens

#####
Andrew is right about a lot of things, including regarding automation. The one thing I think he gets wrong is timing. All of his arguments rely on the timing being right, i.e. AI will take these jobs over soon. I think he's wrong on that, I think it will be a few decades before these jobs are fully automated and I think the world will have time to adjust. The pace of advancement in AI is overhyped by the media and people like Elon Musk. We're not there yet.

If we eliminate a lot of jobs via automation, wouldn't that cut out a lot of overhead and make things far cheaper across the board?
#####
Listen everyone, the automation revolution is *here* already. The 2 minor issues it faces are typical for most emerging technologies. 1 Not enough experts/easier to learn tools. 2 It's also quite expensive to design automated tech. Once it's cheap to do it easy, it's gonna be like flipping a switch, life as we know it will be shaken up overnight unless we prepare for it.

we will just be watching each other's videos, listening to each other's music in 20 years and thats it.

This is all bullshit to push communism, even with self driving cars the drivers will still have jobs, Its like with pilots its mostly controlled by a computer, just makes the job easier for the pilot. still have 2 pilots in every plane even though a computer does most of the work, just encase the computer malfunctions.

#####
Uhmm......I like free money.
#####
Antumation and AI will take more blue amd white color jobs. If it's more efficient business will do it. The best way to handle it is for the government to give free education to people in fields that will be going away soon such as trucking, coal miners.....and jobs we wont expect yet such as jobs in banking.
#####
YANG GANG
#####
Retraining is just unrealistic. Truckers are not going to become software or robotics engineers. Noether will nost retail workers or manufacturing workers. You migjt be able to retrain less than 10% of them. Also those fields will be flooded too.
#####
I think what would be smart for truckers to do is to start saving their money. Save as much as you can to buy an automated truck such as a Tesla Semi. For now you can drive it yourself, but then when the time comes for automation, and it likely will come, you can lease your truck to companies to do shipments for them. Passive income while you're sitting at home or working another job.
#####
Drivers will most likely become more of baby sitters than regular drivers over time. Possibly taking part in the fine detail maneuvers, road maintenance, and load/unload of products. Maintenance, tech, and trade work will continue to be viable. That said, we need systems in place to retrain people for the change in the job market. We can't forget people. Like what happened with the coal industry.
Otherwise, we will end up with another Trump, or something worse. That is hard to imagine, but it could happen if nothing changes.
#####
Here‚Äôs an idea.

Since automation will save money, improve this and that and what not. Why don‚Äôt we take the money that is saved and give the truck drivers an education for another job?

It doesn‚Äôt have to be a job that requires academic learning, it can be trades. The world NEEDS more tradesmen and tradeswomen anyway! Use the money to pay for them.

With this idea, you can get these drivers better jobs, jobs that are more fun and healthier. No one wants to drive for 12 hours, it‚Äôs unhealthy.

You can argue that many truck drivers old, so *at least* take out the young ones, or give these drivers and opportunity to ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù to leave their current job and get paid to go do something else!

That‚Äôs just my two cents.
#####
yes, balance it out. so people keep their jobs, while robots help
#####
"Should We Regulate Automation?" Same thing as saying Should we regulate progress...
#####
If both of these people are sitting across from each other, what‚Äôs the points of the head phones???
#####
If you gave everyone 1000 a month no matter what that would change real estate. People will move to places that are cheapest to live not places with opportunities. Everyone will flood away from metropolitan areas. Rent on major coastal cities are a third more expensive than inland cities and towns. $1000 will buy you a lot more in South Dakota than in New York.
#####
AI will take your job.  
Get over it and bow down you bitch
#####
I worked in an AI lab for a national-scale bank in Canada, my VP basically said that I was to figure out how to automate loan officers' jobs using basic technology (low-hanging fruit) to AI (things like Optical Character Recognition or Computer Vision for document verification). Don't think this is far away, whole departments (ranging from 30 to 50 people each) are doing basic tasks that pass off as doing a lot of work on the surface but once you tally up the numbers is not a lot of stuff done while being paid salaries that can be $50K. If you think white-collar automation is faraway, then you are wrong.
#####
Andrew Yang is clearly not ready. So he's perfect for America..

World government Artificial Intelligence   (automated "politician") - manage the country/world with social credit like china and you can't buy or sell without registering into the system with some kind of chip
#####
Yeah but what if you drive 1 Tesla and you have 2 semi autonomous Tesla trucks follow you? You get paid for 3 loads at once.
#####
Ok
Let's visualize this.. 

Imagine a spiders web..  
Put the big rig in the center.. 
Now think of everything that's required to support the truck and the driver...
Place it around the truck in the center.. 

What you are imagining is the very center of the web..  Zoom back a bit.. 

What's required to keep this truck profitable is what is used in everyone's lives at one point.. 

These products and services still requires basic human interaction..  

What's first considered is:
Fuel delivery
Dockworkers
Security staff
Plumbers,  HVAC techs and electricians 
Dispatchers
Sanitation workers (garbage men) 
Food delivery (medicine as well) 
Merchandising 

But it goes far beyond that.. 
There are thousands of truck stops in North America..  Probably millions.. 

Easily there are hundreds of people employed at one location working to keep it running and stocked..  

There are more people behind preparing the products to distribute.. 

There are even more people behind preparing and creating the products for these workers to  distribute.. 

He mentioned five million? More like a hundred million workers will feel the effects when this change happens.. 

Not just job loss because of cancelled contracts/layoffs..  Because complex automation will trickle into their companies and render them obsolete..  

Many of these small towns may become ghost towns.. 

It wil affect:
Restaurants
Healthcare
Transportation 
Retail
Legal
General Repair

All industries will increase effectiveness from enhanced automation..  How far will they take it? 

This newer automation may reduce workload but if left unchecked it could replace much of the blue and white collar jobs entirely.. 

$1000 is great but if there are no jobs or gigs available to me then what's the use? Can't live on that.. Even AI is learning to code..

we should automate regulation
#####
Yes, including AI and other things. There is a story in the Roman Empire they came to the Emperor and said we could move grain by water and cut the number of men and move more grain. The Emperor refused to use it because it would end a lot of jobs for honest Romans and freemen since carts moving grain was a big group of jobs the wagon makers and tending them, the men to drive, the people loading and unloading and the like. In fact I would move for an International Treaty to wind manufacturing back to 1970 levels any non-signee nations can't trade with those that do. Get China and India and the United State then other nations on board most other nations will need to follow or not be able to trade. But I would find the company bosses using the technology and smash heads in and if needed worse until terror causes them to not do it or force the government to act to protect their jobs.
#####
No. 

We can focus on other things.

Autonomous vehicles need to pay the taxpayers a subsidy. Per mile.

I can‚Äôt wait til we automate podcasts

A Tesla can‚Äôt keep itself in its lane on a clear day, how do expect a 30 ton truck to stay in its lane? And with wind, icy roads, etc.
#####
Anyone who thinks that the trucking industry is just going to abandon the billions of dollars invested in traditional equipment is out of their minds.  Many large trucking companies can't even handle billing/invoicing via EDI, let alone implement a self-driving truck program.  I know of multiple billion-dollar companies in the industry still storing mass amounts of data to tape.  There's also never been a period in history where innovation didn't create more jobs than it replaced.  As automation continues to happen, the workforce will begin to shift from engineer & operator to engineer & technician.  Trains drive themselves for the most part, but there's still two people on-board at all times.  the vast majority of flight time by commercial pilots is spent in auto-pilot.  Automation doesn't replace, it just reshapes.  This type of rhetoric is dangerous.  It promotes the same kind of lack of personal responsibility that the left is known for.  Be wary of the fear-tactics that are plaguing our political landscape.

Truckers will lose , the people that fix the trucks will lose, people that manufacture the vehicles to begin with will lose. The whole automotive industry is going to Implode within 15 years. People won't be needed to build, fix or drive any kind of new vehicle. Your main car dealerships will have 2 or three techs working just keeping an eye on the robots. The other 20-50 won't be required. 
Big grocery stores won't have people on the tills anymore as every item will scan itself on exit of the store, The shelves will be stacked by robots. Coffee shops won't need people, restaurants won't need people other than maybe the chef, eventually they will be replaced too. Places like phone shops and Apple stores don't need people, if your device is faulty you just place it on a tray, you'd type on a screen what is wrong, the tray has a scanner on it that wirelessly removes all of your data and puts it onto another phone, that phone rises on another tray next to your phone, you take the replacement and your old phone falls through a trap door to be taken away to a factory where a team of robots remove all the components then builds a new phone with the viable bits which then gets returned to the store for the next person. After that the store is closed down, when you get a problem you'd just ping the manufacturer who sends a drone to wherever you are and swaps your phone for a new one. No factory/manual worker is safe. After that it will be google, Microsoft, Facebook etc laying off all of it's workers, as A.I will just come up with all the new ideas and do all the programming. A.I can do it now to some level.  Then its gp's, why have a human there that you tell your issue to when you can just tell a robot which scans the biggest library of symptoms and issues available in a matter of seconds and can then prescribe a drug or treatment or refer you to see a specialist.   A.I and robots are going to change this world drastically.

Yang's response to improving education is on point! ‚ô•Ô∏èüòä. Vote for Yang!
#####
The fact that Andrew wants to include a life skills course in high school and champions the blue collar community really makes him one of the best candidates.
#####
In the first 10 seconds Andrew is declaring it's not right that teachers pay for school supplies for children out of their pocket.....then Andrew says.... he would pay the teachers more....?.... I'm confused... is it wrong that kids do not have the dedicated school supplies they need? Or that teachers need more money in their pocket so they can continually pay for school supplies for the kids?  Either way , he is not addressing the fundamental problem here..... kids are under prepared for the schooling they need.  Do teachers have to pay or is the state or feds going to give these kids what they need?.....and give teachers a bump in pay....
#####
This man is astounding. Bernie yielded to Hillary last time. Oh what a service he would be doing the world if he yielded to and got Andrew elected. He can look at Andrew as a 21st century Bernie

I'm voting for Yang too!

No one can argue with what Mr Yang says here. NO ONE!
#####
lol, how the fuck did you get an interview with yang?
#####
Sanders + Yang = Profit???

I‚Äôm sorry, I love Sanders, but Yang is the only candidate actually talking about these issues on a deep level. Yang will have my vote.

We should all like and comment to spread his videos to a wider audience!

I agree with you regarding vocational training & your POV on the current wacko emphasis that college is the end all, be all!
#####
all im saying 46/1 like ratio .  i think andrew is has such a good chance because they will always try to shut down bernie.
#####
my opinion, Yang is the only one who can challenge Sanders. I hope  they eventually work together. Sanders will fight for the worker and the common man, and Yang will equip us for a technological future. That will make America great again.

So you would deprive one person of their capital to provide another person with their capital?

No individual or group of individuals can predict the best path for humanity's future.

That future should be determined by the emergent outcomes of the choices made by every individual as they take actions based upon their own unique set of circumstances, their wants and their needs.

The human collective is an illusion.¬†

There is no evidence for russian bots, you can get away by staging chemical attacks in syria and that kind of crap but we europeans wont go to war with russia just because you re so fcking dumb your citezens dont even know their gender, its time for americans to come out of their bubble.

Soooo... declaring the war for a shitposting? Yeah, this guy seems reasonable (sarcasm).
#####
How will he stop usa from temperring other countries affairs?  

It is funny he wanted other countries to stop doing that, without mentioning how to stop usa doing what it has been doing for decades. 

Russia will not stop unless usa stop. Recently usa got caught hacking to russia power grid. What should russia do then?

After being exposed to his Foreign policy i can tell you 100 percent that if there will be involvement from Russia and China, it will be in his favor.

It‚Äôs all about the money and harvesting power. Corruption is in the eye of the beholder.  No matter what country and what ethnicity money trumps all.  Look at historical times.

#####
In all honesty Russian people influencing how Us voters act is to be expected in the age of the internet. It's all up to the American people to pick what they hear and how they use that information and vote. This isn't something to go to war with the Russian govt over.

We do have evidence that Russians are interfering with our elections

He is ignorant to think that Americans will go against Russia

yes he is another deep state scumbag riding their russophobia hate train because US is losing influence and nations like russia, china, india are becoming more powerful so this is their last breath before death. just try to cause economic problems and instigate conflicts. US is a pathetic country.

Thats a shallow dangerous idea. Create a spiral of conflict with a country whose nuclear force is that of a world power...all for something so insignificant in election outcomes. Create better defense, instead of acting like a cornered dog. I think I'm going to stop supporting you until you change this view. Too dangerous.
#####
0:45  "if you tamper with our system again, we will take that as an act of hostility and aggression..."   No you won't, you can't physically threaten Russia just like they can't physically threaten you - the stalemate exists there with both conventional and nuclear weapons - so the next thing you can do is trade sanctions, people get tired of that shit after a while, heaven forbid the U.S. ever loses it's control of being the world's most powerful country, if things ever go belly up, every country that the U.S. has created a trade embargo with will return the favor and the U.S. will be a very shitty place to live.
#####
It‚Äôs an act of hostility to post a meme? What a joker
#####
I love how the other videos of this podcast have many upvotes, while the one about the russian trolls getst he downvotes
#####
Wow so you talk about ‚ÄúRussian Trolls‚Äù but not the JIDF? What about the fact that the ADL gets to decide who gets censored on social media? Russia didn‚Äôt hack the election. Israel have meddled in every single U.S election for decades now.
#####
I'd like to know more specifics. What can we actually do to Russia to get them to behave? Sanctions? It sounded like he was hinting at something more significant.
#####
Is PBS not a good source of information???
#####
On economics, and on the crisis of meaning, Yang sounds very intelligent and well informed. His response here, however, is  that of a novice.  He talks like someone who gets his ideas about foreign policy and  "Russia hacked our election" from happening to have read a couple of poorly researched articles in the Washington Post or from listening to cable news.  

If given a fuller picture, he might come up with something more profound than what he has said here. As of now, I trust Tulsi Gabbard's instincts on foreign policy much more than this guy, or any other Democrat in the running.
#####
Want to protect American democracy?  Ensure only Americans are voting.  Only count Americans during the census to ensure electoral votes are for the American population only. Those are the 2 first steps.
#####
People here doubting troll farms. Of course there are troll farms! JFC, why WOULDN'T a country try to deepen division in a geopolitical rival? You don't have to buy the whole 'collusion' thing to see the benefit in posing as BLM to make Americans hate each other
#####
he should run for a cabinet position because his foriegn policy seems extremely weak. He seems like a 2020s robert reich type figure.

Holy fuck, this comment section is rife with bots.

#####
Russian trolls in these comments
#####
This is the first time I've ever heard Andrew Yang give a really mediocre answer. Even if I accept the argument that the Russians caused actual damage (the hopelessly bloated failure of an investigation was not their idea), there are three simple reasons why you can't just flex your muscles to make this go away:

1. Writing a script is legal in Russia and the US.
2. Voicing your opinion about an election is legal in Russia and the US.
3. Lying is legal in Russia and the US.
#####
He is the hope. He was an entrepreneur and knows how to develop middle class. US needs middle class.
#####
I don't know anyone whose vote was swayed by Russian Trolls. But I do know thousands of people who believed a whole bunch of fake news. The problem comes from within.
#####
Acknowledging that Russian interference is real; what could be a greater cause of erosion of truth to information: a polarized News medium within the United States. The principal outlets for information have picked their side on the political spectrum, and until, if ever, this can be resolved, what interference the Russians, China, or any other capable country can introduce, is almost moot. Social media platforms are ubiquitous, but no more so than the likes of MSNBC, CNN, FOX, CBS, etc., etc. and they are finding an easy scapegoat by blaming RUSSIA for now! Basically, the problem  is more internal, than external!
#####
This is a perfect example of when Rogan talks about how people who have never been in a fight talk......All tough huh?  You are going to tell Russia whats up, then do what?   Go to war over a twitter campaign?  This is a good example of someone who has oversimplified his worldview and hasn't ever taken a metaphorical punch to the face.  He doesn't understand real violence.
#####
Wow, finally a politician who is honest, deals with a comprehensive set of facts, sees the patterns in them, has a moral compass, knows what he is talking about, has the foresight to talk about problems in the near future and the intelligence to deal with them. Isn't that exactly what a leader should be?


People like Trump are just afraid of the future and seem to be pointing backwards, don't seem to have any foresight in the ways our world changes so radically and quickly and are just sticking their heads in the sand to not have to deal with it. You can't stop the progress of technology, you have to anticipate it.
#####
sounds resonable

What makes this guy think as president he would have any clue what the CIA is doing, let alone be able to stop them from doing it. ( A person that's been working for the CiA for 20 yrs has to figure out how to outsmart the guy whos been in office for a few days). What he says about technology is true but those crooks in Washington would spend billions of dollars to convince people otherwise if that's what was required for one of their own to get elected.

Craigslist what? CL is dead bro . . .whatever, im going back to not voting at all.  The last time I voted the dude lied about tax breaks and tried to force america to pay for some stupid ass wall.

Anybody else notice that yang did not answer the question?

Meanwhile, in the JRE comments section: "So you're telling me this Chinese spy thinks he is going to be president? And he's going to declare war on Russia because of troll farms that definitely dont exist? You're really a sellout, Joe"
#####
The same guy who said something to the effect of, the Democratic party is the best hope of the future of America...really...it's a dying party made up of identity politics and the WORST kind of economic policies.  They are the ENEMY of prosperity and a friend to complete government dependence not independence.  The democrats best hope of winning a presidential election is someone non white or transgender, both if possible because it's all identity politics all the time and the only way to tax the shit out of people with permission is to expand government control and power in the name of racism and sexism or saving the earth with trusting the government with your money.  Fuck this guy and anyone who votes for him because "he speaks nice and sounds reasonable".

All news papers need to be done on local levels to become more viable. National papers just don‚Äôt work anymore, they‚Äôre too political & filled with opinions instead of news. All business centers in every neighborhood could be centered around schools & universities.
#####
I'd like to hear him list even one tangible thing that Russian interference has cost us other than just throwing out an arbitrary, baseless number in the billions.
#####
I feel like this will only make everyone ticked off at us... Because EVERYONE influences each other in some way or other. Is he going to ban BBC or any other news organization world wide from showing any content in the US? All of these articles or videos are "influencing" Americans and their view on politics... It would be better to just limit it to our adversaries at the most, but I would prefer it not be anyone since that would put the onus on the listener/reader/viewer to THINK maybe (if we would ever decide to teach people skepticism in school instead of regurgitation).
#####
So we have freedom of speech, unless you are a "Russian bot"??? I didn't see any robots at the polls when I voted. Left wing media controlled lies are somehow ok but internet bots are a cause to start a war? I love that he admits that we influenced other countries elections for decades, but now that it happened to us (in his opinion), now we are ready for a war. So glad this clown will never even grace a ballot in front of me.

Hey Joe, there is much more evidence of Israeli influence in U.S. elections, have you covered that yet?

This is where he spoils it. "If we have any credible evidence....." that is evidence he won't know a DAMN thing about vetting his military intelligence, his defense department or arms of the state department like National Endowment for democracy. Easy to see why Harris likes this guy.

Yang has stated that his plan for "Pathway to Citizenship" will not go into effect until after the southern border is secured and criminals stop coming in.
#####
...Andrew Yang has created a Dizzying list of more than 100+ policies !!!!,....and the number is growing and growing....hundreds by 2020....? ; among those policies are medicare for all, the UBI, the paid family leave, $100 vouchers for all Americans to donate to nonprofits, reviving earmarks to make bills easier to pass, hiring a White House psychologist, legal marijuana, geoengineering to fight global warming, etc ...etc....etc...some of his policies seem to be grounded in Math. and data.... 
Andrew Yang began his Presidential Campaign on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic Primaries. Yang says his campaign is about facts, solutions, and people....but the real fact is that ...after "18 months" of Presidential Campaign....!, his great Town Halls, interviews, rallies, speeches, after so much Media attention, there is no doubt Yang has become a very well known presidential candidate these days...but now on May 2019, he averages "only" 0 to 1 percent in Nationwide Public Opinion Polls.... 
Andrew Yang has no shortage of things to talk about, he dreams Big !!!!....but Political History, Reality, and Pragmatism have always shown us that Math. and good intentions not always give such a huge number of ideas and policies the chance of being carried out and accomplished successfully for so many reasons.... they become very often a fiction novel, not a real platform.....

..." Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be "...... ( A. Einstein ).

Congrats you came illegally and skipped the rest...here citizenship. Yeah fuck that noise.
#####
You lost my vote. Illegal immigrants need to be sent home. They are breaking the law every day that they are here.
#####
We need to deport these people. California is already overpopulated and has more homeless than any other state. The USA is severely overpopulated and can't accept more people.
#####
I don't like the idea of a path to citizenship unless it only applies to illegals who have been living in the county and paying taxes for an extended amount of time. Otherwise it would create a serious incentive for illegal entry.
#####
IF THIS GUY IS NOT PRESIDENT IM GOING TO LOSE MY SHIT CNN CRITICISM OF HIM IS SO UNJUST SPREAD THE WORD PPL
#####
Like the international student policy, I would like to know if he's against illegal immigration, but all he said was enforce the Southern border and attracting talented immigrants, so I hope he is. I think we should also address the issue of bringing in huge groups of a culture which usually creates conflict with the existing culture. We want to make sure we can assimilate immigrants, which requires us to enforce the border, bringing in many poor people that don't speak english isn't exactly an advantage for the country.
#####
Crap, hire vets to deport them, they cost $20,000,000,000 each month, they do not contribute. If they get a degree, go back and help your country. Dump Yang
#####
They truly deserve a path to citizenship provided  they have not done a felony crime in the country.
#####
Alla M, I think Andrew is talking about those illegal immigrants who are actively employed and are part of our economy, holding jobs and actually paying taxes although some of them paying to SS of other people sometimes dead people. Homeless people are a different problem .
#####
On one hand he says we need to slow down the pace of automation so people don't lose jobs. And on the other he wants to incentivize more people to come here illegally and have children, witch will create more competition for American workers.
#####
He said...a whole lot of nothing.
#####
as an american i think its important to have strong immigration policy to protect our economy. but on the other hand i wish i could move to europe because i just hate living here so much. but college is to expensive for me so no country would take  my worthless ass because im unskilled labor. also im a proud white man
#####
I was supporting Bernie Sanders.But this guy is much better and I only found out about him now. And his views on immigration are better than Bernie's.
#####
Andrew i gonna make all illegals in the country citizens yang.
#####
He expands on this more on Rogans podcast: 
https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=4699
#####
Seriously if automation is taking over jobs then we don't need these illegal Aliens anymore therefore there is no need for path to citizenship for them....Yang say this to appeal less anti-immigration to his base.  If he's going to offer UBI for these illegals he'll just make things worse.  I was all for this guy but apparently he's not Americans first then again he's a democrat so i'm not surprise.
#####
Yang would give Trump a tough fight but people and YouTube videos say that trump would be victorious over yang well barely so they say.
#####
Why is he holding the mic like that?
#####
not interested
#####
Andrew, I welcome your voice in the political process, but you're wrong on this.  "Path to citizenship"?  Don't we have enough tent cities?  Don't we have enough unemployed people?  Why swamp our labor markets even more with these people?  I don't think you really thought this through.
#####
What's.......  what's
#####
I will suicide bomb myself if Andrew yang doesn't make it.
#####
Oh c'mon... where is Andrew Yang ?? He is caring and decent and has the solutions to all of the problems in America ! Yang  2020.

Julian Casablancas' report is obviously very important, as was his ancestral  position in society. 

Russia has "ownership" of Japan as a new "Karluks", refer to previous posts. Japan takes the fall for Russia when assigned. Including the 19th century investigation... And WWI?

Germany was not under "ownership" like the newly founded Japan as of 1 AD, but Germany had been "Karluked".  Germany would feign fault via propaganda to cover for Russia's actual wrongdoing.

The concentration camps covered for the Russian Science Universities opened in the 18th century. The secret wing hosted the beginning of extreme Russian Science and human experiments.

Joseph II of Austria was still angelic. Contributing to the University under the umbrella of Enlightenment was THE factor for his later  "punishment", leading to the hanging of Justice Hugo Black. The dog of Hugo Black had to figure out what seemed like a distress repelling involvement which was barely perceivable and not at all to humans; animal experiments. Thus the murder of Hugo Black's dog.

The truth was unearthed. The bloodlines of Polita Barnes and Vladimir Putin, founders of the Karluk settlement and falsely founded Dominion of Russia, had a unique, small specialized way for an Indian Settlement. But they failed to figure things out properly before incarnating. Their pride could be volatile if imbalanced and cause a chain reaction that exceeded their growth patterns. Learning what had happened to themselves only inspired them to use the ideas of growth patterns and imbalance to "screw over" their targets via patterning for their master plan. The quintessential "Mad Scientists", "Evil Rulers", "Public Super Villains".

I disliked this video the moment I realized TIME was not going to mention Andrew Yang. 
In this Trump era of politics how are you going to ignore the highly intelligent, forward thinking, progressive candidate that is a political outsider who was the FIRST to qualify for the DNC debates, and a candidate who isn‚Äôt afraid to speak on conservative platforms? How do you simply ignore that and his enormous internet following #YangGang? 

I‚Äôm disappointed TIME, but you can make up for it by giving Andrew an entire segment. #Yang2020 don‚Äôt be influenced by the misrepresentations, go to Yang2020.com and make your own decisions.

NO MORE LAW BREAKING LAWYERS running to "represent" every day people. We won't elect them. It doesn't work. Everyone hates lawyers anyway because they naturally waste others' time and money and are in it for themselves. Democrats had their chance and did nothing but make things worse.

Where‚Äôs Wald- I mean.. where‚Äôs Andrew Yang!?

I so far like Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Gabbard, and Sanders. I would prefer one of them but Sanders cause I feel we don't need to swing from extreme conservative to extreme liberal. I think the others are gonna manage well. Maybe Booker less than the others for the reason I just stated. But I like that's he's African American and not foreign black (no offense intended...but I believe this country needs African American and Indigenous leaders before those voices fall back into repression).

the first 102 comments talk about nothing but #YANGANG and about him not being there. wow.

idk who i want for president but i just hope whoever becomes president will do a good job and actually be able to fix things and not make it worse. im not gonna vote for someone just because theyre black, female, or gay. i'll vote for a rich white male republican if i think he seems like he could do the best. thats what ppl need to be doing. actually voting for what that person stands for and plans to do and what type of person they r. ive learned my lesson. i mean, obama and hilary clinton on got top place when they ran for president because they were a woman and a black guy.

*Joe Biden is full of crap. He said he enjoyed 8 years of ZERO scandals with Obama. . IRS targets Obama‚Äôs enemies:¬†The IRS targeted conservative and pro-Israel groups prior to the 2012 election. Questions are being raised about why this occurred, who ordered it, whether there was any White House involvement and whether there was an initial effort to hide who knew about the targeting and when.2.¬†Benghazi:¬†This is actually three scandals in one: The failure of administration to protect the Benghazi mission; the changes made to the talking points in order to suggest the attack was motivated by an anti-Muslim video; and the refusal of the White House to say what President¬†Obama¬†did the night of the attack.3. Keeping an eye on¬†The Associated Press:¬†The Justice Department performed a massive cull of Associated Press reporters‚Äô phone records as part of a leak investigation.¬† 4. Rosengate:¬†The Justice Department suggested that¬†Fox News¬†reporter James Rosen is a criminal for reporting about classified information and subsequently monitored his phones and emails.5. Potential Holder perjury I:¬†Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress he had never been associated with ‚Äúpotential prosecution‚Äù of a journalist for perjury when in fact he signed the affidavit that termed Rosen a potential criminal.6. The ATF ‚ÄúFast and Furious‚Äù scheme:¬†Federal agencies allowed weapons from U.S. gun dealers to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù across the border into the hands of Mexican drug dealers. The ATF summarily lost track of scores of those weapons, many of which were used in crimes, including the December 2010 killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.7. Potential Holder perjury II:¬†Holder told Congress in May 2011 that he had just recently heard about the Fast and Furious gun walking scheme when there is evidence he may have known much earlier.8. Sebelius demands payment:¬†HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius solicited donations from companies HHS might regulate. The money would be used to help her sign up uninsured Americans for Obamacare.9. The Pigford scandal:¬†An Agriculture Department effort that started as an attempt to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency but evolved into a gravy train delivering several billion dollars in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who probably didn‚Äôt face discrimination.10. GSA gone wild:¬†The¬†General Services Administration¬†in 2010 held an $823,000 training conference in Las Vegas, featuring a clown and a mind readers. Resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator.11. Veterans Affairs in Disney World:¬†The agency wasted more than $6 million on two conferences in Orlando. An assistant secretary was fired.12. Sebelius violates the Hatch Act:¬†A U.S. special counsel determined that Sebelius violated the Hatch Act when she made ‚Äúextemporaneous partisan remarks‚Äù during a speech in her official capacity last year. During the remarks, Sebelius called for the election of the Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina.13. Solyndra:¬†Republicans charged the Obama Administration funded and promoted its poster boy for green energy despite warning signs the company was headed for bankruptcy. The administration also allegedly pressed Solyndra to delay layoff announcements until after the 2010 midterm elections.14. AKA Lisa Jackson:¬†Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used the name ‚ÄúRichard Windsor‚Äù when corresponding by email with other government officials, drawing charges she was trying to evade scrutiny.15. The New Black Panthers:¬†The Justice Department was accused of using a racial double standard in failing to pursue a voter intimidation case against Black Panthers who appeared to be menacing voters at a polling place in 2008 in Philadelphia.16. Waging war all by myself:¬†Obama may have violated the Constitution and both the letter and the spirit of the War Powers Resolution by attacking Libya without Congressional approval.17. Biden bullies the press:¬†Vice President Biden‚Äôs office has repeatedly interfered with coverage, including forcing a reporter to wait in a closet, making a reporter delete photos, and editing pool reports.18. AKPD not A-OK:¬†The administration paid millions to the former firm of then-White House adviser David Axelrod, AKPD Message and Media, to promote passage of Obamacare. Some questioned whether the firm was hired to help pay Axelrod $2 million AKPD owed him.19. Sestak, we‚Äôll take care of you:¬†Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used Bill Clinton as an intermediary to probe whether former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.) would accept a prominent, unpaid White House advisory position in exchange for dropping out of the 2010 primary against former Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).20. I‚Äôll pass my own laws:¬†Obama has repeatedly been accused of making end runs around Congress by deciding which laws to enforce, including the decision not to deport illegal immigrants who may have been allowed to stay in the United States had Congress passed the ‚ÄúDream Act.‚Äù

College should be affordable for EVERYONE, not just the elites. A college degree may not be necessary for everyone, but it does open doors to certain careers that require a college degree. It's not even about whether or not a person can land a high paying job without a college degree (I know that some can and are perfectly happy), it's about enabling people to be able to pursue whatever career they want, a right that only the rich seem to have now given how expensive college is. I agree with you Mike! I wish more people in the comments section did too.
#####
Yanggang came down hard on this vid, huh?
#####
to be fair, the h1b visa demonstrates the people of usa(with extremely few, very notable exceptions) have no business going to college....leave college to us....you just keep on doing the grunt work.
#####
I see the YangGangBangers have bombarded the dislike button on this video clip!
#####
Many people expect him to be super left but yang not. That‚Äôs why he says he not left or right it‚Äôs forward. In a way I am scared if he try to give too much free this or that taxes are going to up more in California. I like that he wants to control school tuition like Jill Stein suggested in 2017. It‚Äôs honestly a waste of money to give someone a seat to a college or university to people who don‚Äôt want to be their. My brother threw away a year of school and did not even try when someone else could have taken his spot and the money would have been used better to give to students who really need it.
#####
The way I see it:
Free college = People have no choice but to pay for it with their taxes
Affordable college = People have a choice to pay or not pay for it
#####
Free college is like:  College institutions lobby with the government - College secretly raises significant prices each year - Government pays them higher and higher fees due to free college - Government takes the money from public to pay - College institutions get richer and richer = ends up money flowing into a handful of rich beneficiaries.  Yang's proposal, money goes to the people...gives power back to the people....
#####
Sorry man, you‚Äôre 100% wrong in this video....
#####
@Mike
You are missing so much more, because Yang's $1000. does not work for people living in poverty or the disabled, which I am below the poverty line at 61 after 2008. I had a stroke last year and I am not disabled enough to get disabled and I can work part time, but not full time. But either way, Yang would screw me.
You see, the 1000 is in place of welfare programs like the food stamps that I need and my 10.00 a month in HIP healthcare, which saved my life and didn't leave me in debt filing bankruptcy.
Yang's proposal only works for people above the poverty line and the wealthy.
Really dive into how Yang's 1000 works by reading his website.
BERNIE SANDERS 2020.
#####
I was pretty interested in Yang up until this information. I think we should go step by step towards radicalism, and free college is less radical than UBI. US student debt is second to none, it's embarrassing. Whereas UBI hasn't even been properly implemented anywhere yet. It's like jumping to use kelvins for temperature when we barely use the metric system.
#####
No dude - college, in its present form, is mostly a giant F'n con-job. Stop schilling. Yang doesn't support the wildly overpriced private products that the public is FORCED to pay for. See HEALTH CARE SCAM - ROMNEY CARE / OBAMA CARE> Under the guise of humanitarianism they con you.
#####
Lol found a Bernie nut, 1000 a month WOULD give you the choice to go to college, yeah maybe you wouldnt be able to go to harvard or USC or stanford on 12000 a year, but it sure as would let you go to a community college for 2 years and save that money you dont spend to help go to a 4 year when you're done. Seems like you're too stuck on pushing Bernies policies that you must find anyway to dislike yangs ideas. Watch more of how he discusses these issues befire you disagree with him
#####
College education is useless now, you can learn anything you can in college online if you want to, 90% of people who come out of college are still horribly undereducated
#####
You don't have to go to collage to get educated. Read books, where you think everybody learns from. Education hes one of the best parts, look what hes proposing for schools. Collage is not the problem, the real problem is our education system. I'm know more things and I'm more successful than most of my friends and is not because I'm more intelligent, is because I reed everything, they just read what was given to them. And hes not saying that is not important, he is just saying there are other ways. Hes campaign is around looking to the future and changing the way we think about work.
#####
Yang is right.  Instead of funding schools,  people get their UBI and they can have the freedom to choose how to better themselves.   Open up a business,  go into trades (plumbing etc.)
#####
I don't think college is valuable by itself. I think it's there to get an education for the kind of occupation that an individual wants. $1000 a month would help and it sounds as if Yang will still fight to lower the costs anyways. Plus if you want to be a more knowledgeable person if you have access to the internet, an open mind, and you check your sources, that could be an education in itself (definitely not college though).  I think Yang is looking at what the next generation is going to need to learn and it seems he thinks that the next generation will have a lot more entrepreneurs and I don't disagree. With access to the internet building a business can be extremely easy (apparently, still trying myself tbh) so basically I think Yang is the right choice even if he doesn't believe free college is the answer (but I mean we could probably pay for it if his value tax was high enough)
#####
Why would you go to college and have debt when UBI can save up for it. This guy clearly born with a silver spoon.
#####
The people have spoken.  You are off the mark yo. #YangGang
#####
They ought to simply cut out all of the general education courses from degree programs and allow student's to jump right into their desired majors rather than taking high school classes all over again. This would drastically reduce the cost of college because the time it would take to achieve each degree would be nearly halved. A Bachelor's would only take about two years, a Master's 4 years, and a Doctorate 6 years. I can't help but think a system like that would create happier students and wiser workers.
#####
People can learn in many environments other than college. Libraries still exist. Communities just need to be stimulated at their base so that their is a little more hope in the average person‚Äôs life.
#####
The problem with modern college is the indoctrination of "social justice" rhetoric and thinking its the end all be all. My father was in the army for 20 years and has solid financial footing and amazing life experiences in about 12 countries. He was a dumb jock in high school who would have failed college. Why send him to college? It's not for everyone and Yang is right.
#####
Is American college that great? You know how many people squander it? 44% don‚Äôt pass. We can chalk it up to financial or personal reasons, but we can also look at the 56% who graduate and see people who regret it despite not having any additional financial or personal burdens. A substantial amount of people just see it as a waste of their time. I did. I don‚Äôt have student loan debt, I got scholarships and good grades. And I just hated the work. So boom, 5 years of my life spent trying to find myself and better myself and I regret it. Because I know, given the effort I put in, that I could have done all of it without a university. At least if you go to a trade school or something, it‚Äôs done much faster. Germany has free tuition and a lot of people in trades. So maybe the answer isn‚Äôt free college, but a change in our culture, as Yang suggests.
#####
Seems bias, since I'm sure you've racked up college debt and want the politics to be in your favor. But how does that help the rest of the American people?
#####
To say college isn‚Äôt to land a job it‚Äôs to get an education is being completely ignorant. Ask anyone why there in college... is to forward yourself in value to receive a higher paying job. You are completely out of touch in YANGs campaign and reasoning.
#####
So it seems like u don‚Äôt like YANGs answer cuz it‚Äôs too right sided?? You only like leftist answers? Administrators to student count have gotten larger, if poorer people wana go to college; the first 2 years will be even more affordable? Sorry but ur wrong and his answer is completely characteristic of his own because it‚Äôs REALISTIC!
#####
Yang 2020, please everyone, please just go listen to him and educate yourself on him. I don't expect anyone to agree but I have faith in our country to vote for him if we can spread awareness.
#####
My daughter's could easily afford college tuition without loans, with #FreedomDividend and working for me during the summer.   I pay 25/hr exterior painting, they learn whatever they want and gain a trade skill.
#####
Okay argument made, but still agree with Yang‚Äôs plan as more beneficial. The cost of college would go down, and people would go there, while more of us find it more beneficial to take different paths. College isn‚Äôt for everyone, nor is it the only way to educate people. 
The logic used in this video can be used to ask ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we teach these things at earlier stages of education, like high school?‚Äù in which case you need to evaluate the core issues of our educational system.. which Yang has addressed more than once.
Making college more affordable to decrease the debt burden, but still give us the responsibility of paying for college (because it is a willing choice to go) is valid. Make it so we can pay for it without struggling for years and years to come. The least we can do is pay our fair share in the choice to gain college education.

And having an addition $1000 per month on top of your job/career income CERTAINLY makes it easier to take care of student loan payments.
#####
Your opinion is far from impartial.  

The fact remains that nearly all information can be access online for free and that includes college curriculums, it means colleges value to cost ratio is criminal.
#####
I agree with yang
#####
Bernie‚Äôs solutions are so last century. üôÑ #yang2020
#####
Why is he assuming that people need college to fully develop
#####
if that's his one fault, still better than most of the centrist candidates in the stadium. Also, his rationale kind of makes sense, But I agree with Yangs purpose for higher education, it is a means to get a job.
#####
He understands how much more of an impact automation will make than earning a college degree.
#####
College does not make You smarter
#####
It's strange that you say that Yang comes from the business world and not from academia because Yang is a double Ivy Leaguer, his father has a PhD. his mother has a masters and his brother is a college professor.  So Yang knows the importance of education.
What you are saying is that a someone can not grow as a person in a 2 year college or vocational school but only at a 4 year college.  I must say that I only started to grow as a person when I started to work and not while attending college.  68% of the US population do not have college degrees so are you saying they did not grow as individuals.  So 4 year college is not only place you can grow as an individual.
Yang himself had a $100k college loan so he understands about student loans.
Yang is saying that college is not the only path for people and that there are other paths.
#####
No he doesn't,he has a really great plan for college! He has a 10x 10 plan After listening to Andrew on  Rogan,I switched from BERNIE to Yang... especially after I read his book: The War on Normal People ! There are other ways to educate yourself!....READ!!  THE MATH YANG does on education makes good sense as those jobs  won't be available as soon as AI hits us ! But by all means it won't hurt to get educated.It is criminal when post graduate students work as bartistas!
#####
The guy doesn't even know what community college actually is.  It's not merely a cheaper alternative to an Ivy league university, it serves a very different purpose as do trade schools.
#####
"College in and of itself is valuable." This is the silliest thing I've heard all week. As an example: I live in NYC and work in finance with no college degree (which is nearly impossible "in and of itself"), and I often quiz economics grads about BASIC financial functions (such as "describe the basic way a hedge fund effects the broader economy") and get blank stares.
#####
andrew yang has discuss education as far as a decade ago, and his pointed out how basically the education system is flawed. pumping money into a flawed system does not make it flawless, it only make the problem worst.  to be precise, yang pointed out that american are increasing studying finance and other profession that are "safe" that the way the education system is structure, undermines youth pursuiting startup and entrepreneurship. in short he want to shape the education system to create people more like him, and once you understand this, his education view make sense. you can agree or disagree with that, but he has a reason for opposing the education system as it stands because he see it as enriching the rich and pushing talent into finance and law that doesn't help benefit society as a whole.
#####
The host is trying to make the point that college should be required because it is not only about preparing students to be employable, but it is about educating a general populace about collective society so that we can have a functioning democracy which goes way back to the roots of democracy. Growing up though, my high school took on lots of these objectives (philosophy, bridging the gap between US and World History/Literature, foreign languages, etc.) so why is attending an expensive institution the only way to achieve a liberal arts education? Totally bogus argument.
#####
The biggest problem with free college is that it assumes everyone must go to college. This is simply not true. Free college = working class subsidizing the latte liberals of the left.
#####
Here‚Äôs why! Because he can‚Äôt just give everything for everyone for free. He is already offering a ton of stuff for free. Where will this money come from?
#####
He does not promote free college because many people who graduate from college don‚Äôt even get jobs in their area of study. We are over prescribing universities to people. There are jobs to meet the demand. We need to be investing in training programs.
#####
I agree with Yang. I don‚Äôt have a college education, but a great curiosity and open mindedness. I inform and educate myself constantly. Learning new languages. Developing new practical abilities, like care giving, gardening, cooking DIY technical stuff around the house, like painting little electrical or plumbing repairs. People learn many things just harnessing their will to be better day by day.
#####
Wouldn't the UBI decrease debt? Financial aid could still be used but people would eventually be able to pay it off so colleges would still technically be free even though they wouldn't really be free
#####
Yang wants everyone to get 1000 dollars AND get collage cheaper. This is doable in real politic world and a good thing. Free collage for all is not doable in real politic world, so its pretty pointless to argue about.
#####
I think Bernie Sanders is lacking on the universal basic income idea and I think Andrew Yang is lacking on the free college for all idea.

Personally I think both ideas are great if only we had two amazing candidates who are willing to sit down and listen to each other... oh yeah we do.

Personally if college is made free and Bernie removes student debt like he says he's going to which I believe I would like to personally go back to college go to art School get my degree in animation.
#####
Yeah your opinion on college is trash.


Nothing is free
#####
I disagree with you. You want to take American taxpayer money to pay for YOUR education.. No. That is unfair to people who choose not to attend colleges and do not believe in it. That is why Yang is proposing UBI, use your UBI to pay for college. It is your choice. I have confident Yang will bring college cost down at an affordable rate either with administrative bloat or gov funding. Children have the choice to attend college or start their own business.
#####
4:35 To justify anything by its so called ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù means it‚Äôs really quite worthless and that you‚Äôre out of ideas. People pay $60k/year to attend college, because they want the career ahead of them. If colleges are failing to deliver on that end (ever rising under employment), then we should focus on other more efficient means of delivering a productive skill to the people.
#####
Forgive all existing student loan debt, fully fund higher education/ trade and vocational schools so the loan debt crisis never happens again.  Problem solved.  Any lesser proposal is not only not a good idea, there‚Äôs absolutely no political advantage to supporting anything lesser because both have equal chance of passing through the senate.
#####
MikeFigueredo: This is one of your best videos ever, because Andrew Yang is a great candidate, but you broke down Andrew Yang's p.o.v. on college education and convinced me that is problematic, even though I think his overall view on education is pretty good. Well done.
#####
lets push him to change his mind.
#####
I agree with Yang. I would like to see college and universities affordable and "debt free" but not free. Like you can pay for it all with work study money.

And community college and vocational training should be super cheap but not free.
#####
The cost for a community college is NOT affordable. It's affordable in comparison to a university. But make no mistake. They're both very expensive.
#####
Well Yang is looking at the success rate of people who attended college, it's such a large portion of individuals that do not complete college after attending. So he believes that 1k a month would be able to assist many others who would like to attend. Making free wouldn't solve the problem of automation and the low unemployment rate. The over 1 Trillion in student debt burdens the last couple generations is preventing many from progressing in society.
#####
We don't have infinite money so we can't have it all.  If you give everyone $1,000 a month, then a college student who doesn't work will get $48k over 4 years which will go a long way to paying for school.
#####
4 year institutions should not be free. Community colleges should be free. Funded by the state for every child, just like they do at my vocational high school that has almost 4 thousand students and they are slowing starting to put in community colleges for people who need government assistance. I don‚Äôt think anyone would mind a tax hike for free community college
#####
No. No. No. No. No! I absolutely detest the idea of simply ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù student loans. I took out 40K in student loans and paid them off. If the government forgives student loans, do I get a damn refund? Use your damn brain. Policies that give one group of people something and another group of people nothing are terrible politically. Yangs policies incorporate ALL Americans. Bring the cost of college down and there‚Äôs no longer a need for enormous loans. That‚Äôs the root cause here. 
FUCKING LUNACY.
#####
‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs what other countries are doing‚Äù is a terrible argument. College in other countries is significantly less expensive with costs that are easier to manage. Bring the cost of college down first, then let‚Äôs talk about taxpayer funding. Saying ‚Äúfree college‚Äù without controlling the administrative spending is a damn band aid over a gaping wound.
#####
US colleges already are making millions with their sport teams so I maybe it is a good thing they should use that money on lowering intuitions and reducing some other costs. I get that college isn't a wonderstory like it used to be, but there are still loads of professions where you need a degree and for example med school. If you lower to cost then the the doctor wouldn't be as wage driven and could focus more on helping others (for example a more rurale place). And just for people to enjoy their 1000 a month since student debt collectors already have a reputation I wonder how much a person can enjoy their 1000 a month if they've got student debt.
#####
Andrew's gone on record saying that if you bring him an opinion and some data backing it, he would be ok with changing his mind.  So my suggestion would be to send a letter with a petition, or attend one of his rally's.  
Also I'll point out that 12000 extra per year would do wonders in relieving some educational costs.
#####
5:31 Literally all the information that they teach you in college (at least in undergrad) can be accessed on the internet for free, or a very tiny fraction of the price of college. It kind of makes me wonder why college is so expensive to begin with, regardless of who is paying for it.
#####
I am in college as a molecular biology major, and close to graduating. When enrolling, I was under the impression that I would get experience of some sort by being there. Instead, a lot of my classes involved sitting in a movie theater while listening to a professor talk while the rest of the class slept or was goofing off on their electronic devices. It might just be me, but that doesn't seem like the kind of thing that makes you "more competitive on the international job market." Not only that, but I was forced to take a bunch of general ed classes that had absolutely nothing to do with my interests, and that had course content that I could have learned with a quick google search for FREE.
#####
No, if you want tot educate the populist put money into k-12 public education and give people a learning foundation. Throwing money at these colleges will not help educate he populist because no one goes to college just to get smart. They go to get a higher paying job. If people want to get smarter they should go to the library on use the internet.
#####
I agree with Yang. He is giving you an option to choose the type of education you prefer and the ability to run a business with UBI. Subsidising colleges does not give you that option.
#####
Great video, I'd love to see more progressives engaging with Yang's arguments.
I'm curious what your thoughts are on his point that universities have taken up greater costs due to administrative increase. Do you think these expenses are justified, or should be decreased?
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/higher-ed-administrators-growth_n_4738584
#####
From my point view, I don't like free college for all, because not every one want to go to collage, then the society just chose to benefit  people with higher IQ more, I don't think it is fair, if free collage is the way to go, we should make skill schools, cooking school or any kind of education for the same age group for free as well. That is my option, UBI is better and just more fair. But the collage fees are just unacceptable now, make AY can take some ideas from Europe, some European countries college is not for free, but it is like 1000  -  5000 Euro per semester, it is just mainly administration fee, the state pay the professors, the students pay for the facility. I think that is fair.
#####
Because only 44% graduate and people that graduated will do job that does not required a college degree, I agree with Andrew Yang.  Free College only help 44% why in the world people want to put 100% into it....? If college is free, the graduation rate might be like 30% or lower.  I like Andrew Yang plans better....spend more on Technical College is the right move.
#####
What about subsidizing trade schools? Have someone become an apprentice and journeyman and learn a trade. Then use that money earned to save to pay for college. I agree that education is important, and I want a degree. But not for getting a job, as I would already have one.
#####
Yes! More yang exposure!!!
#####
You got all this wrong
#####
Fuck college. You can educate yourself. College is a joke to make people rich
#####
Progressives want free college forced leftist socialist snowflakes race identity  indoctrination
#####
College grads expect to come out of school make 150 grand. Laughable
#####
Screw you dumbass. I took loans and paid off college debt and your generation wants everything free. Go back Honduras you stupidcass
#####
Free college and $15 doesn't fix anything. Congrats with your free education, you still don't have a job or money and since it's free, there will be more competition in the job market.  Also $15 minimum wage isn't life changing. Jobs will cut your hours and in the end, you're still probably gonna need that second job and work 50+ hours make a living. Why set yourself up to work longer to make what you've been making before with a single job? I'll take that UBI. Work smarter, not harder. People can ask we don't just move somewhere cheaper, because it costs money and you can't save money for a deposits and 1st month rent somewhere else when you're just barely getting by at the moment, at least with the $1000 people won't feel trapped. The states with cheaper housing and less money will benefit because people will have the money to actually pick up and move there AND start business and increase the economy. Also what exactly is your argument for college? Life experience? Not everybody experiences college the same way and quite honestly college seems to stunt young people from actually transitioning into adulthood since it's almost like a delay on facing reality.
#####
Of course you will disagree! Otherwise you will be admitting that you wasted your life and money so far! LOL
Every single rich, successful smart entrepreneur person, will tell you the same. So let me pop your bubble! 
College is not everything, and you don't need college to be successful in life, The same way kids think that highschool is everything until they go to college, once you graduate from college you will face the hard truth of life.
#####
Education is valuable but I see nothing wrong with seeing it as a utility in seeking a job or career. $12k a year would help you pay for your CC if you choose to spend it that way. 
I‚Äôd rather spend the money on paying teachers higher wages to improve the environment and culture that they are in.
Don‚Äôt force kids to go to college just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù
#####
Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, FB , Elon musk didn‚Äôt finish college you might have a your opinion on the short clip you showed a little bit of misconception on what your trying to explain. You have to watch the whole video to really understand what they where saying. Simply saying going to college is not a guarantee nowadays that the UBI is just fair to everybody not just a particular group of people. He did mention that there be some free college. A little misconstrued with the message your trying to combine.
#####
Andrew is one of few that can critique Sanders and I forgive it. His policies are tailored for the 21st century no matter the differences between them.
#####
I think you, as a progressive, is missing the big picture. We live in a highly polarized society that is divided among political lines. Just look at the vitriol spewed from both sides during the 2016 election. The great thing about Yang is how he is gathering support from both former Bernie supporters AND former Trump supporters. He is the only candidate who stands a chance at unifying this divide, and that is truly progressive. We need to be focusing on how to win during the election and the best way to win is to stand behind a guy who has the ability to gain support from the right.
#####
I'm with Bernie on this one... At least community College for free. Not necessarily all college, but let's at least do community college. I do agree with Yang about vocational work though.
#####
college is NOT for everyone. Why should we all have to pay for someone else's expensive college education? 
We can certainly find more ways to ensure college cost less in the future.
#####
Not everyone needs college. College was a 35k waste of money for me. Also he wants to give everyone 12k a year anyway so use that to pay for college?
#####
You can get an collage education for less than a thousand dollars a month if you want to.
#####
"The intrinsic value of college," my butt. Are people getting hazed to join a frat what you're talking about? Is the massive dropout rate what you're talking about? So many people don't even take college seriously and aren't ready for it. Making college free would only amplify that issue
#####
As an animation student, college was a literal waste of time. After being frustrated with the slow pace, I left and got an actual job in the industry working for Gary Vaynerchuk. I learned more in 6 months than I learned in 2 years. Take continuing education classes for topics and activities that interest you, and work in your desired career. Don't spend $25,000+ per year learning things you can learn for $500 a year.
#####
Sorry bro but ANDREW YANG FOR PRESIDENT your opinion is not what that man mean at all REMEMBER it needs to work for all
#####
Wonder is this guy has school debt lmao
#####
cancel that debt altogether?  how is that fair for those that paid it off? 10% of your income for 10 years is crazy good already.  there'll be a lot of pissed off voters if he's for full cancellation.  not to mention people who went to a lower tier university to save money, their friend that went to the expensive university gets to have their cake and eat it too. yang's worldview is correct, we're not going to use our tax payer money for you to feel good about yourself, go see a psychiatrist for that
#####
I know a lot of people who went to college they lack emotional intelligence and do not add valuable substance to humanity In Italy they have a system called the Reggio Emilia system its about making the dough
#####
What are you getting your PhD in?
#####
Shouldn‚Äôt we fix college first then offer it up for free?
#####
Ewww you sound SO self important
#####
When I went to college it was less than 5k tuition a year at a big ten university, had roommates and a job. Had no debt going out. My kids are breaking me with the tuition and related costs. Agree that it is not for everyone but everyone that wants to go and follows thru a trade degree or 4 year degree should be able to go without becoming a debt slave or depleting the family's financial stability.
I love sanders he has forced the conversation to a point I have been waiting decades for. His style of "socialism" is the old school 20th century approach which is ok but doesn't fully fit the 21st century. However he is on the right path and opening the doors for others to take it to the next level. 
I'm voting for Yang in the primary to give new ideas more support. Without Sanders 2016 there is no Yang 2020. Yang has even said so. To bash yang to lift up sanders is a douchebag divide and conquer move. Let the other dems bicker nonsensically Yang has made it clear he won't play that game and that alone makes him relevant.
#####
I agree that college and education is intrinsically valuable however I don't think we can afford college atm. I think after his first term in office (assuming he gets in office) he will probably create more college programs until it becomes essentially free.

Also if he cancels student loan debt you wont be able to get student loans. I could be wrong tho but that is my understanding of things
#####
Your argument for college is terrible. It doesn't matter if you "found yourself". The fact is that a lot of ppl go to college and either have no idea what they want to do, or major in something stupid. Then they end up getting a low paying job that doesn't even require a degree. Whereas they could have gone to trade school (which not many ppl do anymore), and became an electrician, iron worker, carpenter, millwright, plumber, etc. The unions are dying for people. And these are good paying jobs with constant work. Too many ppl believe college is the only answer. We have to make them aware of the other options available. Not just throw taxpayer money away to send ppl to college that don't deserve it. 

Regarding your analysis on why college is getting more expensive. You said because of lower funding from the government. But private universities have gotten way more expensive than public universities, and the private schools have never received funding. Their profits are from tuition and donations. They are just greedy.

You want to cancel student loan debt, and believe me, I pay $1500 per month for my student loans, so I would love that, but what about the ppl who have been paying their loans the past 10-20 years? Do they get their money back that they paid?

Thanks so much for let us know about this. I can't wait. What I would like to see is an Andrew Yang / Tulsi Gabbard win in 2020. Or a Tulsi Gabbard / Andrew Yang win in 2020. Either way I'm good. Otherwise I'll just vote Green Party again. But, if Kamala Harris is the primary winner. I'm going to vote for Trump. The End.
#####
As it is right now a wife can abort a pregnancy without any input from her husband.  If he wants a family, why wouldn't he get any input.  That's morally wrong
#####
What a stupid opinion. You're running for president and you state you don't have any right to give input?? That's just being lazy answer and you trying to get votes.  If women decide to kill their babies at nine months should we just sit back with a beer and say 'ooohh well shoot I have a penis so my opinion doesn't matter. '
#####
Mr. Yang has struck me thus far as an extremely intelligent man.  Thus, I am surprised he said what he just did.  To claim that men should have no opinion in whether abortion is right or wrong is along the same lines as claiming someone must be a serial killer before they can claim what Jeffrey Domer did was wrong.  Or that you yourself must be a pedophile to discern that child molestation is wrong.  This is exactly what slave owners used to claim in attempt to silence abolitionists; unless you yourself own slaves you have no right telling me what to do with my slaves.  Mr. Yang is smarter than to believe in identity politics like this.  Mere distortion for propaganda sake like the rest of them.
#####
He will never win with that spineless pandering.
#####
All women how able to kill children in early age its not humans for me. This will be treated like  Holocaust in the future you will see now it's acceptable because I said things like that but if you do a little bit of research you will understand what it is and these politicians just wanna please woman because woman wants more and woman wanna Avoid Responsibility for ther actions.
#####
Ok  if womend have division on abortion man have to have decision in child support... yes?
#####
Andrew: I think it's ridiculous that men have any input on reproductive rights. 

Wait, wasn't it a panel of men on the supreme court that gave women the right to choose in Roe V Wade?
#####
Yang 2020!

[To Andrew Yang] I really want to support your overall platform.
Today Political Correctness is 1st World's form of terrorism.
I want to know if you genuinely gave this issue some critical thinking.
Do you at least support the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act?
When we're not allowed to talk, when one side constantly shouts down opposing perspectives, when they subscribe to mob justice and twitter hit jobs no one can reach any kind of compromise.

#####
This irresponsible view is appalling. ex: Ask a serial killer or any genuine criminal whether they're innocent, the answer will always be emotionally compromised and self-serving; Ask a verizon special interest individual impartially, whether they support Net Neutrality or not, the answer will inevitably have immense bias. 
Yang's advantage was his supposed adherence to facts, not policy doctored by virtue signaling and emotion-based foundationless beliefs. I thought he was better than this.

[Disliked]

We all know by now that CNN is always in the tank for someone specific... They helped dog pile Bernie in the last election so Hillary would get the nomination and they pushed the fake "Russia collusion" story as hard as they could hoping to topple Trump... and they wonder why they have lost so many viewers and have gained the reputation of "fake news" along with MSNBC. When will they learn?


As far as Andrew Yang, I liked him A LOT until I found out that he thinks women should have the choice to kill their babies up to birth but shouldn't have the choice to circumcise their sons.. I mean come on people. One of the things I agree with Trump on is this... "USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE"

Andrew yang‚Äôs slogan: make Americans great again.
#####
Reparations ? How about you get to live in the USA ? Plus not all black people are from Africa . Some came from Jamaica , Haiti . And how is it fair that black men and women get a check for something they never experienced ? You don't think white people are hurting or been held down ?? Go check out what the government has done for poor white  Appalachian people in the last 20 years and compare that to what the government has done for the Black communities .  This isn't 1865 or 1965 its 2019 and people on both sides have been hurting . Reparation talk only separates us . All races have suffered for too long .

When you morons vote for Yang, DONT BE SUPRISED WHEN HE TAKES YOUR GUNS AWAY. AND BACKPEDDLES ON ALL THE BS HE SAID ON TECH CENSORSHIP. Did you idiots learn nothing from years of Obama's lies? DEMOCRATS. ALWAYS. LIE. YOU. BRAINDEAD. SHEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Politicians change their politiacl beliefs according to their base, this asian american democrat is not going to see "white working class" as his base, no democrat does. So he'll move only further towards the radical left because thats what his base will truly be comprised of. And, at that point I'll bet any amount of money on earth that he'll backpeddle everything he said about tech censorship, possibly even pass laws to make it easier for big tech, AND he'll try for a full scale GUN GRAB (which any logical American knows means civil war) as this is what the democrat party truly wants. But hey, when your bank accounts have been frozen, your social media shut down only to be used to dox you for being a "nazi", hate mobs mass around your house from said doxing, civil war has broken out leading to mass amounts of death, and the power grid is down from said war, as you eat your expired soup from a rusty can pondering either to use you last remaining bullets on the mob or on yourself. YOU IDIOTS CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY YOU VOTED FOR IT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really like this guy.  Reminds me of Elon Musk.  Someone just tell him to stop with the laughing .  Personally I love that hes a happy dude,  it appeals to me, but the majority I'm sure would prefer him seem more serious, stern, etc.  He will also be commander n chief. So he also needs to project strength

Beautiful answer to the question of reparations at min 42. This Freedom dividend or Universal basic income will have an extremely positive impact in low income,  disenfranchised, marginalized and underserved communities.
It will then be up to us to get together, fix up our houses, donate to our Boys & Girls Clubs, renovate our churches, start new enterprises, etc. I am just blown away by the possibilities a $100,000 or more of new money coming into my neighborhood every month. I did not think I would live to see this day. But here it is being handed to us if we would just get together and get this man elected. Let us have these conversations with each other. No holding back now. We cannot miss this opportunity
#####
Mark! Thank you for doing this interview, brother üôèüèæ
#####
I like how she switches her tone at 26:50 when talking to the black host while talking differently to Andrew. That was funny lol.
#####
Blacks need to give up on this reparations it not going to happen. it better to focus on local business and being competitive in the market place. I know easier said than done however the odds is far better
#####
Fuck this guy, calling it "unfortunate" that Trump is our President. I will never vote for you, you piece of shit

Looking forward for Yang to be on the debate.
#####
Love Yang! He's got me ready to vote in 2020!
#####
Andrew Yang 2020! Make USA A symbol of greatness again.
#####
He is right though i did heard alaska is giving money to the citizen that live there.
#####
Mark trying to combine UBI with reparations was a stupid idea and a bad way to frame the question of reparations. As a black man, why was that the only question he would ask a presidential candidate about fighting institutional racism?
#####
Can‚Äôt wait to see him in debates.
#####
Yang makes a lot of sense...he's even got Tucker Carlson of Fox News behind him, and Tucker know he's running as a Democrat...got my vote Yang!
#####
Give to Andrew's campaign to ensure he is included in the debates
#####
Reperations.... hahaha! no...
#####
I‚Äôll take 10K per month thank you very much. Congress makes more than that and they accomplish ? So yes I will take 10K and I would like that electronically transferred to my account. Thanks

There's a local supermarket that has usually only one cash register worker at all times, they just have 12x self-checkout computers.
Compared to the supermarket near-by they usually have 6 cashiers working the manual check outs because they have no self-checkout.
Twice the work for 1/100th of the cost, I'm surprised every day that the other supermarket hasn't converted yet.

Not left not right, time to move Forward. Andrew Yang 2020.   I just donated & hope to see Yang on the debate stage.
#####
1,000 dollars a month would be such a life changer for me. I could do so many things business wise that I've always wanted to do. I have the worst luck so I know this guy won't be elected.
#####
I really really really want this guy to be president. I just wish he was running as a Republican. Hey Andrew Yang, how can I get ahold of you?¬†I have a few questions.
#####
That question is not good to ask. Would one race get more money? Thats dividing. Yang is trying to unite
#####
Hong Kong and Macau give out money to their citizens. This is why America is the greatest country! Nothing is impossible! Invest in training people for new skillsets, not in sending them back to mining shafts.
#####
Yes for Yang, keep the conversation going!
#####
"Money in people's hands will grow the economy." AMEN Mr. Yang! Andrew Yang 2020! Not left or right, but FORWARD.
#####
playing devils advocate here. if i was challenging yang. i would point out not all the jobs were lost due to automation, but rather shipped out overseas due to cheaper labor in places like china and mexico. What are your plans addressing the exodus of jobs to over seas countries.
#####
Audio too low
#####
Here is an example of the damage government handouts can do right here in America. 

https://youtu.be/pQ4lnDy2xnQ
#####
he could become the surprise candidate.
Universal basic income is the biggest political idea of the 21st century!
#####
He said higher education is too expensive because of the proliferation of useless administrators, and he has an intelligent solution by using financial aid to reward colleges for reducing administrative costs.
There is too much useless corporate culture wasting money in administration in primary education too.
Too much administration is why education is too expensive and also healthcare too.
#####
If you are a Democratic, you should support Yang for 2020, he has the vision for the future of Americans life should be, and it will be bad, if we don‚Äôt do anything ahead of time , big high tech companies will eliminate Americans jobs.
#####
I and my family will vote for you, GO YANG!!!!‚Äô All 99% Americans need to live better. NOT the 1% billionaire
#####
EVERYBODY would drop off TANF, SSI, and GA and EBT for a Basic Income of 1000.

"Foreign competition, not automation, was behind the stunning loss in factory jobs."

NOT AUTOMATION

Awesome vision.  The only candidate ever who spotted America's chronic problems and knows how to solve the,  make Andrew Yang your president.  Very invigorating and inspirational.  Razor sharp smart and sounds authentic and sincere.

23:15 ‚Äútrickle up economics‚Äù not an attractive term. So you want economics to trickle up? To the rich?
#####
Retirement. Education. Homeownership. Choose only one. Most working class families face this dilemma. UBI will greatly help close the gap.
#####
We are tired of all politicians or billionaire party. They don‚Äôt represent for 99% of Americans. Americans life style go down for last 40 years since I immigrated to the America. It‚Äôs time to change humanity first.
#####
Who has the vision, the future of success is there. Andrew Yang has the vision for 99% of Americans future
#####
Andrew Yang is fearmongering on the one hand and offering America a solution on the other hand in the form of a monthly bribe in exchange for our votes.

UBI is theft!

Robbing Peter to pay Paul is immoral.
#####
FACT:  IF Andrew yang makes the UBI a minimum of $2,000/Month, THEN he has my vote for 8 years!!!!!!!!  OTHERWISE; I will store my vote in my mind until America turns into a Dystopia and Americans will be FORCED to have to defend their rights using the 2nd amendment!  The ELITE must be eradicated by any means!  USA is no longer functional!  There is no motivation left!
#####
I will be voting for Andrew Yang or Tulsi Gabbard in 2020. It not one of
 these two I'll vote Green Party again. The rest of the Democrats suck 
eggs.
#####
The one thing that really annoys me is how the professional class and owner class has been put on a damn throne over the past 30 to 40 years having Washington give everything to them while the worker has been systematically destroyed and impoverished! These where political choices and now our country is in revolt. The Democratic Party created this right wing insurgency we are facing. They have been useless as a party since Carter and Clinton. I am not complaining just telling the truth. This whole Meritocracy is the be all end all is BULLSHIT!
#####
Americas middle class was strongest when the rich were taxed at 90 %. Wealth redistribution /ubi is badly needed for American society.
#####
Big business finally figured out how to get more money out of the hands of the rich and the middle class.

Just transfer their money into the hands of the poor.

UBI is really a Universal Business Income.

Wages will go down and prices will go up.

Amazing conversation guys, brilliant insights about 'writing down the goals', I can agree with that. Thanks. You will get my vote Andrew.
#####
The major problem is "believing" AI is above and has greater value then We The People. Put those thoughts in there proper place. Tax the heck out of all companies all over the world out of thinking companies "those individuals" are superior. This united effort will create a movement in governments all over the world. These United Nations will collectively put those companies "individuals" in check. Tax 75% of the gain from AI and distribute these to all people. Then see if those companies "individuals" continue to think that AI is the future. I understand technology. AI does have a place in our lives. To serve "We the People". Why would anyone bowel, sorry, bow, to the AI. Control those companies "individuals" into the ones in a dilemma. People are and always will be the ones in charge. Can you believe those companies "individuals" are giving greater value to AI companies. Why would those companies "individuals" do that, is a good question. By the way, Individuals of companies are doing this. Why would companies "individuals" do that was asked; This means that those  companies "individuals" are putting themselves above everyone else "outside the company". How does this make sense to "We the People". Allowing few companies "individuals" to self proclamation, to self importance, over the prosperity of all. "We the People" have the power to make it stop. To make AI serve "We the People". We the People are the lives of our earth. We the People are what is life. We are what is important.  Recall, from English, well actually, any language, Composition, the science behind the production of a great movie. The writers and directors of that movie have to mix in some truth into the story line to give the movie a personal touch. To make the move more exciting. That is done so we experience emotion. Movies always mix in some truth. Otherwise movie makers and companies trying to take over would be boring, would have no worth, because of the disconnect from "We the People". That is what those companies "individuals" are attempting to do. They want us to turn away from the real act. From the real issues. We know what this looks like. Trump uses it all the time. His gimmick is racism. Those companies "individuals" is turning us away from the truth. While we are looking in the other direction, those companies "individuals" will be trying to take "We the People" over. They are putting themselves in charge. Those companies "individuals" are using the same movie logic, disguising aggression with shadows of concern. That is politics. "We the People" are aware of those gimmicks because of years of experiences with those who try to govern at the expense of us, the true value. If we give those companies "individuals" the power, they will not stop there. They will spiral out of control. We the People have to restore our right to power. Those companies "individuals" believe we can't see through giving $1000 a month is under-valuating "We the People". That is trying to turn our attention. The are saying, go do the arts. Go learn something else. Get a job. Leave technology to those individuals. The companies "individuals" believe we can't see their movement. Their intent of taking over. They believe we can't see through this. YES! they can form logical statements, put words together.  We "The People" are the ones in power. Do not let those companies "individuals" reduce We The People to insignificant impoverished beings.
#####
Yang is the only one who will beat Trump.
#####
Andrew, money represents peoples time and labor, therefore, money does represent people. Your idea is to give people money for nothing through UBI is just a wealth redistribution from the productive to the unproductive. This will not work, it can't work, and you can't pay for it without heavy, heavy taxes. (I have seen your website.)
Human-centered capitalism is a non-free-market approach that would tax companies if they don't do what you think is right (what you are basically saying in this video). This is borderline communism and would increase crony capitalism because companies would bribe the government for favors worse than they are doing now.
UBI is just a bribe for votes. It would never happen even if you became President which won't happen either.

W/O Freedom dividend = society with desperate slavery

Do you know why it is always referred to as "Economic Theory" and not the "Science of Economics?" Because that is all it is, Theories. Propositions that we are told are vitally important to our society which, unfortunately, Cannot be proven within the laws of nature. The laws that govern the known universe and which all scientific study is bound by. If it cannot be proven within the laws of nature it is not scientific, its BS, BAD SCIENCE! Junk, Worthless. There is no "Hidden hand" in nature.

The establishment won't let him  be president, he's too smart.

Friendly YangGang Reminder: If we don't show up to vote for him in the primaries, it doesn't matter how well his arguments 'would' play out against Trump. This is why it's SO important to not only spread his name and message, not only donate in whatever capacity you're able, but also to register to Dem party so that we can participate in the primaries and get him nominated - ESPECIALLY our friends from the Right. PLEASE help me spread this message in comment sections on Yang content; feel free to copy/paste any part of this to help raise awareness and participation - it's a great totally-free way that anybody over 18 can support him, even if they don't intend to vote Dem at all in the General Election :

" If you want Yang to win, don't forget to register into Dem party so you can vote in the Dem primary and get him nominated! Otherwise we'll never see him in the general election against Trump. ALSO don't forget to spread this message to all Yang supporters, ESPECIALLY our friends from the Right! Registering into Dem party has no impact on which way anybody chooses to vote in the general election, but it's the only way to help shape who the Dem party pushes forward. (optional clause: Even if you'd still vote Rep in the General, PLEASE contribute your vote to this campaign as a message to Dem Party establishment.) Thank you, and have an awesome day! #Yang2020 "

I would really love to see YangGang spreading this message around to help maximize our chances at victory - lots of people forget about these details of the election process, and that could really work against Yang, especially considering how many 'I was a conservative for 30 yrs and I love this guy, he'll get my vote' people he's converting (DEFINITELY respond to those comments with this message). 

...Additionally, if I keep posting it myself, YT will probably think I'm a bot and ban me lmao help me out guys. Hope whoever's reading has a great day! #securethebag

Each person worth is measured by how useful they are to society.
Just like China.

Fresh thinking.
Americans seem to like the State to look after them.
Well done, Yang.

I thought this was a good interview.

Andrew Yang you have my Vote.

Good job Andrew. You went on an obviously right right wing show and was awesome. I keep getting more and more impressed with him

Human centered capitalism was also the idea behind the Nazi economy that brought about the economic miracle in Germany (sorry it‚Äôs not PC to bring that up)

Im Chinese, America is not going to accept an Asian guy to be the president of US just yet. The Asian identity kills him.

I'm pretty sure I'm voting for Andrew Yang

He's clearly weak with regards to foreign policy, but I do admire his spirit

#####
I‚Äôve been watching yang videos for the past couple weeks, and it always seemed like foreign policy was a big black hole in his agenda. Interesting to see a little local station press him on the issues, and he really didn‚Äôt have any answers. His domestic policy is great, but he‚Äôs probably gonna have to eventually align himself with people who know more about foreign policy so he can come up with better answers than ‚Äúwe need to make informed decisions‚Äù and ‚Äúwe need to align ourselves with our allies‚Äù
#####
Russia Russia Russia. Their country spends more on education and science than they do on their military for F sake.  Their military budget is 1/10th what the US spends. Does that sound like a country gearing for war? The only damn thing Russia wants is a fair trading field and for the US to stop strong arming other nations into submission for control of their resources. These wars for oil must stop.
#####
He should already start to hold big public meetings in different states ... Make your voice loud and clear.I am here to be a grassroot free worker for Andrew Yang. Please get endrosments from Obama, he likes your vissions. You need some top and bottom supports and we are here. YangGang 2020

It's really hard for Yang to answer a question on foreign military policy. Did you think Caesar and Napoleon were a hundred percent confident in their plans? They were geniuses in their field yet it came down to plenty of experience and intuition. And plenty of times their intuition nearly got them killed.

Basically Yang is proposing which we have seen been implemented from Bush onwards relying more on 'client-states' (allies for a more palatable term for modern day ears), which the Romans and Chinese foreign policy relied on to retain control and dominance without stretching their forces too much. That and seesawing between absolute control of territories requiring huge amount of strain on the empire coffers, their citizen wellbeing and number of soldiers required. Right now, I would argue that in theatres like Afghanistan, was America hoping to go into a limited war and win (kick out commies) but instead being escalated into a war they are finding hard to get out of.

Yang gave the right answer, the honest one, which is, let's look at the options on the table and study it, then I'll give you a clear answer like my economic plans. Stop trying to keep fighting because you can't walk away from it, even after your goals still haven't been met (Clausewitz theory on limited war, Imperial Japan in WW2). It's pretty clear that current foreign policy is empowering American allies to counter Russian influence without committing to another potential Afghanistan. Where American and Soviets kept punching harder in response to what the other side did to undermine them. This bravado is sometimes good and very good American trait, but it could just easily cloud one's vision. Which is, is it so bad to let Russians think that they won? Let them think that, lure them in, let them place more and more soldiers and resources whilst they are still under embargo. 

And then when it all blows up in their face, America asserts themselves again. You've won with less resources, less human lives lost and still achieved objectives.

But to the voters, that (idk answer, which smart people are not afraid of admitting) would be seen as weakness, running from the enemy and inability and mostly a negative dock. America can win like the old powers did. With patience, population surplus and a helluva better economy than their enemies.

This guy is so refreshing. I think America needs such leader who has clear set of plans to save and empower working class ordinary citizens who are the bedrock of American economy. Besides, unlike regular politicians, this guy is exceptionally bright and educated who can precisely dissect the ills of the failing economy and policies that are affecting millions of ordinary citizens. American people should wake up for once to make this guy the President who can make great things happen for America and rest of the world. I am Canadian, by the way!

we need universal health system like europe !!! way cheaper for government than what USA have now and way better for Americans, the only disadvantage is that doctors and nurses will be paid less (Anyway paying a doctor 300k/year seems a lot, same for nurses who get 80$/hour)

Andrew Yang 2020 !! Who gives a shit about the middle east when our country is collapsing . You think a family struggling to pay their bills gives a shit about that fucking shit . I tell you what you need to cover , the boiling blood of pissed off people having to work 50-60hrs a week and still not have Shit !!! Trump was not the answer ! Yang is the Answer !!!
#####
Props to this interviewer for asking tough questions..also kudos to Andrew for answering with poise.
#####
Yang FTW.

Most people don't get it. To come from nothing and strive to make it is very hard. Personally have been working since I graduated high school could not imagine not working, staying busy, and making a difference for the better in peoples lives. Although from the beginning I've felt used and abused by all the companies I've ever worked for. Underpaid, lack of security, unhealthy conditions, lack of health benefits the list goes on and on. When income tax time comes seems like if you don't have dependents you get no help. I've gotten so many ideas and work so hard to make it and turn my goals into reality. Besides that is how I was raised, I could never stop. I make less then 15000 a year and with UBI would be able to move up expand and grow individually. Would assume everyone speaking above knows little to nothing about struggle. Of course I can go apply for aid or welfare although I refuse to limit myself and put the gov't on my throat to try to degrade me further. America is the greatest country in the world no where else i'd rather be. We must come to some middle ground to allow further progression and to stop the evil that is "corrupt" capitalism. I'm all for the rich get richer, but give the little guy a chance. I'm going to make it regardless of UBI or not, would be nice to at least think that my country cares more about me and others who are far worse off.

Everyone complains about corrupt corporate lobbying in Washington but they don't contribute 10 dollar toward  candidates like andrew as their voice. He is campaigning for money for the poorest and if people don't support him his campaign, corporate lobby will win again. Trump will give u 1000 dollar, or do you prefer big government with wasteful welfare programs??
#####
He's such an exciting candidate!

Love this dude
#####
Still debating if I‚Äôm on the #yanggang, I think he‚Äôs going to have a tough time in the debate round concerning immigration and foreign policy, immigration he may make a good argument for economically, but in terms of national defense and strategy, he speaks vaguely and it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs not his strongest suite
#####
Andrew has a great vision over an old system that no longer works for our society.
#####
Andrew Yang is the true visionary we have been looking for, wake up America!

I like what Andrew Yang is saying, it makes a lot of sense. My only question: He says introduction of a VAT tax would generate a $ 700- 900 billion revenue for the government.
Does that mean in spite of abolishing state sales taxes or would the VAT tax come on top of state sales taxes. I'm from Germany and there VAT tax (when it was introduced in the late 1960's) replaced sales taxes. Mind you, the average VAT tax in the EU countries is now approx. 20%, with Luxembourg 17% at the low and Hungary 27 % at the high end.

good way to make all the big companies leaving USA if you try to tax them more. How can anyone actual thing there is such thing as free money.

Bernie Sanders has more name recognition than Yang.  Yang has the advantage being younger.

Looking at the idiots commenting here I can see America is FUCKED. There is NO SUCH thing as FREE, someone has to pay for all of it.

Well fuck this commie bastard

I think Andrew Yang would be a great prez candidate for 2024, but for now Trump is got it going on and we need MAGA 45 for a second term.

Reason why no one stands a chance in 2020 against Trump is because there is not very much any one of them can improve upon what Trump is resolving with swift acumen at the root level of infested issues as we speak.

Clearly 2024 would be a better window for any challenger...but I guess they are all just establishing name recognition at this point!

"Education is falling as compaired to the rest of the world."  He never said why.

It turns out that if you exclude black and hispanic student scores America becomes competitive again.

The most recent PISA results, from 2015, placed the U.S. an unimpressive 38th out of 71 countries in math and 24th in science. 

When US racial and ethnic groups are separately compared with other countries, Asian and white students regularly perform at or near the top of international rankings, while 
black and Hispanic students typically rank at or near the bottom.

I really appreciate Yang trying to solve our economic problem, but his number just doesn't add up. doesn't matter what he wants to call it, freedom dividend. It is still socialist program. it will bankrupt US. government control all resources and spend 5 more trillions. the tax income = tax rate * private income. Just ask yourself how much more private income needs to increase in order to have that extra 5 trillions government spending.
#####
#Yang2020 Go Andrew Yang !!
The world is not zero sum, the world sums to the progress we make
If you think the dividend is wasted on people, it says more about you than it does about people

OMG!

The core message in Yangs entire campain is that the rich are gobbling up all the wealth in America.

His whole campain is built on the premise that the US economy is a ZERO SUM GAME.

Then he just turned around and condemed such thinking.

So which is it going to be Mr. Confusion?

VAT (Value Added Tax) is a CONSUMPTION TAX paid by the CONSUMER¬† not the business.

Yang will be taxing consumers to provide consumers with his freedom dividend. 

Yang will be Yangking money out of the hands of the rich and middle class and giving it to the poor who will spend it in stores. 

This will just increase profits for businesses and further encourage them to automate.

Lets just call it what it is.

A YAT.

A Yang Added Tax.

Yang is not a serial entrepreneur, which is by definition an entrepreneur who continuously comes up with new ideas and starts new businesses. 

Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business. 

The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs. 

Yang has personally created two businesses. 

2.

Stargiving.com and Venture for America.

Yang is a typical entrepreneur, who has twice come up with an idea, started a company, then seen it through and played an important role in the day-to-day functioning of said company.

The rest of the time Yang was an employee.

EMPLOYEE:
1999 corporate attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 

ENTREPRENEUR:
2000 launches a start-up Stargiving.com, which folded in 2001.¬† 

EMPLOYEE:
Yang joined a healthcare software startup MMF Systems, Inc., as its Vice President and third hire. 

EMPLOYEE:
2005 joined friend Zeke Vanderhoek at a small test preparation company, Manhattan Prep.

EMPLOYEE:
2006 becomes CEO of Manhattan Prep.
2009 Manhattan prep acquired by Kaplan.

ENTREPRENEUR:
2011 Founded Venture for America.
2017 Stepped down as CEO.

November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for President of the United States in 2020.

So in all honesty Yang has 12 years of entrepreneurial experience spread over two companies, one of which was a failure.

In contrast a serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people.

Yang.¬† You just need to start one more business to earn the bragging rights of Serial Entrepreneur.

Untill then give it up.

If he only knew at that time that HE would be the one gettin kneecapped this year, he wouldnt have said that the DNC would be different this time around.
#####
0:50 Which is now on the record thanks to Wikileaks
#####
The same thing is happening to Yang this election. There is abysmal coverage on Yang‚Äôs campaign, despite a huge grassroots following. #endtheYangblackout #securethebag fabluxelite.com
#####
well, i guess we all know by now that joe biden is the new hillary clinton, and the dnc will absolutely pull the same stunt.
they are already discussing how to stop bernie....
#####
What the DNC did is treason. Interfering with the elections should be taken much more seriously than it is.
#####
Just to remind everyone... There's a reason why Bernie always ran as an independent from both parties for many years. The DNC has been historically right leaning and pro-corproate for a very long time now (personally why i think people are losing faith in the political system in the US. most of these gave up following politics). If you go look at the clip of Amy Goodman criticizing Bill Clinton and his actions in the early 2000's, it is evident that Bill Clinton isn't left leaning politically (neither is Hilary).
#####
Last Election: The Democrats won the popular vote by a little(Less than 10%). The Republicans won the Electoral College by a larger gap(more than 10%). The U.S. elections are Electoral, not populism. Bernie would have done worse in swing states than Hilary. Most swing states moved heavily towards Trump, not Clinton.
#####
Kamala is trash lol. Hillary 2.0
#####
You don't need to worry so much. Andrew Yang will be the next President of the United States. And Bernie Sanders will always be remembered as one of the most important people who paved the way to the bright future of America and humanity in general.
#####
If you have, or have had, grandparents in their 80's, you probably know that Sanders is simply too old to be effective as president.
#####
So you praise Andrew Yang for bringing it up because it benefits Bernie.  But you want to make sure you "knee cap" Andrew Yang by saying that because he's not for free college, you need to put out an entire video about how this is why you shouldn't back Andrew Yang.  Like the way you tried to really reach and throw shade on Yang by saying he has "Friends in Media" like he's in cahoots with the people who knee capped Bernie.  Wow you really are the worst.
#####
Is Mr. Wang going to take care of his friends or the people? We have heard this before!
#####
This kneecapping is happening right now, every appearance these candidates have you can see the difference in treatment. Look at the people and their questions in the townhall meetings of CNN, look at the questions MSNBC etc. ask the different candidates, they are blatantly transparant. With candidates they support they will not ask any questions on content or policy. With others such as sanders they will perform a live muller investigation into the exact numbers etc. Complete and utter bias. Stay vigilant people!
#####
Andrew Yang has so many interesting things to say. He's a guy that talks solutions and not just points out problems.   
But somehow the least interesting part of the interview gets picked up here.  
I expected better from the Humanist Report.
#####
You‚Äôre trying too hard to make a point.. simply said yang told us they screwed Bernie. And we‚Äôre seeing the same with yang.
#####
LOL Bernie bros. get lubed up cause the DNC is picking  Kamala to ram up your tailpipe this time. They will get the blacks to vote for her simply because she's part black.
#####
Look at you trying to kneecap Andrew Yang
#####
Sounds like Yang should stay in so far as he can gain attention, but when appropriate he should drop out and get behind Bernie.
#####
Sorry to have to inform you, but it IS happening again. And as a result, Trump will win again.
#####
of course they did, the mainstreams job is to give good coverage to those that control them and ruins those that are threats.
#####
The mainstream media will do as they please. Wake up idiot. Ur not gonna do shit.
#####
I mean üôÑ duh! Water is wet! The moon is cold and in space !
#####
And last but not least, cheat Bernie again, and have a full-scale uprising on your hands, bitches!
#####
There's enough internet savvy ppl. out there that can counter-punch|knee-cap  mainstream and right-wing neocon media. Bernie's in people, lets take our government back!
#####
Just look at how CNN covered that Bernie is running again for 2020, they already start talking about him in a dismissive way. Quite disgusting to say the least.
#####
Um... the exact same people are still in the same position. Andrew yang is lying.
Don‚Äôt believe his Ubi lies, he‚Äôll never deliver.
#####
There was a media black of anyone who wasn't Hillary or Trump. All I saw in 2016 was Hillary or Trump. I had to go actively seeking out info on other candidates and I did. I really hope that doesn't happen this time.
#####
This interview convinced me Andrew Yang is not fit to be president.  If he really believes the DNC has changed, his judgement is beyond poor.
#####
We already see the media blacking out Tulsi!
#####
But...but...but what about the RUSSIANS?
#####
They‚Äôve already been kneecapping Tulsi Gabbard!
#####
How terrible to not report the news but to actively effect election results and foil campaigns but support others. So much for believable media!
#####
Both parties are corrupt as f. Need a mass revolt.
#####
CLICK BATE AND lIE in the  
 title. He did not say his friends had it out for Bernie. Ever hear of journalism?
#####
What is this Andrew Yang whoever saying the DNC has completely changed now???????????
#####
Obviously the media has put their power behind Kamala Harris all ready. Could happen with another mainstream Dem, but for now there are all ready nine established candidates running just to start and several unannounced that we know will. The Town Hall during prime time is a clue into who the networks want to put a light on and the days of impartiality by our news networks is long long in the past. They have Biden and Bernie as the top two on almost every prediction or poll out there. I think with Biden they're wrong. I think he has a hard time in the era of progressives as well as non establishment constituents. Harris plays the part better even if it's a total fabrication. She's not a lefty. She's an ex state prosecutor and has not hidden her political beliefs up until the last year. Maybe less. Now suddenly they're all pretending to be on board with almost every policy on Bernie's agenda. People really need to watch out for this with a majority of names out there. The only one who I believe is maybe Tulsi Gabbard. Even Warren is a little sketchy on MFA and free college. The other issues are easier to claim support for like minimum wage increase, climate change, etc. They're weak on issues that are socially democratic and framed as freebies to younger Americans. Like instead of MFA lowering the age to 50 and free college with words like "more affordable"  and "access"  to debt free policies. Right now I see Bernie, Biden, Harris, and Beto as front-runners but things could change. Beto and Bernie haven't announced yet but I think they will.
#####
Good lookin out Mr. Yang, but we already knew that...
#####
Tulsi is great but she doesn't have a prayer. So the question is who wants what we want and can actually win within the system??
#####
The DNC has rigged it so they can choose the desired corporate shill no matter what happens. In the end it's up to the Chair to decide if a candidate is in line with party positions. So Bernie, Tulsi or Elizabeth could get a majority vote in the primary and still be deemed a non viable candidate because of their progressive positions. This triggers a second vote in which the super delegates will decide. Wall St met with their potential candidates; Kamala and Joe Biden among them. And one of them was quoted as saying that "it can't be Bernie or Liz, either of them would be unacceptable."
#####
They can try all they want but the public is more aware than ever. It‚Äôs easier than ever to figure out who the corporate candidates are. Tammany Hall is alive and well today. ‚ÄúLet the people vote for whoever they want, as long as Tammany gets to chose the candidates!‚Äù 

Let‚Äôs give the elite something to shit their pants about in 2020. 

Bernie 
Tulsi
Andrew Yang
All these people should be at the forefront of progressive candidates. Not he shills they have now. Biden? No chance
#####
Where's this new leaf? Where damnit?!?
#####
They're tipping the scale for Kemal Harris. On Trevor Noah they labeled Kamala Harris as one of the candidates trying to legalize weed. when actually she's one of the main prosecutors that threw a shitload of people in prison for using weed.
#####
He said last time. They are still doing this
#####
That's why Bernie I think has been brought we don't know all the  crazy shot they were doing to Bernie that we don't know about. They scared him into submission..
#####
I listened to that podcast with Joe Jogan and Andrew Yang. He's a very interesting guy and a very lucid thinker with a lot of ready facts and stats in his head. He also doesn't talk like a politician at all. He's so frank! I think I actually like Yang a lot.. Maybe even more than Bernie?? Wow I'm shocking myself right now..
#####
The DNC has ‚Äúchanged‚Äù but appointed Howard Dean to be in charge of the information that will grant candidates access to debates, even though he has publicly said he does not think Tulsi is qualified? They fooled me!
#####
Exactly.  Bernie SHOULD endorse Tulsi.  We, the People should do our best to promote her!  She has all the right credentials.
#####
Fuckery. LOL, Mike.
#####
MLK was killed after he began to speak out against the Vietnam war. Of course there are still people around who will respond violently towards tho who speak out against the status quo.
#####
The longer we wait for Bernie to announce his run in 2020, the more likely he‚Äôll not run, so the DNC won‚Äôt have to kneecap Bernie.
#####
Andrew Yang claiming that the DNC is no longer corrupt and will not be dirty when it comes to elections is a joke. I can't believe he said that with a straight face.
#####
The establishment would rather have an "orange clown" in the White House than a progressive like Bernie Sanders. So, expect more shenanigans like we saw in 2016 from the MSM and Democratic party. We're already seeing it, with the blackout of Tulsi Gabbard from MSM coverage.
#####
I like this guy a lot but I totally disagree with him on the DNC, they haven't changed or turned over a damned thing. Same people, same tactics, same mindset. If you have any doubts, look up the Tim Canova / Debbie Wasserman Schultz scandal that the media is ignoring. Same sh*t ,Same toilet and the DNC is involved make no mistake.
#####
What do you mean re-litigating? When was it properly ever litigated? HRC is still in the party, she never suffered any consequences for that. Let's first litigate it, only then the spectre of litigating it will arise.
#####
Yang saying that the DNC has changed it's way, made me not trust him. I know nothing about him but that was a big red flag to me.
#####
Yang blew a great opportunity to explain to Rogan's audience the control that corporate interest have over our Democracy. I can't believe how tentative and naive both him and Rogan were on this topic. Corporate interest were not only trying to protect Hillary, they were also protecting Trump. This point was lost and allows too much focus to be placed on the DNC and Hillary. Money in politics is the real game rigger here.
#####
Let‚Äôs go phishing!
#####
This is old news.  Wikileaks was three years ahead of you
#####
Media and DNC still full of shit.
#####
I had liked Yang b4 but the way he laughed about this is REALLY disturbing and a turn off
#####
That's a great impersonation.
#####
I'm so sick of being sold out. Funny thing Bernie is still #2 in the polls even with all this crap going on. Biden is outpacing him, but that's pretty much because young folks don't have land lines and you can't phone poll them.
#####
The Democratic Party has long lost its way. It‚Äôs going to take more than just a few progressives in office to change it. We have to get informed and vote.
#####
*establishment media* "yeah but this time it will work" smh.
#####
Thank you both.  Corporate media is stupid, I financially support Independent media, but I won't pay for cable and I only buy local newspapers.  I refuse to put any money toward Corporate media because they are no longer the 3rd Estate.
#####
Yang for 2020! He basically has the same progressive platform and he offers up to date policies, such as, the American Dividend. I really would love to see JRE at the White House interviewing President Yang. I feel that Yang has stronger knees than Bernie. I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôd be allies if Yang were to win. Yang would use Bernie to push single payer MORE!
#####
Andrew Yang for President 2020.
#####
Has Bernie ever said anything about UBI? Yang has made a pretty awesome case for it.
#####
At a guess, Bernie is negotiating to assure that 2016 BS doesn't play out again.
#####
How does one LITERALLY shill?
#####
Isn‚Äôt it bigoted to mock the president‚Äôs skin color? Like what are the other orange people supposed to think of us???
#####
I *LOVE* re-litigating 2016 because that‚Äôs the ONLY way progressives can keep the DNC‚Äôs treachery on everyone‚Äôs minds.
#####
I thought trump was doing a greet job?
#####
I'm surprised that you're shocked.
#####
Hillary donors & MSM trying to make Kamala happen luckily ADOS ain't falling for those tactics & are rightly demanding tangibles. MSM is also trying to make Robert Francis O'Rourke a thing lol the real problem is how they will stymie Bernie.
#####
Look at mike acting like dnc is gonna let him do any thing fuck the dnc fuck all Dems Green Party all day
#####
No matter how the DNC handles the presidential primary, everyone should vote for Congress/House reps. Think about checks and balances EVEN IF Trump gets re-elected.
#####
Confirmed. It's because the rich do not want to pay their way. Bernie wants to make em... And the people that own msnbc and cnn are rich... Go figure.

They attacked Sanders using #metoo as a weapon recently. They went after Tulsi...

The MSM wants biden/harris. Wall street friendly...
#####
The DNC announced that the method they'll be using to select the candidate will be based largely on how well candidates poll as well as how much grassroots support they have.  I hear a lot of flowery rhetoric there, what I'm not hearing is that they'll remain objective and pick the candidate that people want.  Furthermore, they've created a centralized database of Democratic voter information that campaigns can access and put Howard Dean in charge of it, so a guy with a clear bias is in charge of dispensing the voter information candidates need to run their campaigns.
#####
They have given KH a free town hall and high praise,  The media used to give equal time. They are not informing us. They are selling us.   Thank goodness for indie political media, but I'm not sure its enough.  There are still too many people who think corporate media has informed them.
#####
#Bernie2020

Let‚Äôs make sure they understand we know that their short-sighted ‚Äúkneecapping‚Äù of Bernie Sanders resulted in Donald Trump as President. The country was clearly going populist and they‚Äôre self imposed corporate Bubble did not allow them to see what was happening. And still they struggle to comprehend.
#####
I am so sick of Hillary still trying to say she won the "popular" vote.
#####
Joe, 'how did they kneecap Bernie?' 

FUCK OFF JOE. LIKE YOU DONT KNOW. YOU AND DUNCAN TRUSSEL DISCUSSED THE RIGGING IN DEPTH. 

Sell out prick.
#####
Andrew, the same people who kneecapped Bernie run the DNC and media. Nothing has changed. Kamala is the new Hillary, Tulsi is the new Bernie. My God, I'm a bar worker and I'm more informed than a guy running for president. Scary.
#####
Joe Rogan playing dumb makes me want to throw up. He's such a little establishment bitch boy now. He only cares about himself and his own wallet, he doesn't like Sanders because he's a millionaire and he's pro weed because he smokes it. Just another out of touch millionaire looking out for his own interests. Sick of his shit. Used to really like the podcast now it's no better than that pod save America bullshit.

Now now you plebeian masses, watch and play the 1% game of politics as we collectively ring the toilet towards mass extinction, you instinctively devoid fools!  Enjoy politically waking up too late to our collective wake!
#####
Yeah, Tulsi Gabbard already clearly said, the DNC actively rigged the election against every democrat except Hillary Clinton for over a year before the election and Bernie got 70% of the vote in Hawaii but all the Super Delegates except Tusli Gabbard voted for Clinton so it went to Clinton. Its crooked as hell.

Than Trump lost by 3 million votes and wom the electoral college
#####
Since he supports UBI, I think he needs to work for the next administration.
#####
I didn't need Yang to tell me this. Ed Shultz already spilled the beans. RIP Mr. Shultz.

You keep the truth. It will always find a way into the light!

Tulsi and Yang for 2020.  Aloha

The DNC will never change, they need to just go away, we need a peoples party.

That podcast with Yang was great. allot of data on jobs and Freedom divident. Good job by Yang and Rogan.

Mainstream Media is has been Fake News for a long long time. All it took was for Trump and media Sabotage of Bernie for people to realize its all a sham and propaganda to push people to promote war and division.

These are the wrong people to be selling UBI to is he buying votes? The one was crossed arms the whole time. They‚Äôre all retired collecting social security than your just going to give money away especially Iowans. He needs the younger people.

Yes! The Socialist parasites are back with another TAX to stuff up our noses! Repeat after me: UBI is a Communist lie. UBI is a Communist lie. 
Every bit as nuts as Soetorocare & the green new steal.

And the sheep will suck it up & get fleeced as they always do. Any vote for any Commie Democrat is a baaaaa baaaaaa baaaaad idea.

And no explanation for how your going to fund this or that. All of which his policies sound like like socialist communist drivel. Which all be funded by increasing taxes more than likely. To drive jobs and economic growth outside the country again. Back to foreign countries. Nothing about fixing the countries high taxes and increasing taxes. And  inflation of prices. Because it all leads back to illegal immgration going unchecked. Also his stance on the 2nd ammendment. Which is further restrictions on legal gun owners. But not a word said about how most gun related crimes are vastly and majoritly by black and hispanics whom are in gangs. This guy is another race baiting soft speaking bigot. Its not americans its asains. Universal income equality so make everyone equally as poor in the long run. And you idiots are eating this shit up. Hes another leftist democunt cuntflappery puppet.

Andrew Yang is so intelligent. I really hope that he can communicate very complicated issues in a digestible way to the masses or he is not going to win. And that would be a big loss to all of us.

Big business finally figured out how to get more money out of the hands of the rich and the middle class.

Just transfer their money into the hands of the poor.

UBI is really a Universal Business Income.

Wages will go down and prices will go up.

Andrew Yang contridicts himself.

He has said that the reason local businesses are failing is because Amazon is taking over the markets.

The truth is that Americans are choosing to shop on line instead of in their local economy.¬† It is a matter of convenience and cost savings.

Now he makes the argument that people will spend their $1000.00 a month in their local economy.

That goes against his own reasioning. 

Yang changes the narrative to suite his needs in the moment.

He cares about truck drivers loosing their jobs but ignores the 2.5 million people he will displace with universal Medicare. 

Yang is a con man trying to bribe his way into the whitehouse.
#####
GDP measures exactly what it was intended to measure.

Andrew Yang seems to be couriously oblivious to the exsistance of SEDA. 

In his ignorance he wants to invent something that already exists.

The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment.

SEDA is an economic index that tracks 160 countries across three major elements: economics, sustainability and investment.
#####
The "freedom dividend" is not a dividend.

A dividend is 

a sum of money paid regularly (typically quarterly) by a company to its shareholders out of its profits (or reserves).

Paid by a company to its shareholders. 

UBI is a tax.¬† It is theft. It is a socialist plan to redistribute wealth.

You would think that a self proclaimed "serial entrepreneur" would understand the difference.

The freedom dividend will not bring freedom to those forced to pay it.

With the changing nature of work, we need #BasicIncome now. Income security/stability shouldn't be based on luck.
#####
you got my vote Andrew.
#####
Most of the people setting around the table with crossed arms look to be 65 or older. Their already getting a sort of "UBI" it's called Medicare.  So, why should they care. They certainly don't look like they care. I would guess they don't care, not one bit. What Andrew should have said to them is, "Are any of you 65 or older, still having to help your grown children or grand-children out financially." That would have been the thing to say. Then he could explain they wouldn't need help if they were getting UBI plus what they made from their jobs.
#####
#Yang2020  I would like to see a Yang/Gabbard win in 2020.
#####
Kamala will be another Hilary shrill.  Yang, Gabbard, or Sanders, in that order.
#####
#Yang/Gabbard 2020
#####
your research is pretty limited, what about #Yang2020 ?
#####
Bernie Sanders is a senator from Vermont not Virginia
#####
No. He keeps calling it for all but then explains that it is for all who want it. Basically a public option. All the high risk people will end up on the public plan and the low risk people will end up private so the private sector will keep making money at the expense of the public sector that will be burdened by all the sick people only. The private sector will till retain lobbyists also that will enable them to continue to tweak laws in their favor. No. No. No. And no.
#####
We're now in the era of YangGang!
#####
Is he for single payer, tax payer funded system, or a market based approach to get "affordable care for all"?
#####
Bernie/Yang2020. Think about it.
#####
An unearned 12k a year for everyone.  Who doesn‚Äôt see how this is ludicrous?  Does anyone else hear Ayn Rand laughing uproariously?
#####
I am so sick I dont know what roundup did I need a kombucha I am still blaming roundup somewhat because he told cenk somethings that werent true

As well as some other things
#####
You guys sound dumb asf lmao
#####
This is mind blowing that Yang is the only one running for POTUS out of 20 candidates that's discussing specific policies in depth!
#####
UBI and Medicare for all will be way too expensive. Pick and choose one.
#####
Just saw this video. Well done. Questions are good and relevant and Mr. Yang's answers are short, precise and right to the point! I have drawn to Yang's candidacy only recently and this video is another supporting piece. Thanks!
#####
Why hasn‚Äôt Cenk had Andrew Yang on tyt more?
#####
Look at all these lazy bums supporting Yang.
#####
TYT needs to make Yang their champion. He checks all the boxes and then some. And to all the ‚Äúinflation‚Äù fear mongers, $1000 a month isn‚Äôt going to allow companies to push prices up, an extra $1000 isn‚Äôt going to make me okay with my $14 dollar meal at a restaurant suddenly jumping to $20.
#####
$1000 a month?! Holy shit I‚Äôm in.
#####
Tie it to inflation, otherwise, it'll just be gobbled up.  It's not like the US couldn't afford this... just stop throwing s**tloads of money at the obscenely over-armed military.   Also, put the money back in the Social Security coffers that various politicians (mostly Republicans) have robbed throughout history.
#####
This guy is my Dark Horse for the Nomination. He just talks like a normal rational human, not a politician.
#####
make it $2500 a month, tied to inflation, and we're having a conversation
#####
ok, so the banks and landlords now get $12,000 more per year per tenant.


As it stands in the US economy, without price controls, UBI will be at best useless.
#####
7:04 oh no
#####
16 year olds have bills too, but they can't vote if you are wondering why they don't get a pay out.
#####
GREAT idea, but the government would find some way to take it away again. I'm on Social Security, and ever time I get a so-called "cost of living" increase, the state just ups my spend-down by that same amount just to keep my medicais. Living costs go up, but the tiny amount of money I have to live on stays the same ...
#####
Love it
#####
Does this UBI come in addition to safety nets like social security for retirees or the handicapped, or EBT for working  employees not paid a living wage?
#####
Bet the majority of the GOP and DNC are crapping their pants about this dude..
#####
I could live off of that.
#####
Machines have been taking over jobs for a long time.  It first started on the farms, then in the factories, now it's creeping into the offices and retail stores.  We need to think about what to do about the people who will inevitably be out of work.
#####
We can afford all kinds of things IF the rich payed their fair share. Also democracy dollars sounds genius.
#####
üòèü§îüòâHmmm...now how will Ying pay for his yang.ü§îüôÑüòÇ
#####
He"s got my vote.
#####
Universal Basic Income + Medicare for All = üí™üá∫üá∏
#####
Sanders/Yang or Yang/Gabbard 2020
#####
Need to mention student loan debt
#####
Hey, dumbfucks: the Republicans will never go along with UBI unless every social program--Medicare, school lunches, financial aid for college, SNAP, etc.--is eliminated. If you think those programs will remain AND they'll send you a $1,000 check every month, you're crazy.
#####
Go read up on UBI as explained on his website and have an understanding about it before commenting. It is really informative and interesting. Answers a lot of the questions raised in the comments below.

I really like this guy.
#####
Washing out corp money.  I wonder if tv ads could be considered time place or manner restrictions.equal time would be the only way to get on tv
#####
so they will do things like self checkout, which came out 20 years ago but never works.  Everyone gets in line instead because they know they will get a message that they need to get a checker, and by the time they do everyone else is done
#####
So... How does the government get this money üßêü§î?
#####
This idea is borrowed/plagiarized from political science.
The actual way that food stamps and welfare benefits are supposed to be implemented is to give that benefit to everyone. It is the most successful way to implement an anti poverty program and the only way to implement those programs that prevents the rightwing from trying to destroy and dismantle them.¬†

If you want the actual data on this, you would need to talk to a political science policy expert. Political scientist are the ones who actually scientifically investigate political policy and collect the empirical value on its cost and benefit. It's not economists.
#####
Wonderful
#####
I love it!  Let's do it!  Empower the people!
#####
It was generous of TYT to give this man some air time, but this is not a concept that American's are ready for. How about we start with an attainable goal like decent health care and affordable education.
#####

Andrew Yang talks about how to pay for it all on the Joe Rogan Experience
#####
Im for you #yang2020
#####
And people were bitching about AOC giving out money for people who don't work!  Well now you have a presidential hopeful whose running on this premise of giving 1000$ a month to everyone!  So suck on that guys!
#####
Andrew Yang for President 2020. Simple and short.
#####
Damn an extra 1000 a month. That would take me up to 8000 a month. Sweet. It would be my gun fund.
#####
Wow, I make less than that _and_ I have a fucking mortgage to pay!   I have no car and only have food thanks to food stamps.   It takes every last penny, every month, just to pay bills.   $150 extra dollars a month would be AMAZING!  I might be able to start making repairs on my poor house!
#####
He's going to need to talk about how exactly this is going to go down or he'll lose a lot of people. He's a smart guy on other policies.
#####
Ya RIGHT!
#####
I love that Yang mentioned how UBI is good for those doing the much-taken advantaged of realm of unpaid labor - the stay at home moms, the workers who can only do part-time work due to taking care of an elderly/sick relative, etc.  I don't think he'll make it too far this time around, but it's important to have these issues put forth at *some* point so that they can gain traction over time.
#####
I like this guy and I am going to check him out.
#####
Yang is spot on! It stimulated Alaska economy and saved many lives!
#####
We hang with Yang! Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
Too good to be true. Ill stick to my gut and help bernie get into where he belongs the office and restore what it means to be a president.
#####
Andrew Yang clearly identifies the causes that create the critical moment we are in.  Check out his other videos of talks & interviews on the role of the technological revolution that is much larger than the industrial revolution. He outlines ways that we can learn to adapt quickly. Thank you for introducing him!
#####
This is the change we needed in 2016 and hopefully get in 2020. Please no Average Joe.
#####
Just watched his campaign video and I like what you have to say.
#####
free money for everybody! free everything! nobody needs to work anymore!
#####
im for this, but i think we need to worry about medicare for all first, before anything else
#####
Ok, so far me it's either Bernie, Tulsi, and this guy. üíûüíû
#####
This guy is awesome!  I'm voting for him!
#####
I think the monthly income should be based on the cost of living for that region.
#####
This guy touched on the subjects of at least 2 TED Talks. One about a Canadian study on universal basic income and another about how poverty makes the impoverished focus on their short term needs instead of long term success. Watch out for this guy.
#####
Look up Secular Talk - Kyle Kulinski‚Äôs thorough analysis of Andrew Yang and Universal Welfare - it‚Äôs amazing. 
We need this.
#####
amazing guy
#####
This would be a permanent and effective economic stimulus. Instead of wasting billion's on a useless wall they should try this out for a year and see how it affects the economy. I bet it would be an incredible boost.
#####
Why not just cut taxes
#####
UBI is absolutely necessary due to the obvious facts pointed out by Mr. Yang, as well as the fact that we need to fundamentally reshape our entire monetary and economic systems to match the needs of ordinary people in today's world.  Also, UBI needs to be structured to be automatically adjusted to inflation.
#####
It would be great,.. until having $1000/mo was abject poverty
#####
I've heard Pakman mention Yang but I didn't look him up. I like.
#####
Do you need any families in Colorado? It makes sense, what he's saying! Go Yang 2020!
#####
What if the real estate market realizes that everyone has an extra thousand dollars and instead you end up enriching the real estate speculators?
#####
Dammmmm yang 2020
#####
I like the argument that ubi doesn't remove non Democratic power structures that have taken over capitalism
#####
We need to prevent our out of control corrupt capitalism from taking advantage of a universal income first. To make sure we aren't feeding Slum Lords in particular. Hopefully Yang has a vision for this, I'll be watching the debates. He's definitely a tie for my vote.
#####
A $1,000 UBI would be the best thing to ever happen to the American economy. The problem is people will either be too corrupt to let it happen or too dumb to understand its necessity in the long term. It isn't a matter of if it happens, but when it happens. Technology advancements combined with growing population will start to make the job market thinner and thinner. If the USA is the first major developed country to do a UBI at such a large scale, it would set a global precedent with America being ahead of the curve for once.
#####
That like to dislike ratio tho!!!!! #Yang2020
#####
And people get bent out of shape when so called black people ask for reparations. If u can give everyone 1k a month. Reparations suddenly does look so complicated ??ü§®
#####
if it came down to Warren or Yang. it's actually a tough call for me. i feel like Yang's ideas are interesting and i'd love to see them implemented.
#####
Why would Americans vote themselves out of slavery to the political police state?
#####
Name recognition will be the least of a factor than ever before in 2020 & that's even  if Biden & Bernie run. The former VP might be polling well but once he starts to open his mouth with centrist talking points, 3 people will get excited. And Bernie's 2016 policy proposals are the pretty much the litmus test. It would not surprise me if over 50% that make it to the debate stage will beat Trump. The pendulum only swung to the red because Hillary did not step one foot in the rust belt.
#####
I actually get what he's saying I really do.. People that get more money they spend more money which in turn grows the economy.. It's been done, it's being done as he stated in Alaska, I know China has $1.3B people and even they have better Healthcare so to say America cannot afford it, yes we can because it's already done.. I've never heard of this guy but I'm really liking what I'm hearing so far so we will see.... I'll say he's a whole lot better than Howard the Duck, I mean the coffee guy...
#####
stupidest idea ever.  apparently yang has no fuckin clue how much 1000 dollars is.  'durrr...  what.  thats 3 cups of coffee a day for a month.  right?  what.  huh?  derp.'
this idea is so fuckin stupid i cant even begin.  what made him decide that EVERYBODY needs 1000 dollars a month.  nobody needs 1000 dollars a month.
i know people who would quit their jobs, move in to the forest, and never be heard from again if you gave em 1000 dollars a month.  unfuckinbelievably stupid idea.
how bout we give people who have less than 500 a month...  umm...  enough to have 500 a month.  i know...  youre like...  'huh, what good would that do?"  thats because youre an idiot.
#####
The more I hear the more I like
#####
He's too smart and intelligent for the american ppl. Sorry
#####
Mr. Yang currently has no chance at president but I would support him in a more local race, and I would love to see him in a debate and on a larger platform.
#####
I have a couple of problems with UBI that I think need to be addressed. I do think that eventually it will become a necessity and is basically a natural step due to the rising influence of technology. However, isn't this basically a copout for corporations? I mean there is a reason that several CEO's support the idea. If everyone gets 1000$ a month they don't have to increase their wages because every time employees complain about not being able to survive the companies can blame it on the government. "Hey maybe the gov should raise your UBI check!" .¬†The biggest argument for raising the minimum wage is so that people can survive but that argument basically gets destroyed with the implication of UBI. I can see a future where wages become even more stagnant than they are now or I can even see the minimum wage being challenged as a concept. Afterall it was meant to provide a wage so someone can survive but how necessary is that if the gov is paying you every month? Also, does anyone know if other welfare programs would be effected by this?
#####
he wants to give EVERY Citizen 1000$ a month...uhm, you guys are like 100 trillion $ is dept or whatever, why not just work on lowering that instead.
#####
Just passing by and this grabbed my attention.
#####
i like this dude already
#####
I want Yang to be President.  I want my free money.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  Giving me an extra $12k a year will be MUCH better for the economy than horded by a billionaire.  And it would make my life better.
#####
It's really funny because I look at Universal Basic Income as a transition piece. it is just a matter of time before money is phased out. It really is NOT necessary to have money in this era of high tech. There's even giant 3D printers that can make houses with just a few people on the 'job site'.  And I'm glad he brought up GDP because if you see people's happiness and economic integrity compared to GDP, there is a direct inverse relationship. And it is especially annoying since politicians know how dumb a lot of people are and will site the growth of the GDP as if it means a GOOD thing for regular people.
#####
He needs to get Richard Ojeta as his running mate!
#####
It‚Äôs a well-known fact that people that have no money spend more money because they need to spend it for medical reasons and bills. That extra 1000 really isn‚Äôt a lot, and will most likely be spent. It will circulate the money in our economy. Instead of it all being in bank accounts overseas.
#####
Don't forget about universal basic housing...
#####
This will be a good idea when  we speed up automation and AI development.
#####
It's the most rational concept of new economy. Watch Rutger Bregman on YouTube. When your basic needs are met, you will be productive for society as a whole. Purpose.
#####
Yang 2020 will happen if we make it happen! Let me know if you want to start a local Yang chapter or head over to his website to donate $1 to help Yang hit 65,000 unique donors to get on the debates! Let's believe in people together! #HumanityFirst
#####
Yang has really a point. It is neither the immigrants nor the cheap labor overseas who's killing your job. The technology makes you redundant. What should all the people do that are replaced by automation, robots and computers? It looks like they will not learn to code.
#####
Sounds the same as Trump. The difference is that he wants to give all the morons the basic income and be happy, because automation is coming anyway. IT darling.
#####
How can you attack further issues without addressing current problems.
#####
They finally ran polls again and he's up from 5% to 8%. So much for the DNC trying to keep him off the debate stage to try and boost Amy Klobuchar.

I think his idea about BUI people won't really think about it until the 2040's after the jobs are all gone.
#####
If one receives a check for social security disability, or food stamps, one may not receive the $1,000.00 freedom dividend,. One may not receive both, it's one of the other.
     If one receives a social security retirement check, you Will receive two checks, you will receive the retirement check and the freedom dividend, both.
     It's about time someone honored and rewarded senior citizens by forcing them to receive the extra $1,000.00 per month, for as long as they live for all the suffering and working they did all of their lives.
     God bless our seniors and best wishes to you and your families.
#####
The establishment fears a man like Yang. He's a loving father and faithful husband with no scandals. And he's so engaging and likeable because he's genuine and sincere. Yeah they will seek to ignore him and when they can't they will play dirty

Once again having white privilege must be very nice

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!

OK I'm voting for yang no questions ask
#####
I can't wait for Trump to attack Yang on Twitter or social media in general. The #yangGang always comes through Donny, don't you forget it.
#####
My problem with Yang, who I like, is that he does not democratize the workplace. At the end of the day, the Freedom Dividend is welfare and although it would help a lot, it does not take on the power imbalances that create all this suffering. Also therefore: Bernie2020

The Hillary and Trump debate was like two kids fighting at the playground. Yang will destroy Trump in a debate. Trump has no scientific research, no statistics and no MATH on his side, just emotional hogwash; on the other hand, Andrew Yang proposes real solutions to everyday problems: cyber-security, A.I., healthcare, household income, proper tax system, and much more. If you don't vote Andrew Yang then you have officially given Trump the Win.

Andrew Yang, you won't have a chance just because you are Chinese. Are you smart ? Yes, I think you are probably the smartest candidate. Unfortunately, you are in a country where prejudice and unrecognizing of intelligence dominates the society.  Skin color and looks are way more important than intelligence and policies to Americans. Good luck to your andeavor !
#####
Today I changed my independent status to democrat to caucus for Yang in Iowa; 2-3-2020.
#####
they did not do a good job covering yangs points. Because that 2 trillion dollar bill will actually be put back into the economy and cycled by lower income of people. This is because 1000 dollars is more valuable to a lower income family rather than a 1% would put in the bank. Yang can change alot in a progressive and positive way! Yang 2020!!

Yang isn't a "color" he's an honorary-white at the least, and he's very wealthy, he's close to Wall-Street and people like Bill Gates and Mark Face Book.  Yang is a corporate Stalinist Trojan-Horse, and anti-progressive, he's neoliberal part of the problem and only a solution for the shareholder class.
#####
So much information and so fewer views... I am shocked
#####
The following comment is for anyone to politely inform me about: UBI (Universal Basic income) seems like a fantastic idea, and feel like I could be onboard with it. One of the things that bothers me greatly is the 2 Trillion dollar price tag. So my question is, if I were to vote for him (if he makes it to the general election) and UBI, why would I? And wouldn't this be putting us even more in debt? 
       Sincerely, 
       A 19 year old looking to be informed for this election

Ok guys, time to step it up. We need more people that are politically disengaged to learn about Yang. We have the power to do this.

ATTENTION YANGGANG 2020! I am a volunteer for Andrew and we need support right now in Iowa and New Hampshire! There are many ways you can help: donations of even just a few dollars, volunteering (phone banking and text banking right from your own home!) and canvassing. We are only 6 days away from the Iowa caucus, success at these polls will allow Yang to peak at the right time and gain attention from voters across the nation. I urge you to donate or sign up as a volunteer here:¬†https://www.yang2020.com/

The White House needs an intelligent man like Andrew Yang.
#####
Anybody who claims Yang is a democrat should just read this cheering section of trump supporters.
#####
Can people please stop saying the UBI is for "everyone"? You're deducting that amount from the neediest people. When you keep repeating that, it's like those aren't real people. They're invisible as far as Yang is concerned.
#####
Andrew makes the main stream Looking stupid! Good job, time to wake up America that it‚Äôs controlled by the 20% of the population and the 80% have to wake up and follow Yang!

Please let this guy win!!!

I've been struggling for a long time and if this guy gives me 1k a month.

I can go to college

You can‚Äôt just pull magic money out of the air it doesn‚Äôt work that way businesses will raise prices now that people have ‚Äúmore money‚Äù or else they are actually losing money. You can‚Äôt run for president and not even posses a basic understanding of the economy
#####
You don't need to raise money to be President, just buy people's vote for $1000 a month using their own money. Oh, and free health care. I'm just waiting for my free car. This guy is a genius.

This news of Macys closing more stores in 2020 didn't surprise me after listening to what Yang said. He is right, Amazon is sucking away $$$ from businesses and local malls across the country.   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-reportedly-closing-more-dozen-221109460.html

Amazon paid zero dollars in taxes ?

who is this idiot that is interviewing Andrew Yang?

4-5 weeks without a quality poll. DNC is at its old habit again #Pollthepeople

Yang has the freshest ideas. He is talking 21st AND 22nd century solutions when all the rest are back in 2010!  Man I hope everyone really gives this man a hard look.  I did and I just can‚Äôt un-see what I‚Äôve learned.  He is the person to lead this country in the massive disruptive changes to come. The Joe Rogan Interview goes into details, highly recommend.
#####
More info:
https://youtu.be/IOWP_JJvPdA
#####
I think he is right. Another advantage of this will be that Americans become richer and those who come from outside illegal will be poor because of inflation. And every American will be a shareholder of those biggest companies. And the people who came to US illegal won‚Äôt afford the costs therefore instead of legalizing them to USA. US has to come up with secondary citizenship like Saudi Arabia does with different Arab countries when they pour in. They don‚Äôt give them  citizenship but permanent residency. So they have to stay at permanent resident status instead of getting citizenship. Since government cares more about their citizen and give them more money and because of the inflation it will drive illegals away making them poor and letting them go back their countries. Just like if you don‚Äôt have social security then you don‚Äôt get benefits and privileges.
#####
Think about it who will pay the 1k per person probably hyper inflation like in Zimbabwe.
#####
If this was true I will def vote for him. I can buy my house for my family.
#####
Do yourself a favor and see how Yang deals with pressure from the media https://youtu.be/RrF7qdFP2Qc

Cool, but how about the fact he doesn‚Äôt support Medicare for all based on his website versus his platform? Proof https://youtu.be/RrF7qdFP2Qc
#####
Funny Richard Nixon wanted to do the same thing in the 1970s, by using tax credits. 
His biggest opposition came from Democrats, as the tax credit would only go to people who worked and paid taxes.

Now he is only giving it to 10 families.

Am confused. You want to give 1000 a month. Who is going to pay for that! Think with your head! Let‚Äôs see your lowered tax will be increased again? Welcome inflation. He should sit down!
#####
The reason so many Silicon Valley millionaires are behind UBI is very simple. As robotics increasingly replace workers in Amazon warehouses or fast food restaurants and as self driving technology will replace the millions of uber and Lyft drivers all these workers will need to be laid off. So according to today‚Äôs rules amazon and the other companies would have to bear a burden of these unemployment benefits. However if the UBI is offered then no unemployment benefits would need to be paid. So the burden gets shifted from these companies that laid off these workers to the tax payers. Get it.
#####
He's got the math
#####
Straight up concrete answers, God bless Andrew Yang, let's set the example for the rest of the world and make him the man in charge!

I dont get involved in politics but if this dude gets nominated for President. He has my vote. Only if he gets nominated.

We got this guys the biggest thing is to SPREADING THE WORD, tell your friends, family, co workers EVERYONE about Andrew Yang, we need to get his man in the white house, not just for us but for our kids and their future.
#####
Danm why are people so afraid of trying something new. He is right $1000.00 is not that much money and people especially young would spend it. Which would keep the malls open.
#####
This isn't possible economically guys.. dont vote, it will never happen :(
#####
This dude had an answer to every single question almost immediately, plus he seems to have a balance between humor (how he introduced himself) and seriousness. Best candidate we've had in years.

Besides ubi, Andrew Yang seems the most sensible democratic candidate
#####
Man, we need this man to be president in Taiwan! Our country is becoming a shit show right now, thank you president üñï
#####
Dear Mr. Yang. I really hope America does the right thing and makes you president. If not, it is their loss and Canada would welcome you with open arms to make you our prime minister.
#####
What people who are against ubi don't understand is he didn't instantly go "1k to everybody!" If you watch the podcast between him and Joe Rogan said he has gone through several tests before he came to the conclusion of 1k a month.
#####
How is 12k gonna change your life when you lose your job? 

It wont. But it might help people not take their lives while they get back on track in this new economy. Suicide rates are at the highest they've been.

Tough questions. Clear, excellent answers.
#####
I feel like this is going to cause inflation...and not just on education, housing, and healthcare like he mentioned. If people know you got an extra $1k a month, any kind of business would raise their prices knowing you now have more disposable income. And how are they going to afford $1k to everybody? Additional taxes?? Hasn't there been simulations of this online in the past? :S
#####
Hello Yang Gang!! we have come so far. The fight is no where near over!

This extra $1K a month will help me put that money into my long term investments. Google Phil Town - Rule #1 he can help you with value investing free 3day transformational course. #Yang2020 #Rule1 #PhilTown #MATH

#####
i looked over his policies he really just a goat vote for him ong!!!!
#####
This is the worst thing that could happen to America. 

This is just more government control in our lives.  Can't you see where this is going?  If this man had his way, income tax would be 100%.  That's right, 100% of your check would go to the government. 

Now once the government has your money, they will "redistribute" the money to everyone, based on need.

This is classic Marxism.  Everyone puts in what they can, and gets back what they need, and the government will decide what you need.  If you are a doctor or lawyer, you will be able to put in alot more than others, but you will get out no more than anyone else.   If you don't make much money, you will put in very little, but get out the same as anyone else. 

So, gone then would be any incentive to work, any incentive to better yourself, because even though you are able to generate more income, you will not benefit from it.

Sooner or later, no one has any incentive to work, and when no more money is coming into the government, the government runs out of other people's money, and your entire economic system collapses. 

Marxism is from Karl Marx.  This is where Hitler got alot of his ideas...
#####
This Lang guy is social communist I think. How does he propose to give everyone over 18 a 1000 dollars a month? Half of the folks getting 1000 dollars a month will spend it on weed and beer and likely strip clubs....this guy acts like people are going to spend the money wisely like going to school or creating an IRA, nope the vast majority will travel, waste it on technology and video game applications; then it will be something like, crying babies saying that 1000 dollars a month isn't enough , youll open their homes and there will be hundreds of packages of amazon shipped crap that was made in china in their homes , while they don't work, and say they need 2000 dollars a month not a 1000, while complaining that they cant get a job because they blah blah blah reasons for why but theyre just lazy or not being living within their means;
          and its a carrot he's dangling in front of immature people who are of course going to say yeah Ill vote for him because loyalty can yes be bought...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..just ask a six year old which parent they love if theyed give them 10lbs of candy a month and, one watch how fat and spoiled they get , and two they ll never get the 1000 because no one gives out anything for free, believe me someone will pay, hes prob planning on bankrupting current social security treasury to fuck the elderly so young millennials and gen y and z can have new cells every year plus free data......If you don't work hard to get what you want you will be spoiled and the last two generations for the most part don't really know how to do anything that isn't digital and have grossly exaggerated expectations of what they are worth against folks who have already been in the work fields for decades, most without a refined skillset.....give them a 1000 dollars a month and they ll loaf around believe me and more jobs they don't want to do will go to visa bearing workers who will just spend the money in their families homes outside of the USA economic system,  he is solidly a socialist or communist at heart I think;
                and if not an idea like giving people 1000 dollars a month will never happen, its an empty promise to get him elected he will never deliver plus an extremely unrealistic and poorly thought out plan for economic foundation strengthening.  Do you honestly still believe in fairy tales ???????
#####
Be thankful enough USA because there are people trying to save you the best that they can given the fact the reason why your country is  like a full of idiots most expecially in your government nothing to blame your people itself. Will you please stop treating people like an animal... And never ever imitate those people has a skillful and talented and at the end this people end up is the one to blame... Putang ina niyo wag ako!!! Marami kayong violations under social progress as a human being i have the rights to live, choose the best not only for me for my family, stop suppression act of aggression just to follow whatever you want it to do in favor to your own country.

AMAZON DID NOT PAY 0 IN TAXES.... they did write-offs. If they owed 1 billion in taxes, that meant that they spent close to 3 or 4 billion on pro-america write-offs such as charity donations, paying for employee education, building city infrastructure near their locations, etc. Amazon (american businesses) is not the enemy. Ironically... this is all simple math.
#####
To all you posters intelligent enough to know that Yang is the best candidate, I commend you. 

Andrew Yang for president!!!!
#####
$3.27 trillion in handouts every month? Yeah, we would be at civil war over food and water in a number of days of this ‚Äúplan‚Äù being in effect. Yet again more proof of DemoRats and LibTards trying to deliberately take down our country and start a civil war.
#####
Where is the money gonna come from for every American to get 1k a month?????
#####
The DNC are devil worshippers dealing in the art of dark math, distorting the truth.. Jedi Yang is trying to save humanity with  good numbers and enlighten us with the mathematical truths.
#####
This makes no sense giving everyone 1k a month will just raises prices on everything to accommodate that. This is economics 101 how do presidential candidates not understand this. All this will achieve is increasing inflation. More money being given to Americans means the value of businesses products will go down and they can‚Äôt afford that so to make up for it they will raise their prices.
#####
When Yang was asked about how his freedom dividend wouldn't cause rampant inflationary pressure, he cited how M2 Money supply more than doubled after 2008 and didn't cause any inflation then, but failed to mention that it came from the federal reserve buying Government bonds to suppress interest rates to keep the economy afloat. So none of that money actually went into the real economy its sitting on the Feds balance sheet.

Now lets do some napkin-math. M1 money supply in the US is currently 3.9 Trillion Dollars (M1 is the money supply that is composed of physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers' checks, other checkable deposits). Population is 327 Million. 327000000 people*1000/month*12months a year is 3.924 TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR going straight into the M1 money supply. Andrew Yang's freedom dividend will DOUBLE US M1 money supply within its first year

Since 1976, M1 has grown at a CAGR of 5.64% and inflation has grown at a CAGR of 3.57% if we assume a 0.63 long run correlation between M1 growth and inflation (3.57/5.64) The freedom dividend will bring the US CPI inflation rate to 63% (100%M1 increase*0.63 correlation)

Now Google Search "Hyperinflation"
#####
Giving ppl doesn‚Äôt teach them tho. If I gave my 24 yr old sister who‚Äôs unemployed a $1000 a month she‚Äôs not going to save it or pay debt off. She‚Äôs going to go buy a new purse, or go out party.. she‚Äôs just going to spend it. We need to start holding corporations accountable with paying taxes. Disney at the end of the day pays zero taxes.. that‚Äôs a problem we should start with instead of giving the poor uneducated unemployed a $1000 a month ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
#####
$3.2 billion handed out by the government every month. Is this guy a lunatic? We as a country would go bankrupt in under 2 weeks of him in office. America literally won‚Äôt be America anymore because of this plan. We would be turned into a 3rd world nation in a matter of weeks if not days. People who believe in his $1,000 a month for all plan are gullible morons.
#####
Everyone saying 1k a month you got my vote yet nobody ever asks where the money is coming from. People that believe in his plan are a joke to society. Pandering at its finest. Bribery at its finest. Do you people that believe in his plan even know how much billions would have to be handed out by the government every month for it to work? We as a country would go bankrupt in under 1 month. Not even a single payment would be able to get given.
#####
We all know this dumbass ain‚Äôt gonna make the primaries

The US will greatly benefit if they make this man president. All of humanity, in fact.

Did in 1800 USA , did they give out free money.     No.  

If you don‚Äôt work , no free money.  Our country grew for 150 years without welfare and we grew to the #1 country in the world.

Solar power is CHEAPER! Electric vehicles will soon be CHEAPER to build and already are much cheaper to operate, even more so when you charge from your own solar power. Education for all is a NO-BRAINER of an investment. Universal healthcare along with medical professionals with zero education debt is CHEAPER. A universal basic income replacing thousands of individual existing federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc along with all of their inefficiencies and overhead expenses is CHEAPER.

As a Republican, Andrew yang was the best candidate the democratic had and I may have voted for him.

How about we just get Trump to give us this and we have the best of both worlds.
If this is so important and if Yang does not win then he would be committing a crime to not unfold his idea with Trump and get it pushed to be done.
#####
HE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!!! THOUGH I AM NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, BUT, I STAND BY YOU!!! YANG!
#####
Democracy dont work so good when the education of the average voter is so poor. People act like the partys are their sports teams when they should be listening to what these people are proposing and how likely they are to follow through and their promises. Yang gang. Bernie. Gabbard. All phenomenal candidates
#####
The thing with debates is that it strikes people's emotions and most candidates market themselves in the emotional grip and don't actually offer a strategic effective and logical plan that is innovative and for the 21st century. In contrast, Yang is speaking solutions and keeping calm in emotions like he's actually done some work and communicating his plan while the other candidates eat off their own social reputation and market themselves to get major emotive "American pride" points that really don't do much than to rile up people hot-headed instead of seeking a logical and clear minded perspectives on solutions. Idk debates get too emotive that the candidates get swayed too much into ego, rep, market, etc that feed to their own audience egos which really is an unfair debate to get their audience in that way. What for if an emotional response is momentary and not always the best route to debate on serious issues and create solutions. You can't think and speak clearly on with too much right brain or left brain, there needs to be a balance and control in emotions and logic of most of these debates. In all honesty, that alone tells a candidate's personality and sneak peek to their presidential behavior. Looking at them all, Yang seems to know his stuff and clearly states his solutions. Direct, clear, and smart is what the 21st century needs with a nation that runs too far into emotive pride and response especially with the increase in tech. We need a new approach for America.
#####

There are 209,000,000 people in America 18 and over. $1000 for each of those individuals equates to 209 billion per month added to an already broke government.


Will this $1000 be for every adult, or does the benefit go away after a certain income level?
#####
the only vice he have is that he is pro abortion
and dont think a man don't have any input on the decision of the women to kill a baby

OMG That one thousand a month entitlement made sense to me. Until I wrote this and now I reckon inflation would soon wipe out the value of that afore mentioned thousand  dollars 
 But it's all irrelevant. Yet it is it's shade of irrelevancy that makes all so plausible for me. 
 It doesn't matter because first the tax laws that allow companies making as much money as Amazon to pay so little back to America in proportion to their tax paid vs their money made.
#####
As a Canadian watching this Yang is the only one that speaks with facts. The rest speak with BS and whatever Americans will allow them to say ie Joe Biden ‚Äúwe will cure cancer‚ÄùüôÑ

"a trickle up economy"!!! $1000 "given" a month per adult... by adding taxes on the taxpayers. Great plan.

Why not this dude buy us a good health insurance for each of us 1000k will buy very good plan and health problem solved in America .i do not get it he is not able to deliver universal health care for all but able to give us 1k

IS THERE A GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD ACTUALLY PASS THIS? We have been lied to for over 30 years... theres been too many broken empty promises...

You can raise a lot of that "universal income" by charging and CONVICTING crooks like the Trump family...who, along with their accomplices, (McConnell, Mnuchin, Jordan, and most of the GOP) have had their arms shoulder deep in the U.S. treasury since they put this sham administration together. You then SEIZE every f***ing penny they've stolen, leaving the members of their families that DON'T end up in prison DESTITUTE like they deserve to be. It's time to put an end to the billionaires brainwashing and stranglehold on this country's wealth! Like Bernie said, TAX THEM OUT OF EXISTENCE! Time to hand the control over to brilliant minds that want a better life for ALL at the expense of the ELITE FEW instead of assholes like Trump that want a better life for the ELITE FEW at the expense of ALL!
#####
Well I am voting for yang if he is giving me 1k a month no cap
#####
I like his ideas but this will cause our value of money to deteriorate and cause inflation
#####
Pure communism. Mr. Trump lock this traitor up!
#####
needs to be 3000 monthly. than ill vote
#####
u get the 1k only if u let yang cream in ur mouth
#####
This seems like bull.
#####
Tldw; basically just more taxes.
#####
Everybody vote yang pls. I'm sure we could all use that 1000 dollars.
#####
*Spolier* It won't.
#####
He actually wants to give between one and two thousand dollars per person. Must you prove citizenship to receive free $48,000 per year for a family of four?
#####
Amazon, who you want to tax does not add value to products. They are retailers.
#####
So flooding the economy with 3 trillion in liquid cash is going to change the price of groceries, gas, water, rent, etc... I'm not hearing an analysis that addresses this point. Will 1000 a month feel more like 400 a month? Small businesses will be hit on both ends. They will have to offer higher salaries to entice workers. They will lose customers with higher prices. Amazon can afford to charge less for several years, effectively putting small businesses in the red. I recognize my fears may be unjustified so i'm open to an explanation.
#####
Yang is the Yoda of today‚Äôs view of economic standpoint
#####
Wouldnt this just cause inflation?
#####
The problem with taxing big tech companies like Amazon is that they will just pass on the expense to the consumer so the $1,000 per person will get eaten up by the price increases each company will do to cover for their taxes. Inflation could skyrocket.
#####
$1000 a month is alot and will put Americans back on their feet.
#####
It scares me for society that people watched this clip and thought: now THERES a smart candidate. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#####
You‚Äôre right. He speaks with data. Data on policies that will lead to national bankruptcy. I appreciate that he doesn‚Äôt use emotional anecdotes and instead uses actual data. This way we are POSITIVE that he‚Äôs an idiot. We don‚Äôt just FEEL like he‚Äôs an idiot. Refreshing
#####
The reason so many Silicon Valley millionaires are behind UBI is very simple. As robotics increasingly replace workers in Amazon warehouses or fast food restaurants and as self driving technology will replace the millions of uber and Lyft drivers all these workers will need to be laid off. So according to today‚Äôs rules amazon and the other companies would have to bear a burden of these unemployment benefits. However if the UBI is offered then no unemployment benefits would need to be paid. So the burden gets shifted from these companies that laid off these workers to the tax payers. Get it.
#####
This guy will take our country to poverty. The number will not add. Giving people free money is agains the bible giving people hight pay jobs or better oportunities will give people more then 1,000 dollars. Giving people free money is promoting people to not work. I will not work for someone also.
#####
Andrew Yang has done his homework he brings facts and logic and wants to put people above profits .  I'm not an American but live in Canada what happens in your nation will effect us in some ways too,  It's 2019 soon 2020 a new way of thinking and doing things is what we as people need to explore in order to move forward for the benefit of everybody.
#####
He manage to make the most out of the 2 mins speaking time they gave him imagine if they gave hime 15- 20 mins just like the other candidates
#####
Thats completely flawedü§£ü§£ you give people 1000 a month to many people would get comfortable and not work at all. Its pretty simple
#####
Yang will never be President
#####
NBC gave the man 2 minutes and the hardest question to answer, and he ripped that interviewer a new one
#####
This is Bernie #NoRefunds all over again.
#####
It's just one nutcase running after another on that stage. I have never seen such a rogue's gallery in my life. Just plain nuts!
#####
As a Trump fan I say Yang has the best shot against Trump because he speaks with logic while the others speak with emotion and stupidity
#####
So wadda deh gonna spend it on? yur tax?!?! What a ridiculous question
#####
ANDREW ANDREW ANDREW
#####
I like yang, but my question is, how would he INITIALLY pay for the 1k a month before the long term revenue increases are seen? Someone explain?
#####
Free 1k a month plus my work check would actually let me afford get a place of my own.
#####
I swear if he teams with Biden üòî
#####
To think my mother supports Elizabeth Warren over him.
#####
Ok guys, time to step it up. We need more people that are politically disengaged to learn about Yang. We have the power to do this. I'm going to start carrying Yang cards and put them under windshield wipers at every parking lot I got to. I think if more of us do this it can have a huge impact on getting the word out.

I am a conservative Trump supporter would have supported him 2020 too he's done so much and taken so much action did you know after the tariffs he made on China they just went through a phase 1 deal with each other Trump did that, North Korea is no longer shooting missiles over Japan Trump did that,  his first action was trying to create more coal mining jobs, a campaign promise, He tried to build a wall key words being tried, I love how everyone is quick to bash him when every campaign promise he has made he has tried or taken action on.  Now my point on this was I hate PC culture and democrats with their race card BS, but yang is the first democrat who has ever gotten my respect and not just my respect many more conservatives have taken a liking to him if the left media stops trying to shut him down in the debates and msnbc a major democratic media outlet gives him the due coverage he deserves he would be ranking much higher in the polls., he has appeared on many conservative and left media outlets and even made a very intellectual debate against Ben Shapiro Yang is the reason I watched the democratic debates and although I respect what trump has taken action on I Respect yang even more for thinking about real future issues, and thinking logically unlike most democratic candidates I've listened too Also look at the Hong Kong protests they all asked for trumps help and after he signed legislature to help them they all thanked him with signs and waving the american flags in HONG KONG. I'm 21 btw.
#####
Another candidate exploiting the lesser educated populationü§® Amazon is not paying as much tax because they are reinvesting heavily back into the economy to get growth. On the other hand, Apple is not paying tax because they are using loopholes to send money out of US. US unemployment rate is at an all-time low because companies need people. They certainly don't have Yang's imaginary robot that does all the worküòÇ

$1000 in my hands. The POINT here is "in my hands". US govt spent $708K this year to get zebrafish addicted to nicotine! $22 mil to study the connection between getting boozed up and ending up in an ER. Because apparently nobody ever saw the connection. The list goes on... Trickle down economy is a sham! I don't give a shit about zebrafish and I never saw a penny of that wasted money trickle down into my hands! Finally, a candidate who really sees through the ton of shit clogging our political system and our bureaucracy, shuffled through bullshit policies like the "wealth tax" which the wizards of conglomerate accounting can figure out to evade on any given lunch break, and who's zeroed in on the only pressure point that Amazons and Googles will respond to by coughing up their dollars. It's not perfect, but it's the best we got, the Value Added Tax. Because worse comes to worst, they can pack up, shit all over the wealth tax and leave America, but they can't leave us, their customers to avoid the VAT. I know it's a self-bleed move in part, but isn't that expected when you're going for that knock out punch against the big guys?

America is not ready for this type of  intelligent leadership... emotional anecdotes , industry puppets  that's the waY ... the Donald Trump way ... the DNC way (No different!!)
 A massively growing economy needs to always believe and entrust its citizens as the prime investment Andrew Yang does this
#####
As stupid as it sounds , Taylor Swift has 123 Million followers. . If we can get aswift to endorse Yang . We would get the surge Ariana Grande got for Bernie. Or at very least the coverage we need , then Yang will at least have an actual fair chance to be heard! Js
#####
Conservative here. UBI is crazy and scary, but might be unavoidable in the light of automation.  This is plunging into unknown territory and I‚Äôll even assume that Yang has done his research as a courtesy.  We still don‚Äôt know what would happen, and it‚Äôs dangerous to be so foolhardy about such a fundamental and massive change to life.  It might not work out well, but it is an experiment we may have no choice but to run or risk economic and social collapse with automation job losses in a rapidly out of date economic system.  

I have a terrible vision of a society which has transitioned to a UBI with moderate success.  And everything goes along ok until the next financial collapse.  And then those in power realize we can‚Äôt afford to sustain everyone.  Either we need to cut the basic income for some, or for all.  And the thing is it will makes far more sense to cut it for those who don‚Äôt contribute to society. And who knows in what shape ‚Äòcut it‚Äô might take?  Throwing those who never worked onto the streets?  Sterilization?  Extermination?  In a secular world human beings have no intrinsic value.  Some clever and ruthless leader will connect the dots and realize it makes financial and environmental sense to cull the number of the least performing people in a society where large numbers of people - maybe even the majority - aren‚Äôt contributing anything useful to society and just use.  And also have no means to defend themselves from tyranny, as they can‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds them.
#####
I like his thought, but I still believe a lot of the people receiving that money are going to waste it on stupid nonsense. I‚Äôm a college student. I know. Personally, I‚Äôd save the majority of that money and spend very little, perhaps, even use some to help pay my college... but I bet you the majority of people are going to BLOW that 12k a year and then come begging to the government for more help.

I am not affiliated with any political party, but Andrew Yang is Democrats' best shot at beating Donald Trump. To defeat a wild card, you need a wild card. Any traditional politicians won't have a chance against Donald Trump because the negative public opinion on these traditional politicians is what got him in office in the first place. Trump has already defeated a female candidate in the election so I do not think this will be the year of electing our first Mrs. President. This leaves Andrew Yang. Although I am not so sure about public opinion on a Taiwanese-American candidate. However, the fact that Yang is one of the leaders in the fundraising race shows that the public is acceptive of a non-White president. We shall see, 2020 should be a fun election year.

#####
My understanding UBI is for any US citizen 18 yrs and over... especially seniors.
#####
And if u don't need the money, donate it to the people that need it.
#####
In these times of intellectual blindness and emotional irrationality it becomes important that Reason should not be abandoned.
I sincerely believe Andrew Yang is a reasonable problem solver. If he were to promise, pander or mislead one without taking a factual and logical approach a solution would unlikely occur. Unlike most politicians he is interested in solutions that can produce results. Most politicians motives revolve around their Ego and Lust for power, they will do and say what the voters want to hear to solicit their vote. After all that is said and done the Status Quo will remain. Now Let use some reason to champion UBI (Freedom Dividend). UBI is a practical solution to a factual problem.

Can we all agree that the Trickle Down Economy Myth needs to be completely Destroyed and never seen again. It's obvious that it is not wise and relies on GREEDY CAPITALISTS to reinvest in human labor when the bottomline is to maximize profits. Generally the quickest way to effect the profit margin is to chop down human labor to show favorable numbers to increase the companies stock price. This is the reality that motivates corporations to sustain and raise the funds to operate and grow. Human labor becomes the volitile element that occupies a large percentage of the profit margin. It would stand to reason that if given the means to replace the human labor element with robotics and automation it would be in place immediately. Robotics and automation are consistent with predictable performance numbers and can be run non stop; unlike a human being whom would need to rest and recover.

Here are the facts: Corporations, Businessman and the WEALTHY ARE NOT JOB CREATORS!!! CUSTOMERS ARE!! No Business or Corporation can exist without CUSTOMERS or Clients. You may have the Greatest Products or Services and it still will not make a difference without CUSTOMERS. Guess what if people CANNOT AFFORD your goods or services? You are Guaranteed to go OUT OF BUSINESS! Henry Ford understood this over a hundred years ago. If he paid his employees a high enough wage then in turn they will have means to purchase one of the cars they are producing. This ensured the survival of his business. Ford saw this as an investment which he would recover a large portion of that wage back to him.

Okay Everyone it's time took look at UBI for what it really represents: LEVERAGE! Everything revolves around the concept of LEVERAGE. Leverage is the SUPER POWER that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry MORE with LESS. The UBI (Freedom Dividend) really represents LEVERAGE. The $1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage their situation. Once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum. As we know leverage is the key ingredient that reduces the energy needed to overcome resistance. This effect MINIMIZES the probability of placing the burden on others. Some people like Chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery, essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage. Their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain. As everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times. This leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level. So the LARGER the GAP the more extreme the leverage becomes. The GREATEST Leverage is held by those of Hoarded Generational wealth.

Those whom are the descendants and beneficiaries of inherited wealth are The Primary group which has Stigmatized Welfare and UBI for generations. They purposely Stigmatize and cast shame on those in poverty. And what is truly disgusting is they draw pleasure from cruelly denying any form of assistance and actively work to humiliate one in order to strip them of their Human Dignity. This is due to the psychological sub-conscious projection of their own GUILT for receiving funds by BIRTHRIGHT instead of through MERIT!

Other than those Entitled Pricks there is no good reason to oppose UBI if you are a Company or Businessman. They are the ones who stand to benefit the most from UBI Because it increases the means for patrons to purchase what they are peddling. It is a true investment in the Economy rather than giving Wealthy Pricks TAX BREAKS and SUBSIDIES which ultimately causes damage to the economy by extracting the currency from circulating. It becomes hoarded and extracted, placed in an account offshore in a tax shelter. This extracted currency cannot generate anything but more Leverage sitting in a bank account. It is taken out circulation and cannot generate taxes and sales needed for a strong economy. It is Beyond Short SIGHTED to oppose UBI and favor those whom already posess Extreme levels of Leverage.

A greater WEALTH GAP will only cause DESPERATION and ANXIETY which will build even greater Economic Instability setting the conditions for Criminal behavior. A ticking time bomb which will have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of Civil Unrest. GREED AND SELFISHNESS will Blind them from the Obvious. The Obvious move is you will receive a greater amount of wealth if it is spread out and not concentrated. Otherwise, if concentrated you would be choking and Killing the Golden Goose preventing it from continuing to lay it's golden eggs. It would be much wiser to feed and look out for the Gooses best interest, you will be rewarded with a flow of Golden Eggs

Can anyone deny that $1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling. To teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind. In Fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching. And for the growing homeless population across this country, what could $1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job. Raising the Minimum Wage will not even come close to the impact of a $1000 a month will do. If fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee. This helps both Business owner and consumer by providing more money in hand to support that business with patronage.

The biggest criticism to UBI is the cost. Again this is SHORT SIGHTED blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board. Starting with the release of pressure and Anxiety that SCARCITY brings. It allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of ABUNDANCE instead of scarcity. With a SCARCITY Mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials. Not to mention the burden that Stress related illnesses caused by a Scarcity mindset places on the healthcare industry driving up higher healthcare costs. A Scarcity mindset effects businesses with LESS Patronage and taxes generated to pay for programs such as UBI. A population that is less financially desperate creates less need to commit crimes, which in turn creates a lesser burden on law enforcement and incarceration. When one is incarcerated it cost real money to feed and house them, this will only become a lesser burden on the tax payer to sustain the institution. This is an inevitable fact when Economic DESPAIR becomes magnified it starts a domino effect that crimes becomes a reality.
Desperation creates the mindset of: "if I have nothing than I have nothing to lose". The cost and burden to society would be multiple times that of the alternative of ensuring a living wage.

Just ponder the following thoughts and facts. What impact could the millions of dollars raised and used to run for President do if it were applied to healthcare, UBI or even applied to essentail services? It is obscene to see it wasted in the pursuit of public office.

Let's get some perspective of how obscene extreme hoarded wealth really is:
Suppose you had $1-billion. You could spend $5,000 a day for more than 500 years before you would run out of money.

Breaking it down even farther, it means you would have to spend over $100,000 every day for the next 25 years in order to spend $1-billion.

I love Yang and his Gang, but! Yang is calling out the jobs lost, and we get from Yang and Obama here recently that America needs to be creative in thoughts of jobs. I‚Äôm disappointed we aren‚Äôt being told from leaders that are supposed to be ‚ÄúSo Smart‚Äù what those jobs will be. If you want to have solutions and not creative thought, you might get elected. Average Joe might do better as leaders of the super smart have no Solutions. Creative though. I don‚Äôt get that, Creative thought means YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

there is still one.. one who can bring balance to the nation. It has been nearly 4 years since the Russian bots attacked. It seems the last president vanished in a time when the world needed him most. But my brother and I have found a new candidate, and I believe, Yang can save the world

Thanks for sharing and  covering Andrew Yang!
#####
If the internet is fueling Yang, how come he's still doing poorly in the polls? Just because you have a lot of support online doesn't mean you'll experience success at the ballot box.


Things can change and I'll admit I'm wrong should I be wrong about my prediction, but I feel like Yang will be the 2020 version of Ron Paul. Support from both sides of the political spectrum, not given the spotlight on TV or during debates, mass internet support, but I feel like the online noise won't translate into votes.

I am really digging Andrew Yangs vision and ideas. he introduces interesting concepts while encouraging people to think for themselves before fulling believing in him, and that's what it is all about, think for yourselves, don't be sheeps. I just wanna comment specifically on the topic of automation, the more I do my own research and really pay attention to my surroundings, the more I realize the effect of automation. I work as a commercial electrician and one of our department specializing in automation controls. we install, maintain and program industrial machinery, and after listening to what Mr. Yang, I reflected on my own experience, I really do see computer taking over repetitive jobs, here's are some work I've personally was part of over the past years, we've installed touch screen kiosk in a couple of restaurants and it is only becoming more popular, we also did self check out at a local grocer, automation installation and maintenance on chemical manufacturing, auto manufacturing, millwork facilities and even commercial buildings such as nursing homes are starting to implement automation to assist caretakers to run their jobs, While I was installing these devices, I was not aware I am actively contributing in taking away peoples jobs. For business owners, it makes so much sense, fewer human workers translate to fewer problems, higher efficiency and higher return on investment. they don't complain, they don't need to rest for a long time, they are obedient as long as you program it correctly. I do believe it is possible one day they may replace my job as well. imagine robots installing automation machinery lol. anyways, Mr. Yang got me to think and observe, it is not often when a politician encourages thinking and observation, most of them feed you shit and expect you to eat it. unfortunately, the shit they feed to the public are often packaged well by media groups that people willingly consume it. all in all, I personally like this guy. fan from canada : )

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!

#####
Andrew Yang. The true candidate of the internet age. He will grow even without media support.
#####
Andrew President Yang. 2020 #YangGang
#####
As recent as 4 months ago, Andrew Yang was being described as a fringe candidate. And now, just look at the huge crowds and financial support he is drawing. And the enthusiasm and positivity of his supporters are incredible. 
     Yang can, and will definitely,  win.
#####
He is a gift for America, use him!
#####
Lol "it's amazing he got this far"... Proceeds to raise 10mil. In the 3rd quarter. CNN clearly thought he was a fad. And it doesn't seem like it's changed much since
#####
It‚Äôs November 1, 2019 today and Wow!  Andrew Yang is making leaps and bounds in terms of his popularity all over the country because of his Humanity First, Make America Think Harder, Not Left, Not Right, But Forward thinking.
#####
Once a Bernie Sanders supporter, now on the Yang Gang. The 46th President of the United States of America, Andrew Yang!
#####
I've got a cool hashtag for you. #CommieCillizza

#YangGang
#####
MAGA = Make America Google Andrew Yang
#####
I voted for Trump. This time I'm voting for Andrew Yang.
#####
It's internet-fueled because you TV stations won't give him enough air time, not even during the debates!!!!
#####
Freedom Dividend starts at 18 and thru life.
#####
I'm starting to become a believer! And I'm not American.
#####

#####
America listen to yang 2020
#####
A Chinese guy who likes math has gained the respect of the Republican media.
#####
People have to register as a Democrat to vote in the Primary for Andrew Yang REGISTER REGISTER REGISTER then VOTE VOTE VOTE - Lets do this!
#####
Yang is what America needs to re-establish it‚Äôs place as a world leader. Stop seeing him as an Asian who happened to be born in America, seriously how barbaric. He is American first and foremost and should be treated that way.
#####
‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô•
#####
Yang is right - 100%
#####
Trickle up economy!!!
#####
THIS GUY MAKES GREAT POINTS, BUT CNN HAS BEEN VERY BIASED AGAINST YANG. SHAME ON YOU CNN!
#####
Hi Chris, I do respect that you've made an attempt to paint a picture explaining how Andrew Yang got from nowhere to here, but the truth is that your visible lack of belief that Andrew Yang is a genuine presidential candidate contender, still shines through. If you actually read, watch and listen to what real people are saying, not just online but at his rallies; you'll discover that it's not only UBI, Automation, the 'YangGang' and MATH buzzwords that's are getting people excited and passionate about his candidancy, it's his fearlessly honest, unconventional & intelligent ways of thinking. A polar opposite to the government currently in office today. Andrew's unselfish, unpolitical, original and progressive visions of the future are what's resonating with people, and not only citizens of the U.S,  but is capturing attention of the entire world. 


Take another moment to actually listen to his views on climate change, his experience in business, his understanding of economics, his concepts around immigration, let alone all of his other ethics-driven ideas on how we can improve diplomacy, accountability in the political system, eradicate violence etc... 


CNN may have the power to supress his coverage and manipulate viewers opinions about him through your own bias, but let it be said - you can not silence someone with ideas that make complete sense, and morals that match the wider population. CNN can either part of the journey and treat/cover him seriously, or CNN can continue to block, silence and supress Andrew Yang at the inevitable expense of their credibility and reputation. This man is worthy, let Yang Speak!

The point is constructive policies matter. The appeal is this is a man who seems to want to love and bank on humanity more than trash the opposition . The left or centre or right mainstream media has earned its moniker 'fake news' for rather obvious reasons. First it was to sideline Bernie in 2016 and now Yang. Will get quite a rise when his rise will wipe that smugnorant attitude of this particular presenters face.
#####
So, basically Andrew Yang, like Bernie Sanders, started as a grassroots movement and MSM makes this seem like a bad thing.üôÑ I say both Sanders and Yang should upened the DNC!
#####
Trump Vs Andrew Yang Policies
Make America Great Again = Freedom Dividend $1000 more realistic.
Drain The Swamp = Democracy Dollar more realistic.
2 same Ideas but one is just more Realistic to Apply.
#####
CNN does not want Trump defeated. Yang is the only one who can do it. They want you to vote for anyone else but him so they and their friends can keep getting tax breaks.
#####
I like this guy. Pretty straightforward. Can he do another segment on Yang now that we know Q3 numbers?
#####
Now he is everywhere...
#####
Fuck off CNN
#####
Yang dank AF BOIIIIIIII
#####
Yang gang!
#####
You guys are so lucky to have him. I really hope he becomes your president because your democracy is now a kleptocracy. Very sad. Ours is on the way to it too.
#####
I'm a Canadian and I care. 
I'm not on social media. I watched a las vagas talk where his interviewer didn't show. It was incredible. 
I knew I was hearing truth . Andrew is incredible. Facts facts facts, experience experience experience. Solutions solutions solutions.
I've learned so much in that talk so I googled everything and bought his book.
The war on normal people . Still learning from Andrew I wish he was running for the leader of my country. 
.

#####
Who said $1000 for up to age 64?
#####
Just to let you know yang gang are trimpets
#####
I hate Chris Cilizza
#####
I will take 1000 a month for a freedom yang gang... Getting 1000 as a citizen of the usa just to go use it buying meth and making some good cash is cool!  lots of money to be made from yang giving out free money.
#####
209,000,000 adults x $1000= $290,000,000,000 x 12= WTF
#####
Isn't welfare just free money for no reason anyway?
#####
All Ik is that nothing good comes from getting stuff free I‚Äôm a worker and my money in taxes is going to people who don‚Äôt , we need jobs so the people who want to work can become successful, but these handouts sound all wrong to me it attracts lazy lards who don‚Äôt wanna work , #workersforTrump #MAGA
#####
YangGang!!
#####
Yang wants to create a massive welfare state with free healthcare, education and $1000 a month.  Venezuela tried the socialist agenda in their country.  Venezuela is now one of the worst countries in the world to live in.  Poverty, crime and unemployment are characteristics of socialism  Hitler and Mao were socialist who murdered millions of people. He  offers no real plan to pay for the welfare other than a vat tax. The Vat tax would be passed to people at the checkout.  The worst politicians offer lots of welfare without the ability to pay for it.  Its not their money therefore they don't have to think about it.
#####
Yang!

I love this video because it says Kamala Harris is way ahead of Yang. Oh how the tables have turned.

‚ÄúOne name that might not ring a bell...‚Äù?  Maybe if he was able to speak for more than 3 minutes on your tv stations...?

Love the idea and I really need too I‚Äôm sick now no working I don‚Äôt have family so how I pay my bills that‚Äôs why I support yang his idea helps many Americans like me pls vote for yang üôèüá∫üá∏üëçüéÑ
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Ellen Brown, author of Web of Debt, says that Yang's UBI is a good policy for the Fed to implement for everyone, not just bankers, and can work with just the current level of Fed repo market non-inflationary Quantative Easing of $3.7t per year. No need for taxes.

Ok guys, time to step it up. We need more people that are politically disengaged to learn about Yang. We have the power to do this. I'm going to start carrying Yang cards and put them under windshield wipers at every parking lot I got to. I think if more of us do this it can have a huge impact on getting the word out.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
Andrew Yang is Amazing! He makes politics exciting again! Please support yang2020 from a Canadian
#####
Boy has his crowd size changed!
#####
Question:   What if Amazon illiminates workers to cover the UBI?
#####
Yang is no longer a long shot. He has become mainstream. Yang 2020.
#####
The US and the world need a POTUS who clearly understands and has sensible solutions to old problems as well as 21st century challenges that humanity faces. 
    Yang is the man.
#####
We been Andrew Yang in office. Yang or Bust!!!
#####
The interviewer's condescending facial expression @ 2:27 makes me want to punch her in the face!
#####
We could use the Syrian oil to pay for it all!
#####
Colorado Loves You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Andrew Yang!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
He is too scruffy to be a president.he is smart,that's truth, use $1000 to attract people? Really?automation instead of workforce is the technology innovation, not the robots fault, can you not to use technology propaganda to spread your intention? Before each candidate became the president, the promise they made never can be true, no one could save this country but american fellows. Create more jobs and stop feeding laziness and bring more trade with other countries and cut down  the taxes, let american make there own money not given free money.
#####
$1000 a month there will be strings attached later on
#####
Its a mistake to call Andrew Yang long shot...Yang is the only one speak clear, on point n more intelligent then most candidates. Andrew Yang is what we want to lead us in 2021!!!
#####
He is so ahead of the curve . I hope people back him.
#####
A long shot!! Not exactly a way to describe Andrew Yang.. It's like Dr Oz said he's our New President of the United States of America!! Like the sound of that already!!#YangGang2020üëç‚òëÔ∏èüá∫üá∏üòÅ
#####
No longer a long shot! Yang2020!!!
#####
I wish that the national press would allow the interview to be completed because only half of the question and proposals are presented- Andrew doesn't get to fully explain how UBI works with VAT to relieve not only poverty but drug addiction homelessness etc.
I will give credit that they got his name right!
#####
i don‚Äôt live in the US but i still want to vote for him ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #YANGGANG
#####
Yang just literally bought votes .. isn‚Äôt this illegal lmaoooo so dead right now
#####
Where UBI has been piloted it has led to people having more freedom or opportunities to find better jobs, as well as engage more in society and connecting with communities.  These issues are at the core of the problem US seems to be facing.  Let the robots do those other jobs....the people who did them hated them anyway and had no quality of life.  This (quality of life) is the key.  It has nothing really to do with "socialism" or some evil plot to reward laziness or any affront to capital-based entrepreneurialism.  One of the things few people are talking about is the unprecedented levels of depression and anxiety in the west and how this leads to fed-uppednesss and disengagement etc which weakens and destablizes society on so many levels (witness Trump and Brexit).  I find this guy refreshing.
#####
Keep him long shot while he is already climbing in polls. Even outperforming Kamala Harris.
#####
So excited to see Andrew Yang bring his ideas. #YangGang2020
#####
This guy is idiotic,  the robots are created and repaired by humans,  robots can not be doctors,  he has no plans for education,  birth control like hasidic people,  new and better jobs for people,  etc.. 
Completely senseless
#####
Humans in assembly-line settings are automatons and their output flows upwards and benefits the owners (this is what Marx criticized). A simple solution would be for the output and productivity of machines should be placed in a fund which directly goes towards employee pension contributions (like an ESOP). It almost makes too much sense...
#####
That‚Äôs such a bad idea
#####
Andrew Yang for president
#####
WE MUST GET YANG INTO OFFICE.
#####
Seems like a  no nonsense man. He is a modern style politician
#####

It is Time to have a President who cares for all the mothers ,youngs and all american families  .make more young American enterpreneurs  by Andrew Yang Math solutions .Humanity first Yang 2020.Make Americans  Prosperous again.Freedom Dividend will Unites people to move Forward have a whole some life to start and not empty handed in the 21st century AUTOMATED WORLD.Humanity has Andrew Yang's votes.All Americans, Valued and have been heard by HUMANITY FIRST YANG 2020.

Where would the $1000 come from thoe

Sounds to good to be true better than trump or that rat clinton.

Spread this MANS MESSAGE ON EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM YOU CAN !!! SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE FACTS

Dear NBC enough with the stupid ads for inspiring America. It's not real news.

This is called socialism people

Too stupid to insult

Heck yeah. Why am I just now finding out about this guy?
#####
US Is an UNDEVELOPED country today.
#####
Wait. Wait. Yang is giving this dude a grand a month presumably forever and the guy will "PROBABLY end up voting for him"???!
#####
So do millionaires and other well to do people also receive this $1000 monthly check? I guess I'm just wondering is there a cut off if you already make alot of money
#####
üëÅüëÅ Do it outta the necessity to prosper..  `‚ú®üá∫üá∏üëç lets do it'll be great
#####
Over 18? What makes anyone believe that it won't be used for recreational drugs. How do you monitor this cash flow?
#####
A VERY important thing he‚Äôs overlooking is this:

If Ford can make trucks in Michigan with robots, what‚Äôs to prevent them from making trucks in Mexico instead if they don‚Äôt have to pay a hefty tax?

You would have to put hefty tariffs on nearly everything to force companies to stay... and then foreign countries would retaliate with hefty tariffs of their own... and that would cripple or bankrupt all our industries that export to foreign countries... and then all our ‚Äúfree money‚Äù would disappear...and then we‚Äôd be just like every single other country that bankrupted itself trying to magically make socialism work.
#####
Every politician doubted trump.  Now everyone doubts yang.  Often the most ignored voices look for unorthodox figureheads to represent them because the establishment pays little to no attention
#####
$1000 A MONTH?! You can't be that stupid. Where does the money come from?
#####
Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
Andrew Yang = REVOLUTION
#####
Love the talk about "advanced automation" 3:24 Shows a bunch of 1980's to mid 1990's Arburg injection molding machines. Like those machines are advanced, lol. (The green and yellow ones, I believe the orange ones ore Husky's, which are prone to break down). Sounds like I'm nit picking, but just thought it was funny. Andrew Yang however, is the only competent candidate in my opinion running for president. Doesn't bark and moan, rather has real solutions to problems of today.
#####

I like Yang.  Doesn‚Äôt play racial politics.  He offers 21st century solutions

# YangGang2020
#####
A Somone you should do more Andrew yang videos it really get you a lot of views. nobody else watches any other of your videos. maybe next time try not to be so condescendingand & let your not let your bias show.  Not good at all.
#####
Imagine what this would do to fundraising.
#####
Really really scary stuff
#####
The UBI will help a lot of families to pay off rents and food expenses for their kids. So now, parents can actually have room to breath
#####
Let's get our FREEDOM DIVIDEND !!!
#####
If you truly deep down in your heart that the right thing for America is to just give every American over 18 $1,000... There‚Äôs something seriously wrong with your researching abilities. It takes 5 seconds to see how much money it costs JUST IN THE MONEY DELIVERED, it would cost another $1,000 PER PERSON just to have the tech and people to send all this money out, come on my fellow United States Citizens! You seriously can not believe this load of crap that is being fed to you! WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT! What‚Äôs the point of life if you are handed everything? Just end it. Not your life.. the STUPIDITY! End it!
#####
Trump 2020
#####
The downside people becoming lazier as technology kicks in. However I do like his peter pan concept.  It might work. Needs to be test it.
#####
2:11 Talks about how Andrew saved his life, but ends up saying he'd only "probably" vote for him... wtf
#####
THIS!!!
#####
My dude!!! #Yang2020
#####
A) Same old corrupt political crap ...
B) Same old corrupt political crap but with $1000/mo.
...Choices...
#####
Giving everyone  $1000 is the same as giving everyone $0. It's not worth anything if everybody receives it.
#####
Always tax the working class and give it to the non working class. How about you get to keep all you earn!
#####
Imagine giving someone 1k a month and they don't vote for you lol
#####
Lmao
#####
Yang increasing the feeling of entitlement that already cripples the Millennials. Making their dependence on the government more intense will only create less apt workers for the future. Why does every single Democrat want to steal from the tax payer to give free stuff to everyone else??? That whole concept is so broken on so many levels!
#####
2:01 That's the face of a man that really didn't want the world to know that he was crying because another man was giving him money.
#####
I'm joining the Yang Gang today!!!
#####
They must use that $1000 a month wisely. There needs to be restrictions.
#####
I will buy $980 worth of heroin every month.. it's still not enough!!
#####
That won't even replace a truck drivers' salary. 
Don't you think it'll disincentivize work?
...
_What?_
#####
Lol. Of course that guy's gonna vote for him. He gave him thousands of dollars.
#####
Yang gang!!!
#####
Andrew Yang will transform the economy for the people. Andrew Yang's 3 big plans fit together..FREEDOM DIVIDEND, MEDICARE FOR ALL, HUMAN-CENTERED CAPITALISM.  To be the greatest civilization, we need all 3 of Andrew's plans...1. Have money to spend 2. Health care for everybody 3. Measurements toward humans.  So all his policies promote humanity first and the economy exists to serve the people....His Freedom Dividend will force the economy to serve the people like he said...If these 3 things happened, United States will become the greatest civilization on Earth. A married couple with 3 adults children like this family gets $5000 a month. @t‚Äã
#####
He‚Äôs smart- choosing a poor white family to help gain the votes of those disenfranchised blue collar dems lost to trump and with the idea of getting $1000 a month ‚Äúno-strings‚Äù he will inevitably get the votes of people already imagining what they could spend it on, more stuff inflated by the 10% vat tax that will only partially pay for this monstrosity. Think people think, only people who love you give you things with no-strings, and even those who truly love you would only gift something that would help you to help yourself- the fishing pole comes with your ability to focus on the fishing lessons.
#####
Han Chinese Marxist-Leninist Yang.
It seems some people love such an advocate of Statism.
#####
Comments here are really positive but I'm trying to wrap my head around this. He's saying that in order to pay for all of this big business will be taxed around 2.5 to 3 trillion a year?
#####
Yang makes sense tbh you can see the American people there a very low percentage that are rich most of us are working check to check in reality I'm also Asian I hope he wins but this is America would Americans vote for an Asian ethnic background I was born here also but in people's eyes I'm still Asian decent I love America I would die for this country against any other country may it be China Russia or any other big threat in the end I'm still American even if I'm labeled as Asian
#####
CT you are nasty.  Despite this, Andrew Yang did great. Don‚Äôt forget to grill the other candidates the same way. So disrespectful.  Bye bye DB
#####
Anyone smart would be the opposite of trump.
#####
He is a real human been.   He is a Yang.
#####
I think Yang is the only person who can stand up to Trump's game in a 1v1.
#####
You can tell Chuck is part of the beltway conventional group thinkers
#####
He should run for congress and prove himself first and stop using scare tactics

His 3 companies that failed:
Stargiver - outright failure
Venture for America - outright failure failing to meet even 4% of objectives 
Manhattan prep - sold before recession to avoid impending failure

That's the summary of experience this joker who wants to be POTUS has ...

The google ideas candidate stuck in single digits who has zero experience and is a failed businessman

#####
I've never watched MSNBC before but Chuck is probably one of the worst interviews I've ever watched in my life
#####
Oh wow! He interviewed Yang as a person that just plain doesn't like him. I'm not expecting every interviewer to like everybody they speak to, but it's your job to get information out to the people. I really miss seeing interviews from people that don't show thier negative feelings before hearing what the other person has to say.
#####
Trump was the only one THAT ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT BOZO.
#####
His foreign policy is worth voting for.
#####
What a garbage interview. Why even bring Andrew Yang on if you're just gonna be a giant dickhead?
#####
I'm from HK and used to watch MSNBC but now no more after this and Chris Hayes's interview.
#####
100 bucks says Chuck Todd is still a virgin.
#####
This man who is giving the interview  is the worst smh, dude has no respect
#####
Aye this white need to stfu and let him speak.
#####
We need a universal basic income! It would help people get out off homelessness and give people oppertunity! I think Trump and Yang should run together and put pense in charge of nsa homeland security!
#####
This interview was the most disgusting and disturbing that I've ever watch. Chuck is very distasteful and low class! Andrew Yang really did a great job because me personally, I would have ripped him to shreds. What an a**hole! He sounded like a big hater. #ANDREWYANG2020
#####
@msnbc  those dislikes are for you. Not Yang.
#####
He threw all the hard questions and you can see the panic nothing was sticking
#####
I‚Äôll just put it this way this guy is too dumb to interview yang lol üòÇ . You can see the panic in his eyes üëÄ
#####
Chuck i hope you dont talk to your mother that way..aggression towards people who are trying to change our world for the better..should be giving credit were credit is due..please focus all your hate towards people ruining our country...way to go yang...
#####
Chuck Todd is an asshat, disprespectful, and obviously biased.  Screw MSNBC.

Chuck theres no respect for you after this interview!!!! By the way dont expect more subscribers when you clearLY disrespected Andrew yang!!!YANG*GANG2020

As a Republican, I will support this guy to be my next president. If he is not elected, Trump is my next choice.

Can‚Äôt stand how he talks to Mr. Yang. Same thing happened to Bernie in 2016.. horrible coverage.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

‚ÄúExplain how that works,‚Äù well, u impatient dummy, Yang would explain how it works if u would stop interrupting....

Andrew yang is what the democratic party needs.
#####
Freedom Dividend bandage is better than bleeding to death and become infected, poisoned, intoxicated by White bigotry and racism.
#####
I think he better become the VICE
#####
Vote no on Yang.  Paid for by Dogs and Cats.
#####
the fact that we have a democratic nominee who is actually generally liked by the republican party really says a lot. This man deserves to be president!
#####
chuck needs to be fired
#####
Ugh couldn't finish this video  What a rude reporter Yang had no chance to finish basically anything!!
#####
what a horrible interviewer.
#####
Mr. Yang is a well-fitted candidate for this position, his vision is prevailing with a genuine attack to every problem in America, MSNBC is being extremely disrespectful and its only making him stronger.
#####
Talk about disrespect! #yanggang

That's a very hostile and biased host.

<Interviewer: shifting topics, interrupting, ‚ÄúEXPLAIN HOW‚Äù, Why don‚Äôt you run for a lower position in the office?>
Terrible disrespectful, arrogant
Andrew Yang handled him like a consummate professional.

Looks like Andrew Yang is GOD SENT TO SAVE AMERICA!!!
#####
Jesus this interview is hard to watch. Yang is a good dude, treat him like an actual human.
#####
look, i am Indian.If america doesn't become president you are f***ed!
#####
Interviewer is horrible. What a smug P.O.S.
#####
MSNBC‚Äôs blatant low ball interviewing of Andrew makes me hate this network. It‚Äôs right up there with FOX news.. in fact FOX news treated Andrew with more respect than these dickheads. And... I‚Äôm a moderate liberal who voted Democrat since I was able to vote. But I have to say, I love watching Andrew calmly destroy these blatant bias fools. Trump will have nothing on Andrew. Andrew is a rock.
#####
Kept having to check that this was MSNBC, thought maybe Chuck had moved over to Fox, was definitely using their talking points!  Maybe he will use this as he audition tape?  On the other side AY handled this with his customary grace and intelligence. just as he has when he has gone over to right wing media.
#####
Yang 2020. Andrew Yang just in time to save America. If I'am America citizens I would donated $20 every week for Mr Yang campaign because this interview I think its racist.
#####
I was so confused whether to like or dislike this video for Yang's resilience or the host's inability to listen and extend basic courtesy respectively. Left a like because Yang Gang ignores haters.
#####
Chuck Todd, as I said, one of the shittiest journalists on TV. 


Kudos to Yang for keeping cool and on point while the rest of us think about what constitutes a punchable face.
#####
That dude us rude
#####
Yang2020‚úÖ
#####
I like this interview it was a good sceptical to the point  of learning and understanding what it will intelligently intell his point but not so much it look like an attack  very good well rounded Interview üòÅ
#####
Chuck - MATH, Make America Think Harder - although I am glad you did it this way because your skepticism was so clearly countered. Listen to what is being said and think about it, don't just react. For me it is so refreshing to hear a man like Yang put value on those whose endeavors are not known for making money like raising kids or being creative or an artist etc. Trickle up, how many times has that ever been tried around here? What political hopeful has ever said ANYTHING about those people who make the world better and more interesting and do it for what amounts to NOTHING? Thanks for thinking about those people Mr. Yang, and for trying to do something that benefits the little guy instead of what all of us are used to, and for trusting and knowing that the dividend will be put to very good use.
#####
typical msnbc interupting and ignoring yang and tulsi. I hate this station and that sociopath rachel madcow.
#####
Wifey and I aren't going to the movies tonight, instead going on a run. Andrew is getting $60 of that savings. Wifey wanted to put in $100 this week but I was like CALM DOWN WOMAN!  I bet if I check my Chase account she put in the $40...hehehe Yang2020 Baby!
#####
Andrew was not going to miss the opportunity to say Upchuck...hehehe
#####
I don't think he is peeling off any voters but ones democrats could of got with promised money. I am Trump supporter and still voting for Trump. I will say though if he wins then I would not be mad and support him. Take that for what it is.
#####
This felt VERY disrespectful and biased from the start. 
I feel people are turning away from mainstream TV news because it so often like this. Listen to Andrew on Joe Rogan to heat what he says when actually given a chance.
#####
Yes, Andrew Yang! ‚ù§üòé
#####
The interviewer is asking questions that everyone knows the answer too except for the interviwewer

Chuck Todd should just wear a t-shirt that states his bias.

Dear MSNBC,
Fire Chuck Todd.
Thanks.

It's always incredible to me how almost unquestionably a trickle-down kind of economy, quite often proposed by conservative speakers, is rather unchallenged and taken as a given. The idea that you cut taxes, particularly on the higher incomes and that alone will re-juvenile the economy and creating millions of jobs. We've been hearing this for now almost 40 years. And pretty much any state that tried it, had to roll back. If we can do this, in practise and not talk about it then whey is the idea of a trickle-up economy where you take pressure away from the lowest classes seen as such a bad idea? I say let us try it. The time is right.

I am a full-fledged Trump supporter. I have voted Republican my entire life.  But I really like Andrew Yang.  He is intelligent, he is very thorough, he has a plan and is very clear on how his plan is going to be paid for.  This man is a genius.  And Mr. Yang if you're reading this, I have never ever voted for a Democratic president ever!  

Yet I will say, if the Democrats make you the primary candidate I may switch my vote as long as you have like-minded people that will serve under you.

The majority of Democrats have made such a fool of themselves focusing on impeaching the president instead of getting our country in order.  Life-long Democrats are walking away due to the shenanigans in the White House. It's a total embarrassment to our Country, but you sir are not an embarrassment.  I highly respect you and I would be thrilled if you were our President.

To the gentleman's story/question at around 9:45 --
It sounds as though he answered his own question. Because it seems many times with these mass shootings (apparently we've had more than the number of days in the year 2019) the shooter has no demands, no questions, no message to broadcast, not even his own cry for help.
I would argue that the crime itself is a form of protest, a twisted radical way to shine light on the sickness of which mass random violence is a symptom (although that metaphor just got a bit circular I admit).
But a culture that normalizes gub violence and innocent bystander casualties, children, starts to feel like a society that has endorsed bystander apathy and inaction instead of the outrage and fast-acting problem solving such events merit. Perhaps the mass murderers, our brother co-patriots and fellow American citizens,  are effectively and literally shooting into the crowd of bystanders turning a blind eye to injustice and preventable harm.
Bet once we stop playing "pass the buck" or at least pass the buck to Andrew Yang, we see much of our stress anxiety and violence drop as that energy is redirected to constructive endeavors.
The root of the sickness btw is not the right to bear arms, imo.
The root is an affliction that disproportionately affects women and children and moms and POC, it is intergenerational and envitonnental, it is contagious and results from a combination of nature and nature. Most of all it is an ailment that is rarely overcome by sheer willpower or faith alone. Those factors, along with prayer, are powerful tools. What's more is we already have all the resources we need in order to cure the often fatal sickness infecting our nation and world: poverty. 98% of social ills result from this, rather than moral failures ot malicious intent. Most people want to be happy. Many are being pushed to the edge of frustration and desperation on a regular basis, in isolation, with falsified media images rottimg yheir perceptions of success and the reality of other folks.

The day we are able to reduce money as a valued currency and elevate pro-social values as quantifiable measurements of capital, is the day break the iron grip of greed and scarcity thinking.
That's just me though; could be wrong.
YANG THO. GENIUS! 
* happy dance

Short on specifics while answers that don't really correspond with the Questions asked while the only positive thing about UBI is more freedom on how social welfare will be more flexible. He is basically giving people answers that sounds good to hear but nothing substantial in terms of having Real effects or non impact at all coming from his so called fake policies.
#####
Please read this Michael Bloomberg:  "you should drop out of the race and endorse Andrew. You are polling too low for all the millions you are spending on your campaign.  Andrew is on one of your channels, guessing you like Andrew somewhat to have given him so much time to speak on this program."

Democrats‚Äô debates have been conducted in an atmosphere of utopian fantasy and have done permanent damage to several candidates. Beating Trump is main issue for Dems, but debates have been conducted without reference to impact of policies on battleground states or electoral college.
#####
Mr. Yang needs to propagate the innovative idea of a 1%Tax on Wall Street turnover. The tax money netted by this (Tobin Tax) should be divided for the use of Federal and State governments. In effect the money would be stimulus to start a financial recovery of the U.S. He could also propagate the idea of nationalising the Federal Reserve, so instead of financing hedge fund operators, toxic derivatives speculators and bail-outs, the Reserve could be put to work for the American people and fund public lending for infrastructure including education science drivers, ports and hospitals to name a few. The Fed becomes the new Bank of America.¬†
He is on the right track with wanting to initiate the development of Thorium molten salt reactors to phase out oil and coal and he clearly understands that the current form of nuclear power production using Uranium/Plutonium, is antiquated. The proper economic model for the prosperity of the U.S. is the American System of Political Economy. Yang needs to illustrate an intension for America to abandon Austrian School Economics for the tried and true American System as developed by Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay and implemented by Washington, Lincoln, FDR, JFK among others.

This guy's a genius, he's literally predicting the future. It would be really disappointing if he doesn't win, other countries that looked up to our Democracy are going to glance at us disdainfully. Such an accurate prognostication of the near future, yet so many people who are not listening but hearing, which means they dont understand what is going on, and also watching from the sidelines looking at us like an un-laughable joke.
#####
Many people underestimate the power of democratic dollars.  They don't know a $100 democratic dollar could cause what kind of impact. Here is a simple MATH.

In the US Presidential election, both parties will get 60M votes at lease.  Suppose 10% of your voters donate their democratic dollar to you, it is 600M dollars for each party.  So how big is Super PAC?  Take Hilary, the primary beneficiary of Super PAC in 2016.  She got 132M from pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action.

600M vs 132M.  Do you see the difference? Which one will you choose?

Yang's democratic dollars CONVERGE candidate's personal interest with normal people's interest.  A politician can get Very Rich by serving his/her voters legally.  He doesn't require any Dark money.  This will also attract more talented, smart young people to campaign public service. Can you imagine how it will change America politics?

This is a giant nerd who would be actually the best guy for the job but no one will vote for him in the primary I think

Being that I live in an extremely rural area, I am the sole income for my family of 3 who only makes 1500 a month without government assistance besides Medicaid for our daughter and it fully covers all needs and costs with extra in savings every month. 1000 would allow us to live more freely, give more locally, engage in our community more, bond more as a family through outings we can‚Äôt really do right now. It would allow us to get out of any debts and pay off our home and car.
#####
OOOOooooh......   He sounded smart until he talked about Universal Basic Income.  
Andew, not every person has the instict to get up everyday and chase down their dreams.  In fact, many people don't.  Giving them free money will encourage them to live their dream of sitting at home.  
The whole reason WORK, works well.  Is that you go out and work most of the day.  Putting money in your pocket and keeping you out of trouble.  
Automation or not, there is something of value for you to go out and do.  How much you get paid to do it is up to you and how you were raised.

Andrew Yang is making sense. Last night‚Äôs debate demonstrated to this voter why Yang deserves our full attention. Two main¬† Andrew Yang policy positions resonate with me, Universal Income and how the¬†Robot Apocalypse can bring our divided nation together.¬† The dark side of automation is a looming issue creating deep chasms in our already divided nation.¬† Consider how well our current Executive in chief exploited this group‚Äôs legitimate feelings of economic loss. We are in the midst of a major transition to¬†artificial intelligence¬†(see automation).¬† The President has blamed immigrants when the clear nemesis is¬†Artificial intelligence-the advance of technology. Imagine how farmers felt during the genesis of the industrial age.

Consider truck drivers. There are 3.5 million truck drivers on the road today (robot trucks will be here within 3-5 years and quickly replacing drivers). The savings are considerable ( replacing human drivers with self-driving trucks that can run all of the time) will save an estimated $168 Billion a year.¬†¬†Artificial intelligence¬†is replacing thousands of call center jobs right now. About 8% of American jobs are in the STEM field, 92% are not. The 5 most common jobs in the U.S. right now are 1) Administrative and clerical 2)¬† Retail and Sales 3) food service 4) Truck Driving 5) Manufacturing. Right now all aforementioned jobs are in the midst of a change to Artificial intelligence (automation).¬† 32% of Americans graduated from college, 68% with a high school diploma or below. 68% of Americans are working in the at-risk to automation industries.¬† ¬† We need an interim solution for the margins to keep the most at risk from going off the rails-into much more expensive societal concerns (incarceration, homelessness, drug addiction, emergency room healthcare).¬† Remember an extra $1000.00 for the average working American, living paycheck to paycheck, would largely end up right back into the economy in the form of retail, deferred car repair payments, dining out, out of pocket healthcare costs.¬† This purchase activity would result in revenue back to the states/Fed.¬† We would see the revenue back and save on societal shared marginal costs. ¬†Easy to take the jaded view and consider these payments a form of welfare. ¬†Remember that we practice corporate welfare every year by allowing companies to pay the equivalent of ZERO income taxes. ¬†Why not ask these companies benefiting from automation to provide a dividend back to all of us and especially those displaced by automation?

‚ÄúThe monthly stipend, which Yang dubs the ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù is intended to ameliorate economic insecurity, wealth inequality,¬† and the other symptoms of social malaise stemming from capitalism‚Äù.

¬†¬†

Automation is more efficient than¬† ‚Äì human labor. Automation is more efficient by any metric.¬† ¬† Robots, not immigrants are causing economic dislocations. Just consider how loyal any company is to your interests when it comes to their bottom line.¬† Do we protest the inevitable accelerating transition towards greater efficiency or address this problem with a practical solution- see Universal income?¬† Practical solutions or protesting the inevitable?¬† Time to manage the transition. Time to take a look at Andrew Yang.

Trump supporters, disillusioned with the current real economy, tariffs, and twitter communication, should pay attention to Andrew Yang.¬† Consider the details below of Andrew Yang‚Äôs Freedom Dividend.

Those on the fence about Andrew Yang 2020 possibly due to the myth that Joe Biden is the only Democrat who can beat the current White House occupant,¬† take a look at this MATH.

‚ÄúYang is polling right now in 4th position with 8% National Polling; ahead of Harris, Booker, Castro (established politicians).¬† ¬†Yang is the only Democratic candidate with a high percentage of Trump supporters in his camp,¬†¬†‚ÄúYep. I‚Äôm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say that they would support,‚Äù Yang said.

Why is that? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I‚Äôm focused on solving the problems that they see around them every day. And I‚Äôm laser-focused on trying to make their lives better. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting thousands of Trump voters as well as Independents and Libertarians and Democrats and progressives. If I‚Äôm the Democratic nominee, we win. That‚Äôs the math.‚Äù
#####
Yeah lady... white nationalist terrorism is the problem ü§£

Go check the Pew statistics on murdering the US
#####
This still makes me feel sick to watch this level of media corruption.
Just sad. I hope Biden and his son get sorted and the Dem's release control of the media. Treason is boring now, we want a good society.
#####
CNN has caused and will cause many Democrats to view CNN as fake news!
#####
How can you not like this guy. Even the white nationalists like this guy, and he's asian. That says something doesn't it?
#####
Yang is an honorary white supremacist.
#####
Andrew Yang is Nazbol gang!
#####
I didn't know North East Asians were whites hahahaha
#####
Such a disgrace from CNN. But not surprised
#####
Skip to 2:58 so you hear the full response from Yang. His answer is spot in with intelligence.
#####
Yang: "vote for me bc I am Asian and Im good at math" implying Asians are better at math.... now imagine if a white candidate said that white people are better at ANYTHING...
#####
People are mad about CNN! Not yang. He really wants to help everyone. Plus he said he would put white nationalist on domestic terrorism list. Also in my community I live in a black community even though I'm mixed with latino Asian and Irish that his plan would pump 23 million dollars into my town every month just by instead of giving tax breaks to wealthy people he wants to make our economy trickle up. Our society is falling behind because our corporations and government is succeeding while we all every American especially in low and middle class are being driven poorer okay. We keep failing our citizens in favor or corporations and government. This is a once and a life time opportunity. This could rebuild African American communities while also rebuilding midwest communities failing cities suburbs. He also is supporting the MOST POPULAR healthcare plan. Which is having government insurance for everyone who can't afford it and want it while also letting people keep insurance they want. This is important we only get one chance for real tangible change. Don't listen to the haters they are just mad because he is surging in popularity. Please America don't miss out on this opportunity.
#####
Let all races go back to where everyone came from. This country was never be so called USA. It was used to be Indian's land. Long history before time. Indian who first comes first serves. No one can claim this country  ---  if everyone who keeps being so racist against any races. QUIT DIVIDING THE WORLD. START UNITED THE WORLD NOW. Everyone should share the power, business & money. STOP MAKING ENEMIES. START MAKING FRIENDS. STOP CAUSING WAR. START MAKING PEACE. GEEZ.....FOOLISH PEOPLE ----- HAVE SOME BIG BRAINS AND HEART, WILL Y'ALL??!! LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO HATE NATIONALITY RACES OF COLORS. STOP BEING SO CLOSED MINDED IN THE EYE OF GOD!!!!

JEALOUS / ENVY DESTROY FRIENDSHIPS. QUIT MANIPULATION. QUIT BEING TRAITOR. PEACE!!
#####
Some white peoples are too stupid always asked the dumbest questions to an Asian...... But Asian people are more smarter, hardworking, humbleness, selfless than the white people who are very favoritism, criticism, judgmental & extremely racist against anyone other than their own kind so called WHITE SKIN COLOR. God created all humans. God gave justice for all humans. But humans makes it harder for human kinds. God will judge those who have done such injustice to other humans. White peoples are so delusional blinded to the truth so they don't understand who they are coming from.

White peoples should look themselves deep in the mirror thoroughly through & see what kind of character did they show to the world of who they really are. Are they that so called beyond perfect?? All have flaws --- rotten attitudes. America need to think harder instead of being so racist (narrow minded) against skin colors & nationality.

For me, I don't look at their skin colors but only look deep down to the core  ----  the heart of character that they would show me --- purely good or sickly evil. REMINDER: all comes from dust & all will return to dust in the end. AMERICA   --------------    OPEN UP YOUR EYES WIDER AND SEE THE BIG PICTURE IN FRONT OF YOU. ARE WE ALL HUMANS FROM THE SAME ROOTS  OF ADAM & EVE.?? Do the research fully before making judgments of other humans. Tells like it is.
#####
Glad that Andrew Yang doesn't wear tie. Show that he's a humble man with dignity & integrity. He look so cool without tie unlike those old folks who wore old fashion tie on. They are so old school. So backwards. Andrew is someone who has the brain & heart of moving forward. He walk the walk. People who are all talks but no actions....meaning that they're lying...two faced & hypocrite.
#####
Ok but honestly asian people are just as racist against people of color as white people. Got videos for days proving it so dont just don't
#####
Racist people are so low on the iq scale.
#####
Wow they're really trying this? Pulled a quote with no context after asking about white nationalist support. I never knew he had any of their support until she said it.
#####
Typical cnn
#####
Yang himself acknowledged that he had an influx of white nationalist support based on some misunderstandings regarding his writings...so CNN knows wtf they're talking about.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5cb3c987e4b098b9a2d57b66/amp
#####
cnn and Jeffrey Adam Zucker kvetching :p
#####
He's only concerned about poor whites because he knows that a lot of them would do something stupid and violent in a desperate attempt to regain power in society. Glad he clarified for everyone.
#####
If Bernie doesn't get it, it's Yang2020. Okay, guys. If not him then Warren.
#####
I was concerned until I saw the like to dislike ratio
#####
Yang is a good, honest man, so he will definitely lose. The average working class American is stupid, racist and religious (AKA Trump voters). It's just a fact. Their vote is based on whoever they'd prefer to have a beer with.
#####
He mentioned Dhar Khan.
#####
So it's ok to be a nationalist but nor if you're white
#####
CNN became a visual tabloid at best
#####
The capitalist elite is financing Bernie Sanders but he will to, if elected, end up like Trump. Sanders is a tool in the hands of the elites, exactly as Trump is now and maybe has ever been since his inception.
The elite is fooling us all, whites and non-whites. But while non-whites fall for it in their majority, whites don't.
I just hope that they'll stop being manipulated by the elites and vote for a candidate that is not a disguised instrument of the elite, or even stop voting altogether and start demonstrating instead.
Maybe creating a new movement: I propose the name White Lives Matters.
#####
If white nationalists are supporting Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard, maybe that says something about their electability compared to someone like Harris or Buttigieg.
#####
If you are an underdog such as disabled or the working poor or someone that's on welfare you WOULD NOT VOTE for yang. He wants to take away your food stamps,  housing vouchers,  safety nets,  disability and then you get $1000. However if you are rich you dont have to make any sacrifices.  So the "no strings attached " only applies to the wealthy.
#####
the fucking real RACIST is BLACK PEOPLE?  THEY ALWAYS BRING UP THEIR RACE IN EVERYTHING?  THEIR ARE GROUPS SUCH AS THE BLACK- COCUSE IN CONGRESS? BLACK THIS BLACK THAT? THEY CAUSE THE MOST CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY AND YET THIS WHOLE FUCKING COUNTRY HAS TO BOW DOWN AND KISS THEIR ASS'S? FUCK THAT  BULLSHIT?
#####
They did the same thing with trump and the KKK, CNN can say whatever they want and when they don‚Äôt get what they want they cry like a baby
#####
I support Yang 100%. Checkout his policies https://yang2020.com

My dislike was for CNN and the clickbait title, not Yang

5:16 Imaging if Trump said shit like that. He didn't even have the balls to blame the white supremacists at Charlottesville. You know why people attacked those racist fucks? Because it's a rally of people, supporting white supremacy!!! You don't thing people have had enough of this shit? White supremacists have been doing this shit for years. Cops have been killing black people for years and they're still doing it and you got a white supremacists rally in Charlottesville and what the fuck do you know, people just weren't having it so they decide to show those racist cock suckers what the fuck happens when you hold a fucking WHITE SUPREMACISTS RALLY!! Racism has been going on for way too fucking long. Trump didn't even have the balls to condemn the actions of those racist fucking idiots who "know" they can hold a fucking white supremacist rally and get away with it.
#####
Yet another demonstration of MSM stupidity. I can‚Äôt wait for this network to go under. It‚Äôs average viewer is 65 and on average ppl by wide margins disapprove of cnn YouTube videos what does that say
#####
Andrew has grown on CNN since then lol
#####
On a lighter note Andrew's hair has never looked better.
#####
Yang talks BS when it comes to Thorium..   üòÇ
He has no clue and just guessing.
So he has no business discussing it when he is wrong.  Misleading with BS. I ain't voting for people who talk BS.
#####
Any White man who would vote Democrat is suicidal. Do it. But don't take US with you.
#####
How dumb are white nationalists to not realize this man is Asian?
#####
CNN is trash for a question like that. Just give everyone the same fair chance. Don't slander the man on national tv.
#####
"Why are you worried about poor wH√èTƒïs?" I mean....why shouldnt he? Shouldnt we care about any poor person to begin with? Why is this even a question?
#####
CNN is corrupt. Fake media. Such a disgrace. Unprofessional journalism. Donald Trump was right all this time.
#####
Asian guy are most ignored and discriminated in USA.
#####
If CNN talks shit about a DNC candidate I assume that the candidate is on the correct side of the issue. Corporate, bought and paid for hacks.
#####
I can't take him seriously. His demeanor makes me think he's hiding something. He needs to wear a tie too.
#####
*gets edgy*
*wonders if the sane Republicans are onto something and contemplates switching parties*
#####
For those of you who hate CNN with all your hearts join me in never clicking on a CNN you tube video again. Whether you hit dislike or not it doesn‚Äôt matter to them. It‚Äôs the views that matter so if you want to end their lies and hate mongering don‚Äôt click on CNN trash.
#####
Man, i like him. Its not all boasting like most candidates, he is focused on the issues and solving them. Outstanding!
#####
This shouldn't even be a topic to be discussed its a clear cut motive for anyone to support who they want and Yang is perhaps the only candidate besides Tulsi Gabbard and Bernie Sanders that can unite both democrats and republicans in our country. That's why we all like him and his true vision for America. #yanggang #yang2020
#####
Instead of celebrating the fact that Andrew Yang has done the near impossible and gotten even white nationalists to support him, CNN instead makes it seem like Andrew is somehow shady... The dude has solutions. He sees the pain in ALL parts of the country and does not discriminate skin color. You can be black, white or whatever. He has a solution for you. Also...white nationalists supporting an Asian man for president is a complete contradiction. These are just people who feel like they've been left behind.
#####
Lmfao cnn really try to say that white nationalists are for a Asian man wow cnn are super fake news
#####
Fuck you CiaNN
#####
Andrew yang is one of the United States enemy's.üáπüáºüá®üá≥üá∞üáµ
#####
It‚Äôs funny the people think this is a stupid question... but take a look at Aum Shinrikyo the Japanese terrorist cult. Shoko Asahara the founder based a lot of his group‚Äôs infrastructure on the Nazis, and his weapon of choice was nerve gas specifically the ones the nazis created. So it really isn‚Äôt such an absurd question. The mythos of the nazis is so large that it has superseded reality and has become the unreal, it has even superceded the racial question at times. So unreal that a Japanese kid can become kindred spirits with der fuher.
#####
2000s: Everyone laughing at how shitty and sensationalist Fox News is.

2019: Everyone laughing at CNN because of how shitty and sensationalist it is.
#####
For the first time ever... a candidate answers questions directly with facts, logic and concrete plans that sound simple yet intelligent. No political pandering, just real genuine words. Go Yang! Charasmatic smart Asian dad for the win! Btw CNN is a joke.
#####
This is a new low for CNN.  And they wonder why people stopped watching mainstream media.  This is why.
#####
What's with the stupid fucking questions
#####
How an you say "white nationalists support asian man running for president" and see nothing wrong with that statement and make it seem like it's nothing.
#####
Andrew Yang disavows any and all support from White nationalists and that's good! Trump has disavowed numerous upon numerous upon numerous times over and over and over and over and over again but people still call him a racist! Pathetic! Trump 2020 Baby!
#####
I like Andrew Yang! He's a cool cat! But I think Trump will still win!

Real news: ‚ÄúAndrew Yang‚Äôs stance on automation and protecting American jobs‚Äù

CNN: ‚ÄúArE yOu A WHitE nAtionAlist?????‚Äù
#####
If the right doesn't have a problem with what he says, and the left doesn't have a problem with what he says, is this not a viable way forward for our country? Something to unify us and give us the president we need?
#####
All immigrants trying to cross the southern border illegally should be shot on sight
#####
Let me break it down. Boomers emotional. Millennials rational. It's comes down to growing up with the internet.
#####
Why is being a white nationalist bad? Doesn't nationalist mean love for your nation? What does skin color have to do with anything?
#####
As an independent, I find the woman interviews him is so impolite.  Though I don't find all the questions are offensive, but she doesn't fit to be a reporter.  He concerns about all the people okie lady.  Hate has no place in this country regardless of any race.
#####
This just proves that the leftist establishment media has already chosen their candidate (Biden) and are now rolling out the usual identity politics bullshit onto threats like Yang who has united more liberals and conservatives on common issues than I've seen of any other of the Democratic candidates. Don't let the establishment have you turn on the only guy with a brain. Never in my life did I think I'd defend a Dem on YouTube. CNN üëé
#####
Someday (soon, I hope) people will look back on cnn as we now do on the inquisition or the black death... terrible times in our History that are now gone forever.
#####
White nationalist violence as terrorism? How about calling murder as terrorism lol.

1:30 ‚Äúthese people broke the law‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù
#####
DONATE TO KEEP ANDREW YANG MOVE FORWARD. WWW.YANG2020.COM
#####
whoa, where is the rest of the interview?
#####
The accusation makes sense when you realize that CNN calls anyone who supports a non democrat political insider a white nationalist.
#####
Asian man: *acknowledges that white people have problems.*


CNN: "WHITE SUPREMACIST!!!"
#####
nice one CNN, so Trump was right after all huh.... you eat your own
#####
Andrew Yang serves better as Secretary of Treasury in my opinion. He just seems to be more passionate and familiar about the economy and it's issues. No offence to any supporters of Yang dubbed "The Yang Gang"
#####
Gosh.
#####
The dislikes are for cnn asking dumb questions and the likes are for yangs
#####
Considering that the media treat Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro like "alt-right" white nationalists, I don't really believe them when they suggest that Yang is being supported by a  bunch of racist white people.
#####
If Yang wins the primaries then this will be the first election I will love if he democrat or republican wins, this is pretty fucking historic
#####
By white surpremist they mean republicans just FYI
#####
Mainstream media like cnn never ceases to surprise me with how bs they can be. #yang2020 #yanggang #humanityfirst
#####
CNN= corrupt nonsense news
#####
Stand strong Yang, we dislike because of CNN
#####
The dislikes on this clip is so satisfying!  CNN got schooled by yanggang #Yang2020 #humanityfirst
#####
At this point CNN should be universally condemned for implying that somehow every "poor white" is a white nationalist. As a Chinese immigrant, my high school teacher who introduced me to African American culture was a "poor white." Abraham Lincoln was a "poor white." This kind of implicit brainwashing and explicit racism is abominable in nature.
#####
CNN look at those dislikes, you're trash.
#####
What a joke
#####
Fucking pathetic. CNN is a propaganda machine for the powerful. This is clear bias against a minority candidate for not falling in line.
#####

#####
IF Yang is not on the ballet in 2020, I'm voting for Trump @CNN

CNN seems to be threatened by Yang. This interview said way more about CNN than it did about Yang. It‚Äôs not uncommon for sore losers to throw low blows when they‚Äôre scared. #YangGang!

WE ARE NOT BEING TOLD THE TRUTH #YANG2020

You can tell this was meant for people who only watch NBC. Make it seem like he's only just getting popular now, he's got strange followers from the internet, that's why we never talked about him

Enjoy seeing how he climb from bottom and gradually climb to the top.

Even if he didn't wins due to election structure, he definately achieve the most phenomenon candidate in US history!

I think Yang is the best candidate. Yang 2020!!! Automation will effect a lot more than poor whites.

Wow great coverage

Andrew Yang is a problem solver who has really found a way to solve America's problem, they just need to accept it.

This is the worst thing that could happen to America. 

This is just more government control in our lives.  Can't you see where this is going?  If this man had his way, income tax would be 100%.  That's right, 100% of your check would go to the government. 

Now once the government has your money, they will "redistribute" the money to everyone, based on need.

This is classic Marxism.  Everyone puts in what they can, and gets back what they need, and the government will decide what you need.  If you are a doctor or lawyer, you will be able to put in alot more than others, but you will get out no more than anyone else.   If you don't make much money, you will put in very little, but get out the same as anyone else. 

So, gone then would be any incentive to work, any incentive to better yourself, because even though you are able to generate more income, you will not benefit from it.

Sooner or later, no one has any incentive to work, and when no more money is coming into the government, the government runs out of other people's money, and your entire economic system collapses. 

Marxism is from Karl Marx.  This is where Hitler got alot of his ideas...

You need 15% to get even one delegate. If Yang polled at 10% in every primary election, he would have no delegates at the convention.  At what point would he need to throw in the towel and become a surrogate for Bernie?  Just asking‚Ä¶ He could be Bernie's VP.

I am a different thinker and only Andrew Yang has a plan to offset the rise of AI and automation taking away jobs and providing income to the Americans.  He really does make a compelling point that we are not going to reestablish most of these manufacturing jobs in the US.  Mark Zuckerberg proposed a universal income and I am in agreement.  It would change the rates of poverty.  People would not have to be as reliant on credit cards.  Childcare would be more manageable.

I believe he will not properly address the threat posed by China. Not because of his ethnicity but because he does not understand national security. While I agree that we need to help people here at home, he openly states that China's economic growth is not a threat. I disagree because China has ideological values that are in direct conflict with ours. They seek to change the current international system that is based in western values.

like Trump, Yang exploiting financial struggles of masses. Hugo Chavez in Venezuela exploit masses in same way. He campaign oil companies not paying fair share taxes. Because oil industry boom, Venezuela richest country in Latin America. Chavez promise free food, healthcare, education, jobs. Masses loved him. But when Oil industry collapse, no more money for welfare programs and jobs. Massive unemployment. It is a mistake to think profitability is forever. Yang = Chavez Amazon = Oil industry UBI = Welfare Program

great interviews. props to NBC news and interviewers. #yanggang

Even if he passed the thous a month  for like 60+ AGE GROUP STARTING OUT I think he would get a  lot of votes for the idea.

All the "alt right" talk in this video is just a scare tactic to get dems to not vote Yang...dont be fooled, he's the best choice!

Yang makes perfect sense. Yang 2020!

Andrew Yang 2020 !
#####
History in the making. Yang all the way
#####
The reason he's popular with the Alt-Right is because he has solutions for problems that hurt everyone, left, right, racist, not racist... It helps everyone.
#####
There‚Äôs no White supremacy, just White people feeling the scarcity of jobs, economy and they see other non-whites, immigrants making more money than them.
#####
Freedom dividend is highly overrated. Since Yang is treating SSI payments as welfare, is senior elects to take $1,000 freedom dividend, his social security payments will be reduced by $1,000. So Yang plan is no starter for most of the 62 Million seniors who are collecting social security in 2019. .

MATH MAKE AMERICA THINK HARDER

How do rebut if Trump steals Andrew Yang's idea and propose 1200 freedom dividend?

"Everybody is for UBI but they do not know it yet" - Enno Schmidt
Andrew Yang has it right UBI but he is not the only ones to back this concept. It may surprise you to learn that the Federal Reserve and UBI was discussed at the at the bilderberg group by Guy Standing. If was discussed there the infamous secret meeting of the world elite, then you can count on it coming to fruition. Guy Standing make the best case for UBI, He is an economist and first advocated a universal basic income (UBI) ‚Äì a regular unconditional sum paid to all adults regardless of employment status ‚Äì he was considered quixotic (where quixotic is a synonym for ‚Äúa crackpot‚Äù). When his book The Precariat ‚Äì which identified an emerging class of people whose lives were diminished by short-term and zero hours contracts ‚Äì was published in 2011.
Guy Standing ted talk about UBI is needed:

If only Yang had kept on like this, instead of going all politician doublespeak on Medicare For All- another issue Martin Luthur King Jr. believed in- his campaign might not have imploded.  Also, that was a terrible move when literally every other politician was abandoning Medicare For All- he could have picked up a lot of left-wing voters jumping ship from the Warren campaign and such if he had stuck with it...

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
Yang needs to team up with celebrities to get more views
#####
Biden  and buttiege* are copiers of yang
#####
Everything this man says is facts it would be a shame if he doesn‚Äôt win
#####
Only this man sees the genuine problems. His logics make complete sense.
#####
Yang and his wife are intelligent and real.. very likeable..
#####
People who say "whats a $1000 a month going to do?" are so out of touch with the everyday person. Thats my mortgage.

Vote no on Yang.  Paid for by Dogs  and Cats.

#####
This is the smartest man running in the election. If he ran in Canada I would vote for him without a second thought. He is calm, rational, and prepared, I like that.
#####
Andrew Yang is No Joke, in my country we scan our own items in supermarkets and pay by debit card! there goes cashiers job! :(
#####
Bill Maher is finally hearing facts for the first time.
#####
people rely on jobs for their income and their income is their right to live.
#####
I'm not even American but I can feel there is something with this guy. Look at any political Youtube video comments, it's insults and trolling from all sides. But about Yang, Democrats and Republicans seem to be able to have a dialog again. Just for this reason you should vote him in.
#####
The D tells me that they don‚Äôt respect gun rights.
#####
so agreeing.
#####
Andrew Yang has the number one quality I am looking for in our next president that is never talked about...creativity. He thinks outside the box, is empathetic, humble, and honest. He is a 21st century candidate. The rest of them are not.
#####
Something will have be done when automation takes over. I don't think giving people free money just for existing is the answer.....at all.
#####

Second you got my attention

And after listening to you on the Iowa PBS episode, you've got my vote sir.

When a candidate legitimately gets bill mahers respect you know theres something to it. The man clowns every politician lol
#####
Once upon a time horses were everywhere, where are they now
#####
Very smart and civil man. One of the most professional and linear politicians I have ever seen.... however his UBI does not answer how do we prevent hyperinflation while backing the currency of the petrodollar? Another thing he never explains is how would we create advance medicine and technology if we had a much more stricter market and private sector?
#####
Immigration has kept wages stagnant.
#####
Everyone, buy a Yang 2020 bumper sticker and put it on your car -- it's the easiest / most effective way of spreading his name!! Everywhere you go, the yang gang will spread like a wildfire!!  üöó
#####
tHE ESTABLISHMENT WILL NOT LET ANYONE WIN UNLESS ITS THEIR PICK.....TRUMP OR BIDEN WILL WIN ....SOMEONE LIKE  YANG, BERNIE THE TWO WITH GOOD IDEAS WILL NOT WIN
#####
Love this guy, except the assumption that his monthly allowance of 1k for everybody---the "Freedom Dividend"--- would pay for itself by recirculating into local economies, might be naive. Who's to say that folks wouldn't just spend that extra 1k on Amazon or other online retailers? Am I missing something here??
#####
Andrew Yang impressing people everywhere he goes.
#####
Wow, what a guy that has his head on straight with actual solutions. It's like Bernie but, smart.... I'll be looking into Yang!
#####
Just my opinion, but if this dude and Gabbard joined up on an independent ticket, they would wipe the floor w the D's and R's.
#####
This is the only Democrat I would vote. He has correctly given a reasonable high tax system that does not appear to be taking from the rich and giving the poor. He gives to everyone üõÄ
#####
Love Yang! Âä†Ê≤πÔºÅ

WTF Youtube? Why are you autoplaying me into this trash?
#####
I fucking like what he's gotta say!! #yanggang
#####
I used an automated urinal. Left a YangGang sticker on it. He right, everything is automated. Yang Gang Nation
#####
Finally a mainstream person brought up how much we spend on defense without people asking how we're gonna pay for it!
#####
Definitely the kind of president you need. Sadly he's not the one you're going to get. We've been through this before, back when the whole Internet loved Bernie Sanders and seemed to think he was a shoe-in. Yet somehow it became Hilary vs Trump. And now it's going to be Biden vs Trump.
#####
BERNIE 2020 (but yang gang can be vice)
#####
So are we taxed $12,000.00 more income a year?
#####
its funny how close their chairs are that they practically kiss trying to sit down
#####
yeah and that 12,000 a year will go right back to buying at Amazon...they will get their money back and so the malls are still screwed.  There should be an additional incentive to not just give it to everyone but to get it you have to contribute to society...say volunteer work or some other work to help the community.  Or even take the money he wants to tax and turn those malls into community centers that have healthcare and places for the elderly etc.
#####
This guy wants to give Donald trump a 1000 a month.
#####
Yang Gang. Help me out. Why does Mayor Pete have 5M views on this show? Lot more then Yang.
#####
Even though I personally don't like Trump, I appreciate Yang's passive way of addressing him.
He only ever makes lighthearted jokes towards him, and doesn't bother with going out of his way to insult him. It's such a breath of fresh air in terms of the typical hostility that politics provides.
#####
Hopefully yang makes it so Canada can follow his example
#####
How exactly does $1k in the pockets of laymen each month "BOOST THE ECONOMY"?  Most people will just be spending that money right back on amazon, maybe the local liquor store and tobacco store and mega-chain grocer.  Won't do much.  The idea that everyone wil just give all that money to "local street stores" or whatever is pretty idyllic.
#####
I want to cry.. he makes me so excited
#####
Bill Maher is so annoying in this interview
#####
Time for Maher to do a reboot interview with Yang now ranking 4th and 5th in National polls.  Maher's earlier Klobuchar interest is almost becoming laughable at this stage.
#####
From June to December, Andrew Yang outlasted Booker, Harris and the others and is still growing his base. He's a uniter. I've watched many die hard trumpers jump off that sinking ship, switch parties and are ready to vote for Yang in 2020. He's a lit match and the sparks are catching fire. We're about to witness a full fury eruption of Andrew Yang mania across the country...when he's the nominee, there's no way in hell he won't win against the orange twat without some serious election rigging and fraud taking place.
#####
I like Yang, but I do have 2 points of contention:
1. I'm quite libertarian, so hearing the government is going to do this massive program does make me wince. But much more importantly...
2. I've always thought that all careers serve the ultimate career: parenthood
Being paid to look after your own child... that's so hollow. I'm 20 and I know I want to be a father when I'm ready, but I would NEVER expect to be paid to look after my kids. I'd do it as any parent should, out of love
#####
People do not find purpose from their jobs.  People who cant find any other value in their life find purpose in their jobs or religion.
#####
I think the crowd is driving bill crazy.lol
#####
Why does it seem like everyone who interviews him take his whole stance as joke.. so disrespectful ughh üôÑüôÑüôÑ
#####
PLEASE DONATE @ yang2020.com, as of now we've raised $936,032 out of $3 million needed by Dec. 31, 2019 at 11:59 PM. Anything helps. Upvote this so it can be seen. Thanks! #yanggang

"No! The system here is absolutely perfect! If anyone is struggling, it's their own damn fault.... 
It's because they're lazy bums, who don't want to work.....

One second of this man's data-driven replies has more substance than an entire hour of the current President's ramblings.
#####
Andrew Yang is making sense. Last night‚Äôs debate demonstrated to this voter why Yang deserves our full attention. Two main¬† Andrew Yang policy positions resonate with me, Universal Income and how the¬†Robot Apocalypse can bring our divided nation together.¬† The dark side of automation is a looming issue creating deep chasms in our already divided nation.¬† Consider how well our current Executive in chief exploited this group‚Äôs legitimate feelings of economic loss. We are in the midst of a major transition to¬†artificial intelligence¬†(see automation).¬† The President has blamed immigrants when the clear nemesis is¬†Artificial intelligence-the advance of technology. Imagine how farmers felt during the genesis of the industrial age.

Let‚Äôs look at truck drivers. There are 3.5 million truck drivers on the road today (robot trucks will be here within 3-5 years and quickly replacing drivers). The savings are considerable ( replacing human drivers with self-driving trucks that can run all of the time) will save an estimated $168 Billion a year.¬†¬†Artificial intelligence¬†is replacing thousands of call center jobs right now. About 8% of American jobs are in the STEM field, 92% are not. The 5 most common jobs in the U.S. right now are 1) Administrative and clerical 2)¬† Retail and Sales 3) food service 4) Truck Driving 5) Manufacturing. Right now all aforementioned jobs are in the midst of a change to Artificial intelligence (automation).¬† 32% of Americans graduated from college, 68% with a high school diploma or below. 68% of Americans are working in the at-risk to automation industries.¬† ¬† We need an interim solution for the margins to keep the most at risk from going off the rails-into much more expensive societal concerns (incarceration, homelessness, drug addiction, emergency room healthcare).¬† Remember an extra $1000.00 for the average working American, living paycheck to paycheck, would largely end up right back into the economy in the form of retail, deferred car repair payments, dining out, out of pocket healthcare costs.¬† This purchase activity would result in revenue back to the states/Fed.¬† We would see the revenue back and save on societal shared marginal costs. ¬†Easy to take the jaded view and consider these payments a form of welfare. ¬†Remember that we practice corporate welfare every year by allowing companies to pay the equivalent of ZERO income taxes. ¬†Why not ask these companies benefiting from automation to provide a dividend back to all of us and especially those displaced by automation?

¬†

‚ÄúThe monthly stipend, which Yang dubs the ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù is intended to ameliorate economic insecurity, wealth inequality,¬† and the other symptoms of social malaise stemming from capitalism‚Äù.

Honda Wang, Jacobin

¬†¬†

Automation is more efficient than¬† ‚Äì human labor. Automation is more efficient by any metric.¬† ¬† Robots, not immigrants are causing economic dislocations.¬†Ask yourself how loyal any company is to your interests when it comes to their bottom line (see profit).¬† Do we protest the inevitable accelerating transition towards greater efficiency or address this problem with a practical solution- see Universal income?¬† Practical solutions or protesting the inevitable?¬† Time to manage the transition. Time to take a look at Andrew Yang.

But if Amazon still doesn't pay any fed tax, how can the gov collect part of the company's earnings to support the universe income?
#####
UBI or Freedom Dividend or $1,O0O A month for all adults income should only goes to people making 250K a year salary. Bill Maher don't mind that cause he's a multi millionaire.
#####
Bill thinks ubi will suddenly cause ppl to have no reason to get out of bed?! How out of touch. Think of all the overwhelmed Americans struggling to make ends meet, suddenly having that weight lifted. The financial relief will have the exact opposite effect.
#####
I want him and Tulsi in Bernie's cabinet.
#####
the politics are fear of him because he will resurrect the country
he will work on holidays fuck thanksgivings and xmas vote him
#####
Yang needs to be put at the helm or we will sink and then burn!

‚úùÔ∏è ANDREW YANG üíüüá∫üá∏
#####
Disgusting media,..not interested in an innovative way who wants to solve problems. If america doesn't understand him, i think america would face turmoil and chaos. Why the hell did they laugh when he said he would give you a freaking 1000 dollars into your pocket which he says that it is ur money and Im giving it back to you. And he also says how he does it..why the heck people don't get this shit. In the little time he had on mic he gave some spot on answers to real world problems. Just because he is not white NBC didnt give him the time he deserved. By the way, he didnt even blame trump as an excuse,food for thought.I'm not an american and I'm watching this video from india , then I checked the latest polls and guess what ,america still thinks he is not the right candidate. Its like you know all the answers but eh..he is not suitable..wth?.I'm rooting for america to make the right decision.
#####
Mr. Yang never feel bad for being the smartest person in the room.
#####
my boy he was so nervous at first debate. Glad to see him grow, he is human being like us
#####
Whoa NBC, PLEASE remove this video ASAP! You're not supposed to be covering Andrew Yang (or John Yang), remember? You're supposed to exclude him from all coverage, just as how you've been doing it for the last 9+ months.


Whoever uploaded this video is gonna get the talk from Brian Roberts @ Comcast.

#####
Andrew Yang hit the 2M dollar campaign doantion goal by November 30. Right on the dot. 
     1.5M dollars were generated in the last 2 days, with people donating as little as 1 dollar. Yang has become the People's Candidate indeed! Amazing!!!
        His ideas and policies are now beginning to clearly and strongly resonate all across the Country. 
      We are going all the way. Yang 2020!
#####
Here is the bottom line... All of the Democratic party hopefuls are OLD, Dont understand what the modern world is or how to deal with it... and keep offering the same old "solutions" to new problems... Yang is the ONLY ONE that actually makes sense and offers potential solutions to new problems using new mindset... He may NOT be 100% correct, BUT he is still more correct in this thinking than the rest of them combined...

If the DNC does NOT nominate Yang as the presidential candidate from Democratic Party, Trumps wins and will be the president for another 4 years...
Oh, and i seriously dont think Russia is the biggest threat...its some bullshit nonsense that was invented to justify why Hillary lost to Trump... China is a LOT bigger threat than Russia or Iran or anyone else...
#####
He didn't mean to say "asses" lmao
#####
Guys... I think I switched to blue. My fam is gonna hate me now but *I. Don't. Care.* This guy will literally make one fo the best presidents in history
#####
Joe Biden don't know a thing he's talking about.
#####
In A nutshell he's admitted like all the other Democrats he's NWO/Agenda21 aka World Order/Open Border 1 Global Gov't since NWO didn't go over so we'll with all of Humanity when first announced back in '91. When we learned what the Agenda21 consists of . and has said exactly what people want to hear, which is how the world order has gained the momentum it has for decades. Wake the fk up and look into their Agenda21, Humanity literally depends on it
#####
How would you answer one to two words only to any questions which are not yes or no, dumb a--?
#####
Everyone is looking at Yang like... "if he's not President. He will be my V.P.
#####
The fact that these ideas even have to be mentioned shows how bad the economy has gotten
#####
I really like Andrew Yang. We don‚Äôt need drama in government. We need someone who understands automation and how that‚Äôs going to take out thousands of jobs in the coming 5 years. YANG 2020.
#####
I love this. I never ever was into politics but I cannot stand Trump. GO YANG üá∫üá∏
#####
Why are there time limits on ideas and what people have to say on making our world a better place to live???
#####
you can see all the other candidates tolerating yang and looking at him like the weird kid but he really has the best ideas, is the most savy, and speaks much differently than most of the others.the presidential age limit should be 35 to 55.
#####
AAP NEA KHUD APKE PASE ROKE MAINE NAHI MERA PAYMENT KARTEW CHODE DETA SUB PAYMENT
#####
Fast forward 4 months and 4 of the candidates up on that stage have dropped out and Yang is still doing well! Go Andrew!!
#####
This is the 2nd debate i hear Warren clearing her throat when Yang talks....
#####
I have a feeling NBC posted this video cuz of all the complaints that they didn't give Yang the time he deserved
#####
Technologies are becoming the most important part in our daily lives. Computers and robotics are replacing everything such as reading(no more paper books), writing(we text), communicating, driving(robot automatic system no need drivers), eating(no need waitress or cashiers).  Our world is changing and none of these candidates understand that our government system need to change also, except for the young Asian guy candidate. Big tech companies like google, apple, amazon, facebook...etc are destroying all the jobs by human labor and closing all the local businesses.  These companies don't pay tax. Their Ceos just keep getting richer and the Americans are getting poorer.  So we need a government system to re-circulate the trillions of dollars from these rich CEOs and tech companies back to the average Americans.  These money can be used to pay each american dividend. It will work.
#####
I cannot believe MSNBC are so rude compared to FOX ! WTF ??  Andrew Yang is the only person smart enough to beat Trump.  Yang 2020.

‚ÄúHe appeared without a tie.‚Äù He appeared without a tie Bc he is a winner üíØüî•
#####
I get Goosebumps when he says "It is not left, It is not right, it is forward".. Unite the People.. This is the President we have needed for SO long.
#####
This man is brilliant
#####
"It is FORWARD" yes i love it! Hes super smart
#####
Andrew Yang, I feel he is a very visionary and economically minded person, stimulating domestic demand and stimulating the economy. Although the $1,000 seems to be given to civilians, it will actually return to the US financial system. Resolving the unemployment problem and encouraging the development of artificial intelligence and automation industries will greatly stimulate the American industry. If the United States is full of blood and resurrected, do not waste resources in unnecessary places. If the United States is crazy about developing science technology and industry. America can be really great
#####
YANG IS MUCH SMARTER THEN ALL THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
#####
While yang is speaking, the others are just watching yang.....like little children learning from their elder. Smart man.
#####
"It's not left, it's not right, it's forward".....so good. I'm Canadian and I hope he wins.
#####
It seems like the media don't care about anything but who's gonna look good as president. Pppffffss. We need a smarter man in office, we need Andrew Yang
#####
This asian know his math

America is to ignorant to vote for Yang

He is indeed the proof that the democracy still works ;)
#####
When Yang speaks the other candidates take notes.
#####
people may vote trump instead of biden because trump is doing more to save the country while biden will just go back to ACA which didn't work well with many people
the democrats should have a true problem solver as their leader and that is Yang
#####
I think I just fell in love.
#####
Wow how is this guy not the obvious choice? All of those other idiots on stage are just narcissists in suits
#####
I swear he's the only one that ever actually explains anything. Everyone else just says "this will happen if you vote for me because this is a BIG PROBLEM!!!!". Like, I get it, we need to "unite as a country" and "solve ____ crisis". Can you tell me how that's gonna happen though? Seriously.
#####
Who has the brightest and practical  ideas in the debat?   Hint, the guy who is good with MATH!!!
#####
UBI and VAT are both pluses on their own, using one to pay for the other is genius!
VAT taxes can get funds from amazon, tourists, drug dealers and black market businesses, tax dodgers and illegals..
UBI can ease spending on police, welfare and health care, plus stimulate the retail sector.
So much win..

Yes, some people will use UBI to never leave the couch..
But people with that attitude already spend all the time they can on the couch, but with UBI they don't need to fund their lifestyle by doing something desperate, like prostitution or robbing your freakin house!!
#####
I‚Äôm only liking this because of Andrew.
#####
Make America Think Hard.
#####
I hope he win..i want to see Washington  be Chinatown
#####
He's the only one saying anything.
#####
I'm not a Democrat by any means but andrew is the only candidate on the democratic side that I think would be a good president. I wouldn't vote for anyone else on the left, way too radical.
#####
Andrew or Tulsi would be the only way the left can redeem themselves.
#####
Shame on your NBC. You know you did Yang wrong.
#####
remember when they pushed hilary instead of bernie and she lost? 
This guy should go head to head with bernie, drop joe already.

I would like to see him and Trump go head to head

Andrew Yang sooo cool

I'm 15 and I understand exactly what he is saying

Fixing the US relationship with China is good before China works with Russia to destroy the US because Trump has made lots of enemies around the world for the US.

I like his idea of getting 1000 per month..Gun control  Big ideas
#####
do ppl actually think this guy makes sense?
#####
So Yang says tax Amazon X amount to give to the "peasants"  so Amazon loses their gain each year so less money given to the Peasants each year until it is all gone..........hmmmm sounds like Socialism.
#####
I agree with Yang with everything except on his stance with the CCP. You can never deal with those guys. They only take and they give nothing in return.
#####
Yep I‚Äôll give you $1,000. Month if you vote for me. Let me buy you. And some other time he said $1,000 for 10 families. Where does he stand with all that money. Creep gangster. Yea really who can beat D. Trump? ......................

Ref: How exactly would you do that?
Yang: HUH!?
#####
A boy or a man spends time with a girl or woman who is important to him. The girl/woman exudes excitement. Time is given on what is important. The media gives Yang the least amount of time during these debates; this is a strategy they implement to subliminally convey the message that Yang is NOT THAT important, compared to the OTHERS on the stage - the politicians. But, they do appear to respect him by asking him a few seemingly serious questions. (Because Americans want the optics of respect - the appearance that somehow, some degree of respect has been accorded.) The Yang Gangs, as smart as they are, will have to work on this subtle (but, really, quite obvious) maneuver by the corporate interests. :)
#####
Yang 2020! 

What are you voters waiting for?

Asian-American when they can move to the top like this, They must be very smart and genius.

....Where can I donate for this candidate??
#####
My vote is not for sale.

I wish him and Bernie could team up UHC and UBI could do wonders for this countrt. Bernie is for our physical health and Yang is for mental heath.

An estimated $35,880,000,00,000 a year, if you do the calculations basing how many US citizens over 18 which is around 290,000,000, and multiplying it by by 1 thousand and multiplying it by 12 for each month, he claims he will just get around $35,880,000,00,000 to spend each year not including all the money and debt the US already has and spends, this fucking guy...

Great. Curious about the circumcison question! Am I manspalianing or if this had been 'stop female genital muticlation' Yang WOUDL NOT have diluted his answer to Steve on it? Yep. mansplaining.

Listen to Andrew Yang go in details about his policy on Joe Rogan's podcast

#####
Yang is the Democrats version of Trump!! He talks about crap he can't back up; he dresses like a real estate agent in a strip club, not a President; he uses his moderate fame to boost greater fame, rather than a true progressive movement in America. He is more like Trump in so many ways that its not even funny, and yet Democrats are stupid enough (collectively) to want to believe he has a message behind his empty words. He's not a good candidate, and he will distract from the 2020 election, possibly taking votes away from a Donald Trump-free world.

So I'm not big on politics, I'm 19 and I've never wanted to vote before, but couldnt giving 1k to every American backfire? Like there's plenty of 18 yo with no job and no desire to move out of their parents home, whats the point of giving a lazy bones money for not doing anything? Also what about homeless people? And especially what about the crackhead down the street? Are they gonna get free money as well?

‚ùó*IMPORTANT*‚ùó: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines!

I can‚Äôt understand one thing, if a 1000$ given to anyone 18+ every month, simple calculations lead to 112,8 million people getting 112,8 billion monthly total. That results in 1128 billions of dollars annually or 1.1 trillion/year roughly. In statistics the BoP, Net income of whole USA was around 250 billions/year. I‚Äôm sorry for all US citizens, yes, 1000$ would change someone‚Äôs life, but it‚Äôs not technically/financially achievable. Even if this happens, inflation will go through the roof and the new iPhone will cost around 10,000$, BigMac will cost 250$. 
Yes, you get 1000$ but all you would have ability to buy now is 4 hamburgers. 
Am I missing something, maybe someone could enlighten me on this topic, as from my understanding it is impossible for country with capitalism make everyone happy and wealthy

This is great because for two decades our tax dollars have gone to make corporations and rich people richer also to unnecessary military spending that only made defense contractors and manufacturers rich as we remain at war this long. The overall economy is doing well and in the richest country in the world we have the highest poverty out of the richest nations and the only one that has a high number of people without health care and around half of American workers' incomes are at or below the poverty lines. This dividend does not go to the government or rich corporations but straight to the people. If Yang is not the nominee the DNC still need to adopt this. Corporatist Democrats and Republicans move aside you got your piece of the pie it's our turn now.

I like Yang's focus on American's quality of life, however the freedom dividend cannot possibly rely solely on taxes on tech companies or big corporations in general. There are currently over 209 million adults in America. If they all got 1k a month then we'd be spending 209 billion a month. Just to use Amazon as an example they make roughly one billion a month. Let's say we take all of their profit, even then where will the other 208 billion come from? Obviously other companies but even then there's no way all big corporations could afford 209 billion a month. Yang said these companies make trillions a year and that's just not the case. Amazon makes about 10 billion, Google makes 100 billion, nothing around that trillion dollar mark.
#####

Andrew Yang has a great vision to help others. But so did Jacques Fresco 
( https://youtu.be/PIMy0QBSQWo ), Buckminster Fuller ( https://youtu.be/V8U1kehhVd4 ) , and many others who _several decades before Andrew Yang_ proposed ways and alternatives to take care of all humanity while intelligently managing our earth's finite resources. I encourage all to not only vote for UBI but also look up these other great thinkers and consider their ideas of changing our society in unprecedented ways.

Not saying he‚Äôs not the best candidate but everything he‚Äôs talking about is what prior generations like mine spoke about way back.  Odd, people get religion when it‚Äôs going to hurt a certain skin color.  Then, we seem to find solutions.  AI is further off than he makes it out to be.  The closest I‚Äôve ever seen is AI like BabyX.  These are emotion driven AI through CNN.  See Soul Machines on YouTube.  Type BabyX.

The USA can pull poverty out of this world. Imagine Americans have the opportunity to flood the US market with 23 trillion dollars every month that channel  back to all busineses that create jobs through purchase of goods and services and manufacturing. This can provide a chain reaction that can trigger the best economic boom of American history. Andrew Yang's idea surely work.

What's the point of a dividend when the dollar keeps losing its value ?
#####
his big idea is to give everyone 1k while increasing taxes by 10%? you will have lost that money in a week and still be stuck paying more taxes than ever before. Its a bad joke.
#####
Yang gang

I honestly think he will not win, his policy is too extreme for a lot of people and the key to getting votes is being in the middle.

Dude this guy bout to be elected for the balance to of money in this society!

This is called bribery to become president
#####
Human capital? Investing in people?

If we think of people in a city as stocks we can then compare each stock to find the risk of investment and get some idea of a rate of return on our investment.

Given that the highest skilled professions are also the highest paid professions it would be wise to invest in those people who are most likely to achieve those positions and repay our investment in them through the taxes they pay and the services they provide and the potential jobs they create should they start businesses.

Those people most likely to achieve high skilled high paid professions also happen to be those people with above average IQs.

In fact every person with an IQ below 105 is 6 times more costly to society in terms of incarceration rates, drug abuse and productivity and utility. 

So if we want to maximize our return on our human capital we should pay those with IQs below 100 not to have children while at the same time providing incentives to those with IQs above 100 to have more children and provide those children with safe places to live where they can attend the highest quality schools and universities free from distractions and harassment from those people who would not produce an acceptable return on our investment.

In a few generations we will be up to our ears in doctors and engineers and scientists.

Then the wages in those careers will plummet due to the law of supply and demand

IF Robots r taking all jobs then WHAT work does YANG think people will find?

UBI_2
WHY UBI COSTS FAR LESS THAN YOU THINK 
‚Ä¢      Both critics and even many supporters don‚Äôt understand how much the program would really cost. To calculate the cost, most people just multiply the size of the monthly income (say, $1,000) by the population (it‚Äôs universal, after all) and ‚Äì voil√† ‚Äì a number that seems impossibly expensive.
‚Ä¢      But this is not how much UBI costs. The real cost ‚Äì the amount of money that actually needs to be taken from someone and redistributed to someone else ‚Äì is just a small fraction of these estimates.
‚Ä¢      The key to understanding the real cost of UBI is understanding the difference between the gross (or upfront) and net (or real) cost. Here‚Äôs a simple example: imagine a room with 15 people who want to set up a UBI for the room of $2 per person. The upfront cost of the policy would be $30. The ten richest people in the room are asked to contribute $3 each towards funding it. After they each put in $3, raising the total $30 needed, every person in the room gets their $2 universal basic income. But because the ten richest people in the room contributed $3, and then got $2 back as the UBI, their real, net contribution is in fact $1 each. So the real cost of the UBI is $10.
‚Ä¢      Estimates that just multiply the size of the UBI by the population of a country do the equivalent of claiming that the cost of UBI in the room above is a whopping $30. But the real cost in this scenario ‚Äì the money redistributed from the wealthy ‚Äì is only $10.
‚Ä¢      The billionaire‚Äôs dilemma
‚Ä¢      It‚Äôs important to understand who will be gaining money through a UBI and who will be contributing to it. The common mistake is to double count the net contributors. Yes, they get a UBI, but in contributing to the UBI pot they first return their UBI, and then throw in some money on top of that. So it‚Äôs incorrect to count them when calculating the true UBI cost.
‚Ä¢      This is a fundamental point that often gets missed: those that are taxed to pay for the UBI will get some of that cost back ‚Äì by getting their UBI. You can also think about it in reverse: while the UBI goes to everyone, the rich in effect give it back in the first chunk of taxes they pay, so you don‚Äôt need to count their UBI in cost estimates.
‚Ä¢      Dilemma solved. 
‚Ä¢      This also resolves UBI‚Äôs ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù ‚Äì why give someone like Bill Gates a basic income? The answer is that Gates would simply return that UBI through his taxes ‚Äì and help pay for others. But if Gates becomes suddenly destitute, the UBI will still be showing up for him to use every month. And since his tax bill will drop, he‚Äôll become a net beneficiary rather than contributor.
‚Ä¢      True costs
‚Ä¢      Any UBI estimate that just multiplies the size of the UBI by the population is a red flag that the cost has been over-inflated. A true cost estimate will always discuss who the net beneficiaries will be, who the net contributors will be, and the rate at which we gradually switch people over from being beneficiaries to being contributors as they get richer (this is sometimes called the claw-back rate, the withdrawal rate or the marginal tax rate ‚Äì which is not an overall tax, but simply the rate at which people start to return their UBI to the communal pot as they earn more).
‚Ä¢      Cost estimates that consider the difference between upfront and real cost are a fraction of inflated gross cost estimates. For instance, economist and philosopher Karl Widerquist has shown that to fund a UBI of US$12,000 per adult and US$6,000 per child every year (while keeping all other spending the same) the US would have to raise an additional US$539 billion a year ‚Äì less than 3% of its GDP. This is a small fraction of the figures that get thrown around of over US$3 trillion (the gross cost of this policy). Karl‚Äôs simplified scheme has people slowly start contributing back their UBI in taxes to the common pot as they earn, with net beneficiaries being anyone individually earning less than US$24,000 a year.
‚Ä¢      This point still holds if you‚Äôre raising money for UBI from other sources than income or wealth taxes. If you use a corporate or data tax, or a natural resource or carbon tax to finance a UBI, you are still redistributing money that would otherwise ultimately be profits that go to Google shareholders or BP executives. And you‚Äôre taking less away from them than you would think ‚Äì because they too get a UBI. So the money they end up losing through the new tax is offset by the UBI they receive. The same holds if you‚Äôre paying for a UBI by reshuffling your budget.
‚Ä¢      Some people get confused and question whether UBI is really universal if only a portion of the population actually ends up with extra income, while another portion pays for it. But any policy that is universal yet redistributory works this way. Public transit, roads and schools are all universal benefits, but some people pay a lot for their funding through their taxes, while others enjoy them for free or at a lower cost.
‚Ä¢      In light of the huge benefits available from a UBI, it‚Äôs a waste of time to argue over wildly inflated cost estimates. The numbers are out there ‚Äì we can pay for a basic income.

WHO IS FUNDING THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND - UBI, WITH THEIR VAT EXPENDITURES ?¬†
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO FUND THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND WITH THEIR VAT EXPENDITURES ARE people who have taxable income of over $160,000 a year;¬†whose net worth is over $4 million; and¬†who are in the top 3% of Americans.
 ‚Ä¢ If you spend more than $120,000 a year in purchases, you are paying more in the 10% VAT than you receive in UBI ($12,000).
 ‚Ä¢ This means your net AFTER tax income has to exceed $120,000, and this means that - 
 1. Your taxable income has to exceed $160,000, if you live in a state with no state income tax;
  https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/?iam=&salary=160000&from=year&region=Florida¬†

Cool idea. How does Yang plan to pay for this?
#####
Andrew Yang is the only candidate who is presidential material.  Americans make Andrew Yang your president.
#####
Andrew Yang is like the Eminem( üé±Mile) in politics üíØüî•üíØ

I pledge allegiance to the bag. #YangGang

Free market has been promising freedom for everybody. Now I think it's time for universal basic income to try.
There's no downside on this idea.
The free market has been promoted violence and monetary crisis.
#####
The communists already tried this big idea and it failed miserably.
#####
Andrew Yang is what American needs. Not left, nor right; but forward. I first though UBI was a ridiculous socialist idea, but after hearing his plan, it is clear that this guy is smart and wants the best for America. This is not about left or right, it's about going forward. Love this guy. Yang2020.
#####
*MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS HATE THIS GUY!*

Please share Yang to everyone you know
#####
The main stream media doesn't give him much exposure.
#####
Can someone tell me how to vote for Mr.Yang? I am in Europe and haven't voted for 9-10 years.
I remember there was a comment about 3-4 days ago saying one must first register as ....
#####
let‚Äôs secure the bag! #NEETbux

#####
Yang has my Vote! First time voting too since they would not let me vote for Ron Paul.
#####
I was raised to be a Republican, but I have to agree with him! #yang2020

Andrew yang for president the best !!!

#####
Why isn't this video on NBC News with the other candidates' Big Ideas???
#####
What happened to Mr.Yang? I did not see him at the Dem. Nat. Convention.
#####
Americans do not have to embrace their own replacement by AI, these are globalist talking points. Yang is here to provide a little lube before they completely screw you. It is a clever strategy; saturate the Democrat party with crazy, far-lefties and then roll out the straight guy in a suit. Yang is also pushing collectivism into America, but he and his globalist bosses want you to think its oK because "its only half socialism" and gosh, he sure is articulate! 'Yanggang' thinks you are stupid enough to buy more progressive lies - more "hope and change". Americans do not have to embrace their own replacement by AI or more government dependency. End the "international world order".
#####
1000 is not enough. For the economy to ensure not collapsing it has to be at least 5000

#####
First unbiased, fair interview for Yang from the MSM!!  Yang hit it into orbit!!!! Yang2020
#####
Andrew Yang, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren
#####
Andrew Yang for president, anything else is failure.
#####
GET THIS MAN A SHIELD

If u don't vote for free money u are a dumb ü¶Ü

Down with the Chinese commie. One day our tickle down economy will work and I will finally be rich. I've waited all my life and it still hasn't trickled down. But I'm going to blame all my financial problems on communists in china. White America has never been wrong
#####
I dont know why his UBI proposal is receiving hate...Look at Alaska! My cousins live there and they go on vacation everytime. Not to say they arent using their money right or anything. They work hard just as any American and they save their money. Imagine having that for your hard working parents who have never receive a vacation in 20+ years.
#####
Taxing income is an increasingly ineffective and inefficient way to 
generate revenue over time. ¬†Take a company like Amazon‚Äîit can do tens 
of billions in business and pay no income tax in a given period while 
storing its income overseas. ¬†A Value-Added Tax is much more efficient 
way to capture the true value of the American infrastructure and will be
 increasingly necessary over time as more and more work is done by 
software, robots and artificial intelligence. With a VAT of half the 
European level, we can pay for Universal Basic Income for all American 
adults of $1,000 per month.
#####
I feel like Yang is one of the few people whose top comments are love rather than trolling
#####
West Virginia better start looking up Andrew Yang.  Because coal is going bye bye.
#####
That's the worst handwriting/penmanship ever seen from an Asian-American.
#####
Yang has ideas that are giveaways He will never reach double-digit approval. Don't waste ur time.
#####
I'll take that extra 12 grand a year, sock away half of it in an index fund and save the rest to spend on a nice long beach vacation every year. That's what security and good mental health means for me.
#####
I am more interested on his "get the money out of the politics".  He should elaborate on how it can practically be carried out,  Is he going to throw out a nation wide referendum? Say, putting a cap on election campaign donation, election campaign fund from public spending budget, free air time for candidates as license conditions in MSM, or what?
#####
Harry got the value added tax wrong, he claimed Andrew was going tax 10% on goods and services. That‚Äôs not consistent withe the tech  value added tax. Totally different. #yang2020

Hey lazy useless Americans, vote for me and I'll give you 12k a year.

Taxes need to increase to pay ubi no such thing as free money
#####
Why are companies going to automation? To cut costs! It‚Äôs becoming to expensive to operate bc of government taxation and regulation. This isn‚Äôt complicated to understand that his idea will only make things more expensive.
#####
1:50 clip to discuss an idea is a joke. Why even bother talking at all
#####
So he wants to raise taxes by 10% to give money away. Sounds like every democrat ever trying to buy votes.
#####

#####
The only downside I see to this is the cost of consumer goods flowing up. I can see Apple pushing $3k phones, Mcdonalds prices going up and so forth. Other than that this is my favorite choice of nominee so far.
#####
U forgot to mention that he‚Äôs targeting the richest of the rich to pay for it via that 10% VAT tax
#####
Sad, if money solved problems than we would not be in this situation. We now see there is not enough money to satisfy rich people hatred. You have to study history to find out why, because it does repeat itself.
#####
Its not about giving people "free money". Its about forcing companies that aren't paying taxes but should be paying taxes. And then taking those tax money that should be paid and giving it to the people.
#####
Holy $hit!  Self driving cars and 18 wheelers?   No thanks.

Andrew Yang understands the technology of the future and has over 100 policies on his page to move us successfully into the future! He is also bringing people from all parties together because his ideas are solid and help every American and every community! #YangGang #Yang2020
#####
I like the idea that UBI is capitalism not starting at zero .. Yang is the most interesting candidate out there.
#####
He will be in the final four or five candidates for sure.
#####
#yanggang - humanity first!

another candidates  comes up with an ubi with $1100 a month hes fooked
#####
Yang Gang 2020!
#####
While the idea is intriguing, it wouldn't work as well as most people believe it would..


To achieve its stated aim of paying adequate sums of money to the whole population, a UBI would require an increase of gargantuan (and unaffordable) proportions in the tax burden. Yet to remain affordable, it would require payments to be so small as to leave many of our fellow citizens below the poverty line.



Furthermore, if UBI were to succeed in removing the need for large numbers of people to work at all, who would undertake those essential jobs that rely heavily upon human interaction and ingenuity‚Äîteaching, nursing and social care, for example‚Äîwhich are crucial to the common good and are likely to grow in number as our population continues to swell?
#####
Surely not his ideas.  The name may be different, but this concept has existed for years.

Lol they put ‚ÄúMy Big Idea‚Äù on a dry erase and marker graphic. That‚Äôs such an MSM thing to do. Why don‚Äôt you just have a three year old use a crayon to draw the thumbnail font. MSNBC is manipulative.

Do it in limited basis at present time and see how long your money will last. Unlikely to become president for using unrealistic publicity stunts.

I am conservative but I like this program, every american family "needs" this for their children...make it for American citizens only , no illegals

The Freedom Dividend is an investment for America's future. It provides financial security and allows people to take risk they otherwise wouldn't take. You can go to college, Buy a home or a car, Start a business and so on so forth. It's all about putting Humanity First. Yang 2020!

This should be called "My Big Stupid Idea" My goodness we cann't give food stamps to every one that needs them now But he wants to give every one $1000.
#####
Dems buy votes with tax payer money. He wants to take down already established profitable busineses to give people money to start new ones.  Truth is People will quit working for the established business so he won't have tax money to fund the $1000 he's giving away free. It doesn't work that way guys.
#####
Put ANDREW YANG back on Jimmy Kimmel!!
#####
Youtube is getting comfortable with these unskippable ads
#####
Lousy show! Improve your character!
#####
Thank you Jimmy for having Andrew Yang on your show. It was a great interview.  Thank you for the shout out.

It feels like there's an implosion of good Democratic candidates this year. I remember last time we only got Benghazi Hillary who ate up most of the Democrat party funds.
#####
"Click the subscribe button below," he says.  Nah... I'll do that once you wise up and have Andrew Yang on the show.
#####
Kimmel is funny... But he's really ignorant sometimes! Conan > Kimmel
#####
I like your show Kimmel bc you have heart and your are funny. But since you don‚Äôt know Andrew Yang maybe you should go to his website and read his 100+ policies or watch the Joe Rogan podcast.  Andrew is very very smart and genuinely care about the people and humanity.

Andrew Yang came out of nowhere for me. I thought I was set with Warren, who I do still really like, but he is the first person in my history with politics who I just get. He makes sense, he answers questions concretely and succinctly. Even if you don't agree you know why you don't based on facts not emotions. He's a game changer.
#####
Yang in the thumbnail gets you views! Invite him on your show!!!
#####
I mean, Jimmy I love your show.. but if you disrespect Andrew Yang, I can only tell you that he is better than you.

So stop acting like that please.

Jimmy don't like the idea of $1000 a month.
#####
Go Yang!!!! Make America Think Harder ( MATH)

How sad that liberals call Trump a loser. Think about that. A guy who made billions, lost billions, got it back again, had the best viewed reality show in tv history and became president of the free world. Losers can't do that. Grow up

Does jimmy think Yang is a joke? Well he‚Äôs funnier than jimmy at least

The video: some Asian guy is running for president.


The comments- My Yang Gang brethren gives me hope for humanity
#####
Yang will bring America into a new era of prosperity where everyone will have a fair chance.
#####
Andrew Yang will transform the economy for the people. Andrew Yang's 3 big plans fit together..FREEDOM DIVIDEND, MEDICARE FOR ALL, HUMAN-CENTERED CAPITALISM.  To be the greatest civilization, we need all 3 of Andrew's plans...1. Have money to spend 2. Health care for everybody 3. Measurements toward humans.  So all his policies promote humanity first and the economy exists to serve the people....His Freedom Dividend will force the economy to serve the people like he said...If these 3 things happened, United States will become the greatest civilization on Earth. A married couple with 3 adults children like this family gets $5000 a month. @t‚Äã
#####
Yang 20 20!!
#####
I wish Instead of mocking Andrew Yang Jimmy would actually invite him and talk about his ideas on how to help the economy, about health care etc Jimmy is strong resister of trump I honestly thought he would have candidates on his show
#####
Yang will lead in the polls quickly picking up momentum.
#####
Jimmy , are you part of the establishment?  It seems like all these media companies are promoting candidates who take corporate donations!  You made these empathetic videos about health care reform, about giving voice to the little guys.  And here you won't even take the only credible candidate seriously?  

I guess you will say whatever people pay you to say.  Have Andrew Yang on your show.  He's smarter than any of the candidates we have now.  Seriously, if you care about America and not just your pocket, then do something that can actually change Americans lives.
#####
Trump stomped over Kimmel.  Kimmel needs to look for a smaller fish to poke fun at.  Kimmel, the small sample clip you used didn‚Äôt show the overall picture of Andrew Yang.  If you‚Äôre curious/intrigued, put Andrew Yang in the show.  He will enlighten you!
#####
Jimmy Kimmel lives in a bubble.  So strange he hasn't heard of Yang.
#####
Yang is drawing thousands at his rallies in Seattle, LA, & NY.  Main street media is not giving Yang coverage and if they do its usually negative even though the media knows nothing about Andrew Yang.  He is drawing these large crowds even with low name recognition.  Wait until after the national debates and see what kind of support he gets when everyone knows about Yang..
People are being drawn to Yang for his ideas.  He has over 100 detailed solutions for America's problem on his web site.
Yang is the only democratic candidate addressing the issue that got Trump elected.  If the Democrats fail to address it again then Trump will probably win a second term.
Jimmy you need to research Yang, treat him fairly and have him on your show.
#####
Yang2020
#####
Vote Andrew Yang in 2020!  A vote for anyone else is like taking $1000 a month out of your wallet.

Andrew Yang should definitely be on Kimmel. He‚Äôd be great on that show. They need to have him on.
#####
Almost a worse segment than Stephen Colbert. How do you not know Andrew Yang?

Bad form Kimmel and Kimmel's producers and writers.  Dissing Yang is going to come back and haunt you big.  Give him some air time to let you know about his policies.

It's incredible how Democrat this dude is. I feel like late night shows should never get into politics.
#####
Yang gang
#####
Democrats beware. I‚Äôm a Conservative and to be honest I don‚Äôt mind some of Yang‚Äôs policies (Probably still won‚Äôt vote for him). The only thing is that establishment Democrats will most likely steal the elections from him the same way they stole it from Bernie in 2016.

That‚Äôs why so many conservatives are falsely supporting him. They know Yang will probably not move on and a lot of protest votes will be casted once he doesn‚Äôt.
#####
American politics is such a joke to the rest of the world üòÇ

Brilliant, honest, compassionate, hardworking, and with a 21st.Century mindset. 
   His approach to solving problems is so refreshing and the solutions he offers are so sensible and very much in step with the times. 
   Yang is exactly the kind of POTUS we need.

If he really cares about the US economy he will find ways to get tax-avoiding companies to pay their fair share so the government can help the poor and most needed. Giving money away to everyone like this is only going to devalue the US dollar making goods more expensive and the country less productive.

After that fiasco with the whipped cream yesterday, Andrew Yanks Himself's political career is over.   Maybe he and Buttplug can hook up.

4:51 On the issue of white nationalism; I believe that there are two types of people that are labeled as "white nationalists":
1) The actual ideologues who fully believe in the hateful rhetoric they're spewing and want to convert other people because they believe in the principles of white supremacy;
2) The disenfranchised, hopeless, frustrated folks who see white nationalists as the only people to actually speak out and relate through their charismatic demagoguery about the issues that they actually care about and want fixed.


If the second type of person, having embraced white supremacy before, finds Andrew Yang's Freedom Divident (and the rest of the platform) as an acceptable solution to their problems, they may shift over to condoning Yang. However, if they've been branded an alt-right neo-nazi before, then their support, due to lack of nuance, might be considered an endorsement by the first type of white nationalists . Which, in this transitional period, may not be too far from the truth, as I wouldn't be surprised a lot of these anxious, cautious people wouldn't be willing to completely renounce their beliefs just to put their weight behind Yang, and would rather just support both sides simultaneously.


If Yang becomes president, and his Freedom Divident actually works out, I believe it will have a de-radicalizing effect on a lot of these disenfranchised people who got subverted into a rhetoric of hate out of frustration and a feeling of powerlessness.

The whole white nationalist question is stupid to me. Americans have many different beliefs and groups they may participate in .how can the candidate know all the details of his supporters and if he does should he ignore their needs ?  he has to represent everyone ass best he can. It's not like he personally knows everyone who donates or votes for him . dumb question in my humble opinion.

Yang is an incredible moron! If there is that much money than there is zero excuse to ever cut Social Security a dime ever!  Let the free loader earn theirs like those before them. All this idiot would do is inflate the shit out of our money and destroy those that already earned their Social Security ! As the idiot didn't think to include them. Remember Democrats stole the social security  money to fund their Vietnam war!  There are plenty of unfunded liabilities . Without starting a free bee give away for those that didn't earn it!  Yang is an idiot! LOOKING FOR SUCKERS! And the inflation he would cause would make our money worthless. I am sure China would love this idiots plan. Maybe he works for them!

Andrew you are crazy guys no body votes for you

unfortunately I wish the other candidates were picking up his ideas. Wow we seem clueless as a nation

How is Biden on top? How?

"I'm a stay at home mom and I don't work so that $1,000 will really help." Well, yeah you don't work so why do you think you deserve $1,000? You have done literally nothing. Get a job.

Wait into law goes through Congress and congress goes through lobbies so the law would be impossible because it would be rejected by the lobbies officials of the congress. The lobbyists work for the congress offices. They are the secretaries that make the phone calls to people that have money free to spare for a few months to use in a couple of places. So those secretaries would just need to type the words and then deliver the words to the congress offices and then to the over office of the White House and the American people get freedom for life. But the chances are impossible because the first step isn‚Äôt there the last step is

I was for Bernie but Yang gives me hope and makes me think positive. My vote is for Yang #Yanggang

Yang can debate anyone. He's smart, quick, logical, facts driven. Anyone who debates him will be stunned.

VOTE for Andrew Yang, he is the right man we all dreamed and wanted to be in the white house.   Prepare to vote for Andrew.  He is tbe answer to all problems in America.
#####
Andrew Yang for President!
#####
It is about time we have someone can talk like Yang. He touched me so I will vote for him.
#####
If I got 1000$ a month I would invest it in the stock market.

$1,000 a month for 360 million Americans??? 
Really hate when politicians promise things for free on either side...
#####
Voted for Trump last time, but will do for Yang this round... BUT seriously, seriously doubt Dem Party has the BRAIN to nominate Yang!  They are too dumb to beat Trump!  HUSH HUSH....
#####
Y‚Äôall just look up the PFD in Alaska and understand why this isn‚Äôt practical

If Andrew Yang doesn‚Äôt become president i am literally going to cry.

Yang has all the parts to win the way Trump did. 


The only difference is that he's doing it on purpose.


I'll be toasting his inauguration, or the end of humankind next year

What are the cons of universal base income? As in the economic shifts, house market, food prices, gas prices, all other products, would it increase their prices and if that ubi, it's per say" good" what's are the shifts?

Andrew is a walking computer with so much valid data. He's "ANDROID" Yang.
#####
I think calculators don't know how to do math, because 250,000,000 x 1000 x 12 = 3,000,000,000,000.
That can't be right, because Andrew Yang is the Asian man who likes math.

CAN't GET ENOUGH OF THIS GUY--- WE NEED TO HEAR + LEARN FROM ANDREW YANG MOREEEEE!!!!

1k a month......go YANG2020!!!!!!
#####
Millenials it is him we will vote for 2020

1K is nothing help people get a job, but that point you have time to find a good job you wanna.

And who's going to be paying the taxes to give that money?

Was definitely fixed on voting for Bernie.


But after doing some research on Yang- it's safe to say I am now in the Yang Gang.


Just donated one dollar :)

Republican voters need to stay on point
Do not make the mistake the demotard voters made, a lot voted Bernie in the general election

If people who are unwilling to work get a handout, then minimum wage workers should too.

I'm a capitalist , business owner republican, I really am.
#####
THE REPORTER LOOKS LIKE JIM CAREY..LIAR LIAR !!
#####
Yang is for the people!
#####
I really don't like the way the anchor dismissed Yang's commentary about GDP. Yang made the very valid point that GDP is not representative of overall public health and well-being, such as life-expectancy, and all the smug reporter can say is that GDP moves markets. Well, sir, market health is reflective of the health of businesses, not the people themselves!  And please don't get me started on the job creation BS. The vast majority of those jobs are underpaid, low-skill, non-secure, poorly or non-benefitted type jobs that NO ONE wants to take but they have to because they need to live. Universal income is not a final solution, but it will at least relieve the stress nearly all Americans feel about bills and such. Yang has my vote.
#####
I lean more towards the right but I can tell that Andrew Yang truly does care about the American people.
#####
Let the man answer the question Fox or at least finish his sentence. It‚Äôs not reporting when you just interrupt people when you don‚Äôt agree with them. Like Yang in the interview, unlike Fox.
#####
What's with Fox correspondents cutting off interested mid sentence when they're trying to get a point across?
#####
It‚Äôs not a phantom hand, it‚Äôs a invisible hand.
#####
it is a welfare.
#####
Wow, Andrew Yang is a brilliant man! He's smart, respectful, and humble.
#####
He got this !
#####
the reporter should be fired

I‚Äôm donating to his campaign when I get my next check.

This is probably the best democratic candidate in the past 3 elections. But democrats don‚Äôt have the wisdom to see it
#####
These arbitrary labels  of "Liberal", "Progressive" and "Conservative" are distractions from the underlying issues faced by the people. Andrew Yang wants to evolve beyond this limited boxing mentality and pushes for "Not Left, Not Right but Forward". He purposefully doesn't answer the hosts last question and redirects the discussion to issues. Love it. Andrews a witty guy.
#####
If he was running for the conservative party, his votes would have been much higher. Because he is talking good stuff..  and he almost appear neutral, neither right or left.

If it ain't a hand out then what is it?  Funny  how clever the conversation can get when talking about giving away something for free.  The logic is that AI will make people useless and therefore unable to earn a living so we will give them $1K a month to survive and thrive.  Hey Dang Yang, most peoples rent or mortgage is at least $1K a month.  Okay you paid the rent and or the mortgage now what?  You gonna pay the property tax too?  The Utilities, the phone bill? The internet connection? The healthcare payment?  The insurance on the house or the car? The kids tuition?  Pension payments? Taxes on all that free money?  Even the SSI income is taxed even though people paid into it.   Don't make any sense math genius.
#####
I wish he would stop cutting him off
#####
Sounds to me like a Socialist with fancy ideas.  This Yang dude is buying votes!.
#####
After hearing Yang personally go through his stances on H3H3 podcast on many of the things the interviewer just listed off as if they were fact, it's amazing how much this interviewer misrepresented Yang's stances on literally every single one and yet Yang didn't try to chase the squirrels or correct him.

It's nice to see someone who can rise above the scummy tactics of some interviewers and focus on answering the questions they ask - or answering the questions they *should've* asked instead!
#####
I still think a universal income simply won‚Äôt work, but Yang seems very down to earth and genuine. I don‚Äôt really like his policies, but it seems that he wants to better American people, not his political career, so props to him.
#####
Ngl sometimes hardworking people get hurt, and have a really tuff time actually staying afloat
#####
I never register to vote in my life. But I'm definitely voting for Andrew Yang.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
"What changes for people when you give them 1000 a month?" Oh my god these people.
#####
I can't make up my mind to vote for Yang or Biden.....I like Yang but I love Biden's senility. Seniors are so cute when they can't remember where they are
#####
Andrew yang Is just a socialism guy, I thought the US was against socialism
#####
Andrew Yang sure has came a long way since this!
#####
Andrew Yang is a gem amongst many lumps of coal. Rock on, this older Conservative (who understands the world and the US is changing) is listening.
#####
so basic income will eliminate welfare, SSI, section 8  , food stamps  etc .  that mean single mom with one child will get same $ 1000 as single mom with 3 children ??

When there is no discretionary giving such as let's put $1,000 into the pocket of every drug addict in America, aren't we sabotaging our economy by becoming one big oligarch. We don't want to become like ancient Nineveh where they apparently didn't know the difference between their right and left hand.
#####
A hand out is when the government dips into the human tax base to redistribute our dollars to others. A UBI is funded by an external resource, in this case revenue generated by Amazon, Google, etc. We don't pay into it unless we buy from these companies.
#####
When you are registered as a democrat but even the Fox News viewers cant shut you down. Keep an eye out for this guy folks, he cuts straight for the meat and doesnt falter. Impressive
#####
do you know how many Americans are over 18 in this country? 209,000,000 people. That's a total revenue of $209,000,000,000 every month. Absurd and Never gonna happen, lying to the American people.
#####
Hmm, a moderate who isn‚Äôt slinging republican or democratic mud? I‚Äôll take a $1000 a month and not use it on drugs. I‚Äôm basically getting some of my taxes back so I can use it on my family. Better than than a rich guy tax break for a new yacht.
#####
This Sounds like Socialism to me.
#####
Why isnt he bringing up alaska?
#####
Oh my gooooooosh stop cutting the man off!!! Let him finish his sentences!!!!
#####
Because Andrew yang is so genuine and not bashing other candidates is the exact reason he won‚Äôt win the dem vote. Pretty sad honestly
#####
The news castor is annoying.
#####
He never once explained how we'd pay for this. 

Democrats know little about financial responsibility
#####
I'm a republican but I might vote for him. At least, I wouldn't mind if he was voted into office.
#####
the only problem with yang is he's not tall and handsome..... very beta male persona....
#####
This is what people should picture when they think of a political figure/candidate. As a conservative, it‚Äôs refreshing to see a calm, respectable person in the race, even if he‚Äôs a democrat.
#####
All these positive Yang comments yet no reflection in the polls. PEOPLE WHERE YOU AT
#####
Jesus he is clearly a puppet of someone but who the hell is it?
#####
Hi, Registered GOP here. That was a Lame interview. "Who do u think is the most liberal on the board?" Also kept interrupting him, and u just listed a bunch of stuff he's for that most conservatives are not for. Didn't ask HOW he was gonna implement his Universal Income idea. Yang is someone to take seriously, and not as an opponent of Trump, but a legitimate presidential option.
#####
Universal Basic Income is just
Socialism, which is always closely
followed by Communism, might
sound good to some folks but
IS NOT SUSTAINABLE !!
Social Security got a measly 1.6%
increase for 2020, and is supported by folks paying a tax
on Income. The so called Freedom
Dividend is supported by Fantasy !!
#####
Vote for Yang. This man never talks politics or divides Americans, he's laying down real solutions to real problems, and that's what he cares about. Ignore party labels or media fueled two-party BS, this man is who we need.

Like the handout the government take every paycheck.

Andrew yang really brings to light just how uneducated news anchor's, and fake fox journalists really are. They can't challenge him because they don't understand what he's talking about.

I'm right leaning, but this guy's gets it. Automation should solved.

I love andrew yang but wont 1000$ a month devalue the dollar and inflate prices i wanna be wrong but yeah.
#####
Andrew Yang stays laser focused on the real issues that Americans want to hear about.  He can't be swayed and he won't be swayed when he's president.  He's the best problem solver I've ever seen in my life and he will find a way to get the "Freedom Dividend" into our hands.  yang2020
#####
When you give people everything they lose the willingness to support themselves -  I have seen this first hand and I am not alone - Andrew - wake up and get an education.

i can finally respect this democrat since he respects other people's ideas unlike the other democrats its kinda rare to see a democrat who's not woke you know as a trump supporter i respect this man

Amazon creates a lot of jobs but a LOT of those are very short term. They work you until you physically can‚Äôt do it anymore. I started at a fullfilment center with a group of about 60. A little more than 6 months into it, I was one of the few left from that group. A year after I was hired my body just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve never been so physically broken from a job before. And I was active duty army for four years. Even now, over three years since leaving amazon, my body STILL hurts from that job. I would have been better off being homeless for that year because at least then I wouldn‚Äôt of had to break my body to survive.
#####
Great you identified the obvious problems. But didn‚Äôt offer a single solution. Tell us something we don‚Äôt already know. Duh.

I can see the new peasant class forming. Universal welfare, tiny houses, next to no ownership, thriving monopolies, dead zones. It's coming dummies.
#####
Who benefits from Amazon's efficiency?  Its customer.  People didn't like overpaying and getting poor service at the mall. Yang's VAT plan is a tax on Amazon's customers.

#####
Thank you!!!! The break up Facebook talk doesn't make any sense
#####
I agree. Elizabeth Warren is so 20th century. We need to move forward with Andrew Yang for the 21st century and beyond! I also don't agree with how that Facebook co-founder guy is calling to break up Facebook and has donated much to Elizabeth's campaign.
#####
I appreciate that you asked him legitimate questions to real problems.

Boycott Stephan Colbert TV show. He made fun of Andrew Yang for no reason why they want them in vest in their company.

I'm dying to see Yang on the debate stage.
#####
I‚Äôm trying to get my parents to let me go to the New York rally. Think I‚Äôm almost there! Andrew Yang 2020. Cant wait to meet the future president
#####
Yang has real solutions for the automation of jobs.
#####
Today's candidates simply do not understand the problems facing us today.  Andrew Yang sees the avalanche of tech coming down the mountain sweeping away jobs.  I hope we as Americans do not have a wait and see approach and get a bloody nose before we elect Andrew or someone else who understands what is happening.  This is a world wide phenomena also.
#####
The main stream media think Mr yang is too radical but he's not just talking. He got  solutions in writing which is  not any candidates in the running on both parties hav. Wake up America
#####
This candidate for president is sharper than a tack.  I would definitely vote for him but most Americans are too dumb to vote for him.  However, Yang would be an excellent choice for Secretary of Labor in any administration-DEM or GOP.
#####
Will a longform interview be published?
#####
YANG2020
#####
Utility and reliance. 

We keep going back to the big ones because they were the ones to leave the most initial impression in our minds so we keep going back to them. So long as our first instinct is to keep going back to them whenever we have a need that needed to be solved through their utilities, we will keep empowering them and they will continue to thrive. Our need is the foundation for their power. Elizabeth Warren's solution is not the answer- even if you fatally break them apart, all that means is that one day another who imitates what they do will rise to that position of power again. 

I would argue that they need more competition to FORCE them to be better and to be more transparent and to not be complacent, but an outright penalty is not the solution.
#####
Fantastic interview!
#####
Make America China Again !!
#####
Geek Wire - thanks for posting this. I've never really been into politics but Andrew Yang is the candidate we need, he is intelligent and has worked on detailed solutions for many of the major problems our country will face over the next decade. I see the momentum he is gaining and I think he will go all the way.
#####
He actually thinks before he speaks.

Andrew buddy when you are giving an interview please don't chuckle too often
when it is not relevant. It appears and sounds weird buddy. :)

Yang Gang 2020
#####
Andrew Yang is awesome! I have been disappointed in many of the "progressive" proposals by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately they show their age in promoting last century ideas that may sound good in the political arena but just do not get to the heart of our problems. Sounds great to stick it to "rich" people, but super problematic to implement and just causes division. Raising minimum wage or guaranteeing jobs will not benefit millions of stay at home parents or single moms in the way UBI can.
#####
Trump supporter here, and it's pretty fucking refreshing hearing this guy talk instead of the other race/sex-obsessed Democrats. I have lots of respect for this guy, honestly, and if I weren't voting for Trump, I'd definitely vote for him. One thing I do disagree with him on a major level, is (if you saw his interview with Ben Shapiro) that one of his policies actually declares that he has plans to "somewhat" police the media and social media platforms. That just seems like a looming China incident waiting to happen. I don't want the government messing around with any social media platforms. As for the media, just let them sink themselves into a hole, no need for the government to get involved.

3:08 "Does forcing Facebook and Instagram to become separate companies solve the problem?" It doesn't solve the teenage-girl-addicted-to-her-phone problem, no. But that's not the problem everyone is concerned about. Back here in the real world, we're concerned about concentration of power. Concentration of power is all fine and good until the day it comes for you. On top of which, these apps should be competing against one another. Instead, Facebook just bought out its competitors. Stop straw-manning the argument, Andrew. F**k!!!
#####
2:20 "Consolidation in some cases makes sense, nobody wants to use the fourth best navigation app." Yeah, er.... we're not talking about navigation apps, Andrew. We're talking about:
1) How Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook are the same company
2) How Google and YouTube are the same company
3) How Apple has forbidden apps that fight iPhone addiction, and has forced app vendors to favor Safari over other web browsers
OK, care to tell me how any of the above serve the consumer's vital interests?
Cliff notes: please stop fucking around with this navigation app straw man (he uses it at every interview), getting f***ing tired of it!!! We want to know if you have the balls to go up against big tech or NOT.

Can anyone identify what canned drink that is?

Thanks for interviewing Andrew Yang! Great interview!

Warren just talks the talk. She doesn't know how to solve the problems--this is because she doesn't identify and analyze problems like Andrew Yang does

#####
Hello geek, will the full interview be uploaded?
#####
America needs Yang!
#####
A smart, stupid person. That's what I see
#####
Andrew Yang's UBI proposal is about giving people FREEDOM OF CHOICE, FREEDOM TO CHOOSE! I will take it anytime hands down! The money will go back into the communities as the bulk of it will be spent there. It will keep business going and with the extra $ I can start my own business. With automation, companies in the 21st century will hire less people. Amazon is a good example. THERE WILL BE LESS JOBS and MORE JOB LOSSES TO COME SOONER THAN YOU THINK!!! So please wake up and look around! America is going to need more businesses n startups if it is going to survive and compete in the 21st century n beyond.That is why Andrew is in the race for President! For those who aren't able to work or compete for the 21st century jobs, its a crutch u can stand on. NO CITIZEN of America should have to starve to be a human being or live without a decent shelter in AMERICA OF ALL COUNTRIES!
#####
America is a plutocratic society and everything that is happening now, in particular the media, is to protect that status quo! Its NOT a democracy based on meritocracy. The definition of a¬†plutocracy¬†is a political system where the wealthy govern. When the richest people have all of the power in a society and make all of the political decisions. AND THEY WILL PROTECT IT AT ALL COSTS! SO vote for Yang if you believe in democracy!
#####
Andrew Yang not only has a big heart, has a huge brain also.
#####

Let‚Äôs tax Amazon so that unemployment goes up. Nice job Yang.

Before you go gaga over Yang's $1000 a month, find out if by accepting it it cuts into or out your Social Security Benefits?

#####
Oh yes my first time ever voting !! Bernie sorry but he has my vote
#####
Free? Not! We've been investing in this system for decades. What did they do? They keep bailing out their donors and lobbyists with all our money. We want the bag back, with interests.

It‚Äôs time for white america to have an Asian president.

Typical liberal mentality. Buy your votes....90% of people will piss that money away the minute they get it. Most people are broke because of themselves.....

Andrew Yang winning is easy as a Democrat.  Use the word FREE as FREELY and often as you can.  As a FREE American granted FREEdom offering FREE money, FREE healthcare, FREE College, FREE childcare, FREE housing, FREE cell phones, FREE reparations for blacks, FREE food, FREE money for mortgage, FREE, FREE FREE.......
#####
Seriously why arent more politicians fighting automations. They kill more jobs than immigrants and outsourcing can hope to do.
#####
That was a huge turnout! Good job Seattle!
#####
The founding fathers made it simple to run for President because they wanted it open to all natural born Americans not just the rich elites. No income requirement. No educational requirement. No political experience required. No foreign policy experience needed to run for President. I wish they made it all US citizens not just natural born citizens but I understand why they did that at that time. America was a new republic and was afraid of foreign influence. Now it is so much different so that fear doesn't' apply anymore. Congress should change it now as that requirement is well overdue for a change and rewrite. .Of course congress doesn't want to change it because their rich family dynasty could be challenged by anybody who becomes a citizen of this country. They can't have that now can they. Many immigrants are way more qualified than American born citizens. Imagine if Yang was born in Taiwan for even two weeks before he arrived in the US. That would make him unqualified and we would have lost a great candidate. Luckily his parents meet while attending Berkeley University and he was born in Schenectady New York. But it could have easily been a different story and there would be no Yang Gang to challenge Trump. Trump, Sarah Palin, and Chris Christie being some of the examples.
#####
Wow!

#YangGang
#####
Bernie Con-Artist sanders will not win the nomination without a catheter!
 To win,  liberals should offer FREE  oral sex besides everything else.
#####
Trump was an unlikely winner and he was a businessman and CEO. Andrew Yang has even better credentials and he can absolutely win. He is the only choice to logic his way through Congress and make a real difference for us and the next generation.
#####
reality check for the long duck dong gang. the economy is better than it has ever been in years. the democrats are out to destroy it with their socialist ideas.
#####
He is the only one that makes sense. Other candidates seem to focus on old problems and solution that does not apply any more. I liked Bernie and thought he should have been a president. But as we are in 2019 things have changed since 2016 and we are facing different problems that need to be addressed quickly other wise we will be facing catastrophic future.

An extra 1000 a month would do amazing things for most people.   We are the stakeholders of this great nation, we deserve a dividend from our country.

A worse communist than Bernie

Yang should have announced as an independent.  No way the democrat machine is going to let him in.

Wow...amazing...AY campaign is picking up steam. From here,  its just going to get bigger.  We need a leader that fight for the interest of the American people.
Voting for AY is voting for yourself. Voting for anyone else is voting AGAINST yourself.

HUMANITY FIRST.
#####
I definetly support and would vote for Andrew Yang. We need Universal Basic Income as the rich and poor gap gets bigger and bigger.
#####
Andrew I am not buying Amazon and saving $ to your campaign.  We need the UBI because tech is eliminating people jobs and the 12k a year can help.  Go Andrew Go.  I am covering both grounds: Yang in dem and Weld in republican.  But Yang is my choice for President.
#####
Let's go YangGang!!!!
#####
No business large or small is responsible for creating a single job. Hiring is the path of last resort in a capitalist economy. Ask any businessman or woman. The only time they hire anyone is if they cannot keep up with the demand for their goods or services. They do not create that demand. We do. THe consumers. People with money in their jeans. Our entire economic philosophy has been upside down for 40 years. Ive been yelling about it since I got out of economics classes.
#####
He's an internet juggernaut & yet still sitting at 1-3% & Biden is mid 30's%....Something doesn't smell right with these polls even if you factor in Biden's name recognition. Joe ain't getting millions of views on online interviews.
#####
Andrew Yang is the candidate to  take us into the ai revolution.  Thanks King 5 for the story!
#####
I wonder what the korean war vet down the street who saw his friends die by Chinese in the Chozion resovior feel when an a chinese man takes over

Awesome #YangGang powering #AndrewYang to white house, 1000$ a month for life, no questions asked, #SecureTheBag with #UBI

If anyones got any interest in Yang be sure to drop a dollar donation on his site, the more people that donate the louder his voice will be heard. People will have to wake up to the issues we need solutions to.

Stop replying to YouTube trolls.. Are you really going to change your mind on your vote because someone on YouTube pulled facts out of their butt? #YangGang #Yang2020 #RussianBots

Yang was in LA and no news media had an one on one interview with him because the LA media is part of the top 10 %. They don't want Yang to win because Yang will help the bottom 90 %.
#####
Our next POTUS & the only one I‚Äôd be proud to have.
#####
Another socialist trying to manufacture new "rights." True human rights are things we posses already and can only be taken away or suppressed such as the right to free speech. UBI is simply income redistribution by another name, and most of us would pay in way more than we ever get back. If you really believe we should all have 1000 dollars a month, why not just cut taxes by that much, cut out the middle man? But there's the rub. The government can only control the money if they collect it first.
#####
0:15 um...
#####
Our next President!!!! Andrew Yang! This guy is going to change the world!!!! I believe in this guy, he understands the 4th Industrial Revolution. Yuval Noah Harari talks about this and Kai-Fu Li explains it in his book China -AI Super Powers. Yang is the only one who gets it and will move us forward!!!
#####
I wanna fuck Yang in his Pootang.
#####
Yang inspires me to believe in America again
#####
I had a vision - Donald Trump will shock everyone by embracing Yang's UBI....most people greatly underestimate Trump
#####
I like Universal Welfare because it will incentivizethe people recieving social welfare to work again. Our system only delves in black and white; you either work or you recieve government benefits (you must be jobless to recieve SSI benifits). The second problem is, someone who is working a minimum wage job shouldn't be forced to make less than someone on social security who is the same age. Yes, that is only if the person on minimum wage is working about 45 hrs a every two weeks in Ca, but, because businesses don't want to give full time benefits, people rarely can take on enough hours to surpass someone on disabilities for "mental health" reasons who takes in about 900$ a month. Both equate to lifestyles of being broke because either are unlivable. Where we get the money is my concern, I'm all for consolidating programs, but I think we should ultimately address the reason our economy is skewed to begin with. We allow the rich to evade taxes through loopholes, we tax them considerbaly less in proportion to earnings. Inflation is what happens when the collective currency isn't being "trickled" down but rather hoarded. This UW could redistribute the wealth if generated from the pockets of those whom have far too much for doing for less than the working class.
#####
Who cares if 1% gets 1k/month if the rest of us 99% gets it?!  DO THE MATH!  Don't ruin this for the 99% who desperately needs UBI per month till death!  Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.

He's smart, well spoken, answered tough questions with direct and precise answers with pertinent knowledge and well thought out ideas... very presidential material.
#####
If Yang wins, again The US will be an example to follow to The world (Like in the 50's). Because europeans make fun of you (you have No idea how.many times I have heard how currently The world make fun of americans)

Yes. . Andrew Yang for 2020 President

retail is the biggest employer .   WOW , that proves to all you capitalist assholes that money makes people work to PRODUCE NOTHING .  it also proves that in a resource based economy we would not need to work more than TEN HOURS A WEEK .

this guy will never be president because he won't survive the car accident the CIA are planning for him .

"Your country loves you and values you." Yang

This is so stupid.  Neo Nazis and white supremacists want to get behind an Asian American Presidential candidate and you ask Andrew what he should do?  He didn‚Äôt ask these scumbags to support him.  This is so dumb.
#####
Neither NYT nor DNC realizes Yang is in 4th, FOURTH, place at PredictIt.org  according to the smart money betting website run by Wellington University.
#####
People in Houston loves Yang including Asian (not only Chinese America), can't wait to watch his debate. I watched most of the Asian news coverage too-It's interesting to find out Yang not only reunite American he reunite Asian too! But the main point I am making is he won't be bias, he will support all the people(not only some groups in their interest only) in United States of America, Yang is a very open minded, generous, fare and honest person.
#####
Andrew Yang is the best of the best of the best, let make him our President.
#####
The people who have a lot more,  have  a bulk of their $$$ kept off shore. Why should someone who is earning $100K+/year deserve another 12K on top of that. Is this money taxable?

It is a good idea if America can afford it. But unfortunately, there is no way America can come out with that kind of money. Please get real.

We need the robots to work for all of us instead of a privileged few and hope money trickles down to us.¬†Our economy needs to trickle up. We've invested billions in tech companies and it's time to get a return in our investment in the form of the Freedom Dividend because it lets us to decide what to do with our money.  The future isn't theirs. It's ours, if we want to take it.
#####
yeah...it only human say the world human language = 1,2,3,4.„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇthat make human understand!!!!! the world without races!!!just culture!!!!

Yang freedom dividend is no starter for most of the seniors. With the average SSI payment of $1,419 a month, if senior elects to take "freedom dividend" his social security payment will be reduced by $1,000. 62 Million Americans are collecting social security in 2019.
#####
This dude literally cuts thru all the bullshit. It‚Äôs so clear when he explains his shit. Nice
#####
With Yang Wang everybody would be peasants waiting on government to control a bit more of your life.
#####
smartest guy in the room
Do not vote for the politicians who ignored him, forcing him to run opposite them.
Do not trust anyone to execute his plan.  He is the smartest guy in the room, and technology companies will be happy to take a call from him - which is important to our future.  I switched parties for him.
#####
Got my vote
#####
I am not a fan of the MSM. They offer no substantial analysis but regurgitate the same questions. I like Yang as he speaks directly to the needs of people rather than what comes out of the the silos these ‚Äújournalist‚Äù  exist. Go Yang 2020!!!!
#####
Taking someone else's money because you're too f**king lazy to work isn't a universal right! lol
#####
I don't get why people think more money in the hands on consumers = more inflation. Most ideas of economic inflation is when money is printed. The Federal Reserve isn't going to print more money for adding UBI, unless we are actually running out of cash (assuming we aren't getting UBI as credit)
The other "inflation" isn't really inflation but more supply/demand of goods. Since consumers will have more buying power, supply will drop and demand will increase, increasing the prices as UBI continues. And as with all market projections, the new balance will be somewhere higher than what it is today. Just won't be doubled or tripled. Also you have to look at the potential small businesses rising with increased consumer buying power. In turn means competition. In turn means more supply, fulfilling demands.

That's just the basic assumptions of macroeconomy. Not many real life factors at play in that scenario. VAT is already assumed above, it should play out the same with increased costs due to supply/demand shifts. Of course you can imagine that idea with different possible factors to see where the economy will go. The only thing that would make me against UBI, is if it crashes the market and takes us into a depression.
It won't.

Or you know.. bernie's socialist economy policy which would help solve the income inequality... would help everyone except the 5% or below.
Or Trump's tax cuts for big businesses and trade war with China. Because that certainly helped America's bottom line. The farmers. (It didn't)
#####
Yang is the competent solution! Intelligent choice!
#####
that asian moron just said he would pay for a $3 trillion program with $800 billion and that he plans to cut welfare.
which would be devastating for millions of people who are dependent on welfare. plus with a value added tax the cost of products and services would sky rocket. in scandinavia they have a value added tax of 25% and it cost people $300 just for a shirt!
#####
He will unite the country and get the job done. All he wants to do is work. No bluster, no BS. Im and independent and Yang has my vote.
#####
He needs to show some personality leadership charisma and some attitude during the debate.
#####
The question was:
Why should people better off like us get 1k/mo

Simple answer, Yang says and treats every Americans equally...because if he excludes the upper middle...they will have a fit, saying why should I work hard and lower classes gets handout!

But upper middle class and upper class ...opt out and not need to signup for the 1k/mo they have morals and soul! 

* or they can pay-it-forward to less fortunate deserving families
#####
We need Andrew now!
#####
Robots don't buy stuff! As more and more jobs are automated away the consumer base shrinks. UBI is a plan that addresses this inherent contradiction. As well as all the other benefits it offers to society.
#####
He‚Äôs all about solutions. No politics, no bullshit, no throwing rocks, only solutions
#####
Hot  air  and  horse poop.     Millionaires  need  that $ 1000  per  month.      LOL

It's a scam to bribe lazy people to vote for him. So if everybody gets free money in Alaska, why isn't everybody moving to Alaska? These lazy people are just going to waste the 1,000 dollars. Amazon and Apple have powerful lobbyist that will bribe these senators to vote in their favor.

Keep your money Mr. Yang. Ill work for mine like most Americans. Thanks.
#####
Let's go Yang...
#####
Yeah sure, the alt right is for socialism
#####
Americans are not as helpless as Yang and the Democrats would have them believe.

Yang tells the citizens of America that the reason why the shops on their main street are closing is because of the big bad Amazon.

Many actually agree with him.

Dont any of them realize that they are the reason for the shops going out of business?

They placed the orders with Amazon from the comfort of their own homes rather than drive down town and spend their money in the local economy.

They are the main reason that the shops closed and now their children have no place to work over the summer.

There is no one to blame but the citizenry of the United States.

Stop shopping on Amazon or at Walmart and eventually the local shops will return and with them the jobs and the economic prosperity of the community.

Or. Americans can just embrace their victimhood and let the government take care of them.

Demoncrats do love victims.
#####
The Andrew Yang unofficial but highly appropriate campaign song.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yRDOrCFIY4c
#####
I believe everyone agree with his idea. However., he sounds just like the lying Obama- Who made empty promises. That is, lets be reasonable here.  Where and how is he going to get the money and when? 100 maybe 200 years from now?  What makes he think he can get the money from others and give it US?  It is easy to say than done. Just look at the pathetic Fking liar Obama failing plans. It smells more like fantasy then reality.
#####
The man has disavowed the support. Unfortunately, White Supremacist are struggling also in this country and Andrew Yang‚Äôs policies makes sense to them as it does to most Americans. UBI will help the poorest of the poor by putting better spending power in the middle class, who are holding on to the middle by a thread..Increasing the spending in the middle WILL create more jobs, which in turn, helps the bottom...and the top.
#####
it should start from birth
#####
i am chinese, andrew yang will be so much trouble for china compared to trump... but i really like  him.... what he represents, america is fortunate to have a patriot like andrew.... he came out because he knows shit has hit the fans.... and will continue to hit.  he push his ideas not himself... and he support everything he says with facts....
#####
He speaks like Nick cage
#####
REMEMBER TO REGISTER DEMOCRAT TO VOTE FOR YANG IN THE PRIMARIES
arguably more important than the last election against trump
#####
Yang is a serious contender...Keep laughing George, as you did before Trump got elected.
#####
Anyone but TRUMP!
I LOVE BERNIE ......he has heart.....
If Yang is gaining  ground, I'll definitely support him!
#####
could some1 explain how exactly is a VAT taxing Amazon? ü§îü§îü§î I'm so confused that I can't find any info from the vids of Andrew Yang and no one asks abt this. Am I understanding the VAT wrong? VAT is a tax that tax the end consumers, isn't it? It doesn't tax businesses, so how is it taxing Amazon? ü§®
#####
"We have to solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected"

The cost of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is often misunderstood and greatly exaggerated.  A simple, "back-of-the-envelope" estimate of the net cost of a UBI set at about the official poverty line: $12,000 per adult and $6,000 per child with a 50% "marginal tax rate" is $539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about $3.415 trillion. The net cost of this UBI scheme is less than 25% of the cost of current U.S.  entitlement spending, less than 15% of overall federal spending, and about 2.95% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The average net beneficiary is a family of about two people making about $27,000 per year in market income. The family's net benefit from the UBI would be nearly $9,000, raising their income to almost $36,000 (Widerquist).

I like Andrew Yang but he is completely  wrong about 16 year old vote. Between 16-21 all we want sex booze party music. And he knows it. But without 16 y.o. democratic party will not win in 2020.
#####
I can't believe he actually somewhat convinced me on allowing 16 year olds to vote. It was the high school debate portion.
#####
Andrew Yang  sounds very educated and is good at amking cohesive arguments that encourage converstion. He also has nice sense of humor
#####
LOL..My 9 year old grandson just told me he wants  Yang's Math hat :)
#####
I came here to see his math hat ...
#####
the opposite of donald trump is not an asian that likes math. it's a person with empathy that cares about the greater good and equality. race and math have nothing to do with it.
#####
i find the math hat cringe-y af and i'm asian. i HATE asian stereotypes includingi the whole 'asians are good at math' thing. i'm good at math cause i spent more time on math homework than my peers. not because i have some natural disposition to be good at it.

If only people who created their own jobs got one vote for every dollar in taxes they paid, we'd do great. If only invalids and preteens could vote, we'd all die as all the money gets spent on chocolate slides, space ships made out of cookies, unicorn breeding programs, and cloning pop stars.
#####
The only Democrat I would vote for
Yang 2020
#####
I can't believe he acknowledged yang gang
#####
8:46 there's an edit but I bet Yang went on to say things about the benefits of vocational school and how blue-collar jobs that are dissed are actually fine, so just in case there's some kids who are wicked smart out there just going to college because you think you 're supposed to: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. My friends and I are mostly college grads who regret the debt and aren't using our degrees.  Take a pause.  Learn life. Daily physical jobs that generate endorphins are a track to consider that doesn't begin with debt.  
Also obviously vote for Yang
#####
I'm not a guy.  So, you guys?

The system is rigged if you are not a minority you don't get the free goodies or saved seats

College needs a huge over haul. Students need practical experiences, not theoretical crap from textbooks that is being recycle years after years.

Unless your career requires a special permit or license that needs to be renew. And if your job isn‚Äôt automated already by computer that is faster and more accurate.
#####
There needs to be an edit at 1:35- Whether you're left, right, or FORWARD***
#####
6:47 LOL, people born in 2002 are babies, how can they vote?

Wait a minute...

I barely trust 16 year olds to drive...my nephew is about to turn 16, I promise, you don't want him voting on things that effect our country
#####
YES I WANNA VOTE - 16 year old.
#####
1) OMG, 16yo should vote. What life experience does a 16yo have? Why should some kid who has never supported himself or taken responsibility for anything, vote on my tax dollars? 2) Math.  1k/mo for 250M people =12000*250000000=3T tax/yr (if govt was 100% efficient) ---this is nearly double the current US federal budget and 3T is ~15% of US GDP.  3) Anyone with life wisdom knows most people work because they have to.
#####
Dude.... have you been to a highschool? Those kids should not be voting
#####
Andrew lowkey smart asf
#####
I like Andrew yang.  But his outlook on letting 16 year olds vote is way too optimistic.  Thinking highschool students will act like adults is unrealistic.   It's more likely they'll just fight about it
#####
I support being able to vote from age 16.  My teenagers know more political facts and state of the world than most adults.  Don't underestimate our young!  Give them the right to decide a leader that's gonna shape their future world.
#####
Andrew Yang discussing such issues Ben Shapiro might be quite effective in getting more of US voting.
#####
Andrew Yang is the only candidate that won't cost every American $1000/month.
#####
I support the 16 year old voting policy. Although i do look around and see many un educated, un informed kids, i do see many critical thinking  and informed kids, and like he said, this could open up discussion about politics in school which is good.
#####
Yang has my votes(primary and general election) and donations to his campaign. Go Yangsters!!
#####
Make America Think Harder!
Haha love it. I'm a Bernie guy through and through but I'd love it if Yang got an important place in the Bernie White House.
#####
I will be voting for Yang in the primaries.  Sensible, compassionate, and a surefire way to get Trump out of office.
#####
I turn 17 in september but I want to vote and im in georgia
#####
Huh? Our Super Tutor is interviewing my fav candidate?  Just turned 18 and I'm ready to vote!
#####
Andrew Yang is the real deal.  I'm a baby boomer, and I've never seen one of such intelligence as Yang.  He has my vote, and I hope more people will research him.  He's telling the truth.
#####
Wowww... That young age voting is just mind-blowingly good
#####
Thumbs up if you love math!
#####
Yang 2020!! Hard to not love this guy when you hear him speak
#####
i love andrew but here are my thoughts on 16 yo voting:
they will more often vote like their parents, give people with teenage children (later adults) more power, take away power from younger (well not younger than 16 but current range of youngest voters) and older voters
#####
Andrew Yang will make us the world leader again.
#####
live in canada and i donate to this guy, i believe he will be able to set a standard for the rest of the world to follow
#####
It's either Yang 2020 or no one at all!
#####
The only problem I could see with 16 yr olds voting, is that parents have such a influence on their children, the 16 year old demographic would mostly mirror the values of their parents.
#####
Wow he actually makes a lot of sense
#####
#best candidate ever!
#####
I'm a Tulsi Gabbard supporter, but I still donate Yang's campaign because he's a problem solver.
#####
I have no problem with lowering the voting age down 16 because I come across a lot of Young Americans under age of 25 who are more politically oriented  than your typical older American.
#####
16 year olds should not vote. Plain and simple. Impulsive.
#####
I don‚Äôt agree that 16 years old should vote.  They are not matured enough to know how real life works.
#####
As a 15 year old, 16 year olds voting sounds like a horrible idea. Even though most voters don‚Äôt pay attention to the candidates they vote for, it doesn‚Äôt give any excuse to allow people who are even less informed to vote. The amount of 16 year old people still saying ‚ÄúDrumpf bad‚Äù without any evidence is astounding
#####
Newspapers are geared for an 8th grade reading level. Of course 16 year old should be able to vote. If a 60 year old who gets all her news from the newspaper can vote a person still in school can vote.
#####
As a lifelong non-voter I'm voting for the first time and I'm #yanggang baby
#####
I know a lot of kids less than 14 who are way more qualified to vote than most adults.
#####
Not really in favor of 16yr old's voting. The idea that they're mature enough to decide who gets to completely shape this nation for 4 years and has the power to launch nuclear strikes, but they're not mature enough to drink a beer, is illogical.
#####
He‚Äôs putting the trust into the American People which leader has done such thing, Andrew Yang is to power the people
#####
Those 44% take idiotic subjects that will never get a job. Get rid of idiotic subjects. Start in the first grade teaching common sense, responsibility, budgeting, and How to support themselves.
#####
Get rid of degrees that you cant get a job in. Make colleges more streamlined ,not a daycare for 18 year olds. Open vocational schools for individuals . I will never vote for anyone who want 16 year olds to vote.
Why dont we let 16 year olds drive?
#####
I didn't think 16 year olds should vote due to lack of experience but after listening to him speak 3-4 lines and explain his reasoning, I'm now 100% on board. It would be great for kids to be more politically active, especially in school. They can have politics class. That's probably what not only USA needs, but the world. It's obvious rich adults don't care about climate change, they got theirs already and will be dead, who cares about the kids! Is what most think even if they won't admit it.
#####
I really like how Andrew yang is making time to be a guest on so many different YouTube channels
#####
Andrew Yang is the hot new thing for young people. Bernie is so 2016..
#####
Where can I get that hat?
#####
YANG 2020 / FREEDOM DIVIDEND       I'm a Boomer.  I donated. MSNBC was RUDE to YANG.  Telemundo guy didn't understand VAT.  Mic was turned off.    Spread the word about FREEDOM DIVIDEND !!!
#####
16 year olds should not vote. 18 years olds barely can efficiently. Remember America is the richest yet the most uneducated first world country. I don't need 16 year olds doing so as well. Hell they can barely drive.
#####
He's very convincing in theory but how would this play out practically which is the flaw in the lefts ideology
#####
Yang reminds me of kermit the frog!!! Imagine him green and the voice is the same!!! I like him!! Lol
#####
This is surreal, I used to watch this channel during the college application season but now it‚Äôs for #yanggang
#####
*before watching video*

me: hmmm i think i‚Äôll strongly disagree with andrew on this one.. i guess we have one thing not aligned then

*5 minutes into the video*

me: yes i think that 16 years old should be eligible enough to vote and they‚Äôre not too young tbh

DAMN IT ANDREW ALWAYS CORRECTING ME WITH FACTS AND DATA
#####
'm a Libertarian who is throwing my hat in the Yang ring. I will give this advice to all Yang Gangers..If you should encounter a crusty old conservative who wants to shout you down about Yang is a communist or his idea won't work..Be sure to mention that free market economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman both supported the UBI idea. Friedman called it a "negative tax"..But it would serve you well to understand both's argument's for UBI and have that info at the ready should  one try to debate you on it.
#####
Like if you‚Äôre in the #YangGang
#####
Yang's view on education and the job market is excellent.  Great questions and equal great answers.
#####
I like Yang, but I don‚Äôt agree with his position on 16/17 yo being able to vote. 18 is already a young age and I‚Äôm not sure what difference two years is going to change.

Yang wants to give you money but will the rest of the elected let that happen? Same as the Sanders conundrum. You think Sanders or Yang get elected and the next day you're getting a check? Those are campaign promises. And nobody keeps those.
#####
Math hatter !

He's really smart. I didn't make a connection between lower voting age and quality political discussions in school and society.

Awesome #YangGang powering #AndrewYang to white house, 1000$ a month for life, no questions asked, #SecureTheBag? with #UBI #FreedomDividend #LetYangSpeak
#####
This guy is a snake oil salesman and a SOCIALIST!!! Don't fall for it America!
#####
He has my vote.
#####
Yang's first book "Smart people should build things" is excellent.
#####
Also having more young people voting means we can counterbalance the amount of old people voting. That's millions more voting
#####
Soooo school an college is a scam. Because  the word reparation wasnt taught to many students... and historic events.. havnt all the way true.... we just obtained 10 percent  of the real history.  While academic scholars  get that information...

Where did that last guy get his info on UBI that we had try before and didn't work? He need to look at Alaska. Alaskan have it for almost 40 years now and still have it.
#####
That guy at 2:20.  Hey dimwit.  You forgot Alaska
#####
What a joke that "economist" was. "UBI doesn't focus on poor people." Ok so let's not do anything to help the poor people. What kind of logic is that. Rich people already cry about welfare. at least freedom dividend makes sure they get paid too. And not by just tax dollars out of their pockets but with Yang's proposal it's the biggest earners like Amazon, Facebook, Google etc would be paying the chunk of the bill. That dumb "economist" probably hasn't heard even the tiniest bit of what Yang's actually proposing.
#####
This really seemed to misrepresent what yang is about. Go watch a speech or a podcast with him on it
#####
I call bull on that last guy who said it had been tried in the U.S. and failed. Actually Alaska still has one  and everyone loves it!
#####
Yang gang! Supporting Yang online isn‚Äôt enough‚Äî
1) Make sure you actually REGISTER as a Democrat by the deadline
2) CHECK YOUR STATE‚ÄôS primary date (which is different for each state) 
3) ACTUALLY VOTE!
#####
Lol UBI has been tested in parts of the states unsuccessfully? Where? If it was only a part and short duration, then it‚Äôs not universal. Who is this idiot near the end ?
#####
Whites with Yang!
#####
No more scumbags for president, in government or any public office! We are the people and we need to bring back ‚Äúby the people for the people‚Äù for our country! Yang2020!
#####
Yang2020!
#####
Asian, white, or whatever... I'm white but I support him because of his ideas, not because of his race. The race doesn't matter. Stats, facts, and a leader that will make the country better, no matter what gender or ethnicity, matters.
#####
Yang 2020
#####
I'm proud to be Chinese. But also proud to be an American. This country has given me opportunities and in turn created success for me. I would like to share and support others who have the same American dream. Go Yang
#####
I don't wanna sound "bad" , but with a "humanity 1st" statement, there's a lot of "Asian American" references not "human" ones.
#####
2:12 Ever heard of Alaska? Lol
#####
That turds opinion from the Heritage group you threw in there at the end was silly. It was just bluster with no facts to back it up. I guess nothing in this video had any back up but it's hard to do in a quick piece like this was.
#####
A vote for anyone else is minus $1000 in your pocket every month. The choice is easy. Don‚Äôt be dumb.
#####
I swear,, I‚Äôm not even American and I wish I could vote for him!!
#####
MELANIA TRUMP WILL VOTE FOR YANG SO DO I
#####
Yang seems to have a very very humongous abrain. I'll definitely consider him. He's really smart.
#####
I'll go for Yang or Buttigieg. Which ever is ahead.

When did America have a universal income just curious I didn‚Äôt know that. And was it like yang is suggesting.

"The Heritage Foundation" - lol, gtfo. "It doesn't focus the resources on those that need it most." _HE_ means rich people, lol.

Why include the clip of the right wing heritage foundation guy? He doesn't know what he's talking about. Something like UBI is working well in Alaska.

Then why is the oil dividend in alask been in effect for 30 years if it hasnt worked? I say its atleast a solution im voting yang
#####
Question... did I hear it right that Yang wasn't born in the US or did I hear wrong? Please correct me if I'm wrong but its my understanding that in order to be qualified for the highest elected position in the US, the candidate must be a natural born citizen... I support Mayor Pete byt...
#####
Andrew Yang is a well educated, smart, successful entrepreneur with a passion to make America REALLY great, across all lines of ethnicity, color,  and socio-economic status. Vijay Menon is an ACTOR...he reads line when he's paid, and he's very good at it - winning many awards for his parts in Indian (South west) films. I'm an American white guy, but I know enough about Asian culture to know that the Berkeley graduated, American born, son of  Taiwanese immigrants has a better handle on what's happening in the US than an actor from the back water of Kerala.
#####
"The reality is UBI does not focus resources on the people who need it most"... well that is a rich statement coming from the Heritage Foundation, LoL
#####
Harris is NOTHING what Yang is. She‚Äôs a black Hillary, end of story, she‚Äôs a crook and a crony of the Democratic establishment.

Fuck. Her.
#####
Andrew yang wants all Americans to be paid $1000 a month as basic income, that's $12000 a year,  there are 350,000,000 Americans, that adds up to 42 trillion dollars a year, do any of you see why this is a fucking stupid idea??
#####
I like Yang; and I really respect Asian American culture.
Hardworking, education-oriented people with the best food known to mankind.


Awesome Combo ;)
#####
I‚Äôm Asian American but a republican. Yet Yang truly seems like a smart candidate. Hope he goes far this election, we‚Äôll see

Yang's town hall will happen this Sunday, April 14th at 8 pm EST on CNN.  Please spread the word & tune in.   @

Oklahoman for yang
#####
Go Andrew!  We need more Asian American leaders like you.. it‚Äôs time for us to step up and involve in the American society
#####
That guy felt that he had to throw Kamala Harris' name in there with Andrew Yang, but not because she's a good choice for president
#####
Never, never will you lead my country. You are an UnAmerican JOKE. You'll allow babies to be killed during and after the 3rd trimester, you'll give our money to blacks that have nothing to do with the slavery of the past.  Hey if mail-in genetic background checks show someone is one 1000th black then do they get a cut too.  You'd give income to those who choose not to work. How about some more money to the Chinese who forefathers worked on the railroads. When would it end? You'd ban or over-regulate the guns that keep good Americans safe in spite of the 2nd amendment. You'd tax the Sh*t out of America and we will never never stand for that.  Nice try Yang.
#####
Smartest and best candidate running so far.

LOL YOUR CRITIQUE CAME FROM THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION! LOL LMAO. HAHHAHAHA HAAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHbababbababbananghahhahahha
#####
For all the Yang bots out there that have no idea how economics works need to understand inflation will destroy all of your lives under Yang's mindless UBI. 


I'm just going to start positing videos showing incredibly basic levels of economic theory because it seems like so many of you base all economics off what Yang says. Yang is trying to make money off you all by selling books, through donations and later to speaking events or whatever else he can do... reality is without a 1k bribe not one of you would be here. 


Inflation will crush you but it will take an amount of time, not long... probably inside of 6 months you will feel the effects heavily. Rent will go up, Housing prices will skyrocket as everyone buys and the amount of houses shrink insanely fast. Every business with a VAT tax will raise costs to cover it so YOU will be paying that tax within a short period of time. But you will in fact have a moment where you can splurge and buy a bunch of garbage, and you will...

Hey YangGang, congratulations, your guy did great on MSNBC today, I am Bernie/Tulsi/Yang and would be thrilled with any of them. Yang supports M4A which is my dealbreaker. No to Beto, Mayor Pete or the other fakes.

Universal basic income is the dumbest idea ever
#####
Asian americans vote democratic yet live as conservatives.

"Andrew Yang wants to give Americans $1000 a month, no questions asked." Andrew, are you sure you want to do that? With this action, you will create lots of lazy people!
#####
Vijay does not strike me as somebody who is in touch with the poor and disenfranchised in this country.... So he can take his opinion and..
 Andrew on the other hand worked for many years creating businesses and jobs in the poorest sections of our country. He actually set up a non-profit with $120,000 of his own money and $120,000 from 12 of his friends  to get this going... venture for American
#####
Bunch of real winners in these comments. We call them "LOSERS".
#####
Yang wants circumcision to be banned. Hmm,yep,exactly what the US needs. More Asians and more or less skin on the penis,lol! Bunch of idiots dont know what or who to vote for. "I like yang" No no you like WANG for yo ass not for president. Yall got no one else to vote for huh? Voting with your master's and followers I see. Seriously,this is the best you liberals got?
#####
yang and harris are alike? lol
#####
Ofcourse they squeeze a Heritage Foundation think tank sound bite in there..
#####
The only thing I like about this guys he wants to keep babies hole and not circumcised but other than that he sounds like another phony to me considering he‚Äôs only wanting to do the best for Asians and Taiwanese not the American people

#####
Yang's the one.....betos the millioniare narcisist that is so far removed from everyday Americans.
#####
2:07 *"It doesn't focus on those who need it most."*

I disagree for many reasons:

1. Nobody falls through the cracks. In Louisiana (2016), for example, 4 families statewide received cash assistance for every 100 families in poverty. That's 96% of families in poverty that are not receiving assistance. Under Yang's plan, everyone receives the $1000 a month.
2. You don't lose it if your circumstances change. If you get a job and start receiving an income, your benefits won't be taken away. No reporting, no hassle, and if you work more you don't gain less, trapping you in a cycle of poverty.
3. It's opt in. Under Andrew Yang's plan, if you're receiving more in benefits now, you could choose that instead of the "Freedom Dividend." Although I have a feeling people will like this more.
4. This monthly income can be invested freely in whatever the individual chooses. Whether that's education, starting a business, family, or investing back into the local economy (which may even create more jobs).
5. There's no stigma because everyone receives the $1000 a month.
#####
I love how he is for the people, he doesn't race-bait, he actually backs up his policy ideas with stats, and details on how to put for action, he does not bash Trump or Obama in a child-like manor, and he's intelligent. He needs to be president.
#####
‚ÄúEconomist‚Äù from Heritage Foundation = paid ‚Äúconservative‚Äù puppets.
#####
put all the money back into the stock market.
#####
Asian is not even on the table, its the exact opposite, Andrew is against identity politics. Also look carefully at why he advocates UBI. Democrats current core is defined as the women's/anti-male party. Yet Yang is directly addressing a fundamental problems that are politically impossible for Dems to address. Andrew Yang fits in the category of fist principled thinker, See Eric Weinstein's Four Quadrant Model as the typical labels simply do not work here. UBI may or may not not be the right answer. One issue I see is UBI's one size fits all. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0BEMOrkR2I

#####
This guy has to be on Bill Maher's show
#####
So this Vijay guy says that the UBI doesn't focus the resources on those who need it most... how? If in fact the $1000/month is non-taxable as Andrew Yang explained, then wouldn't it help those in need of a cushion to pay their bills and even have spending money to boost the local economy and not just serve the Amazons of the world?
#####
*_PLEASE_** help us spread Andrew Yang‚Äôs name! We need him in the White House in 2020!!!*

Share Yang's videos on forums, with your friends and family share with everyone. People will come to their senses and realize how great he is, and that they're also tired of fake politicians with no regard for the people.
#####
I really like this candidate. It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôll never receive enough recognition to win.
#####
Yang has certainly become more comfortable in the more recent debates. He is a quick study.
#####
China is #1 threat. In 50-100 years time if something isn't done, they will be too close to becoming the new world hegemon.

Yang sounds like he knows what he‚Äôs doing.

if you guys want change, vote for this guy, put him in office !

vote for him


donate too

first black, then Orange, Now Yellow?

Is that all the time this guy got lmaol
#####
So what‚Äôs is the right way to crack down on China?  And the Russia hacking was going on well before President Trump took office.  

I like this guy though and I think he would be the only one in the panel that could give President Trump a run for the money.
#####
This man is possibly one of the dumbest people to ever run for president. First off Russia didn't hack our democracy, that has been proven... Secondly how would he know if they are laughing their asses off, does he hang out with "them"... the "bad guys" over there, hidden.. somewhere in the shadows? 


Basically Yang managed to do as he always does, talks but says nothing. I'd just like to point out that the US hacks others elections, we put puppet Governments in... and Yang feels Russia is bad because... Trump. 


Yang, I feel you are a danger because you outright bribe people to vote for you with the UBI.
#####
This is false Russia is not hacking anything
#####
Yang is wrong about Russia. We've been getting hacked by our own intelligence agencies. They've been brainwashing  the public through mainstream media and censorship of independent media. Yang here proves he's just another puppet.
#####
Light on China .....wonder why ?

It's easier for democrats to blame Russia than to admit they bet on a terrible candidate. Hillary outspent Trump, had the whole liberal media in her back pocket and was given debate questions ahead of time and STILL lost. Donors won't give these idiots money if they find out candidates are incompetent, so just blame Russia.
#####
The only dem who has a chance against Agent-Orange
#####
Once you've heard Andrew Yang speak, the rest of the candidates sound like Charlie Brown's teacher...
#####
We need a real man in the White House, not a Russian puppet with small hands.
#####
Bravo Sierra. China = infanticide and organ theft . they have the largest on the ground network of spies. They accuse any who catch them of being racist. As we ignore that too
#####
I stand with Yang and will vote for him
#####
Why Democrats hate Russia?
#####
Honestly I think America is laughoing stalk of the world and will be a cold day in hell before I pay a penny in income tax within the fascist states. What a joke!
#####
What an absolute boss.
#####
They let this man speak only two times the entire debate.
#####
YANG GANG TO BANG YOUR ASSES
#####
He‚Äôs the smartest Person I‚Äôve ever seen running for President
#####
The only Democrat I‚Äôm voting for is yang
#####
when you say hacked our election...what do you mean by that?
#####
We all know China is the biggest threat.  Trust him to avoid saying that......
#####
I like Yang, but this excerpt is strange. I previously heard Yang say that the Dems need to stop blaming Russia and see how it's the automation of American jobs that are the biggest challenge. Here, he just sounds like the rest of the Dems.
#####
Politicians answer: look we‚Äôve got to come together as a nation and show the world we‚Äôre a leader of democracy.
#####
He needs to slow down
#####
You Democrats are blind China is the worst Russia is second. That's why  i'll vote for Trump  this election.
#####
I agree they‚Äôre laughing their asses off. At the Democrats.
#####
Mitt Romney said it first, and the Democrats laughed at him.
#####
I really like Andrew Yang. He's intelligent and has quite some good points that I buy (and Asian). But honestly, he is way too nice to beat Trump in a debate. He'd be Jeb 2.0 in 2020...
#####
NBC I blame you for this blatant disrespect against Andrew Yang.
#####
the charisma of a wet rag, one dumb idea and copying everything else from bernie

that's a winning ticket right there
#####
Maybe it's the algorithm, but when I look at the comments, everyone is saying positive things about Andrew Yang, and that shit doesn't happen.  This guy may have more policy proposals than everyone else on that stage combined, and most of them are really good practical solutions.  I've gotta wonder if a guy proposing radical changes to how our economy works might actually have a chance.
#####
Love Andrew Yang. So down to earth and intelligent ü§ì
#####
Yang probably most sensible dem on there yet he is a dem and he isn‚Äôt part of the establishment
#####
Trade war punish business leader. Yeah right! They sold off American jobs to the lowest bidder padding their greedy pockets, they created the trade imbalance. They get what they deserve!
#####
yang dang sweet putang trump 2020 !
#####
Putin is laughing at the democrats, for sure.
#####
If this is who the democrats are running they might as well just get on their knees and hands trump the presidency.   What was even the point of all that? To see who could virtue signal the hardest and give away as much free crap as possible while making Americans foot the bill?
#####
lol !! Does Yang believe in Rassiagate or he just repeats mainstream bullshit talking point?
#####
It‚Äôs gonna be Yang, Tulsi or Bernie for me. It was a disservice to cut Yang‚Äôs mic and I do not respect the establishment that condones this.
#####
lol at the paid shills in the audience clutching their pearls when Yang says ass
#####
I support this man 100%
#####
I swear to god if the dems and nbc don‚Äôt give this man more talking time next debate and continue to ghost and sabotage him it‚Äôll be a travesty. If you watch Yangs videos he literally has 90+% of all Dems AND conservatives on his side in the comments. Obama couldn‚Äôt even unite people the way this man is doing. I just don‚Äôt get it, even from a pandering identity politics perspective Yang would seem like a Dems wet dream. An Asian son of immigrants who wants to give people 1k/month and has Obama-esque charisma along with substance and evidence driven policies? I have no idea why they aren‚Äôt pushing this man like they did Obama. Obama was just as unknown in the beginning and built his profile grassroots style but he wasn‚Äôt shut down by the Dems in power like Yang is being shut down. If the democrats are so bent on beating Trump Yang is their ONLY option. Yang would run circles around Trump in a debate and wouldn‚Äôt resort to calling him racist every 5 min. There is no other option, Yang 2020!
#####
Pete threw some shade at 'downplaying' China's threat, but Andy is right that Russia is a bigger threat and they're only going to get stronger as we near Election Day. Secure our elections, defend our rights as voting citizens of this country.
#####
Yes Russia is laughing at all the idiots that believed the big lie fake news propaganda of Russian collusion.
#####
All I heard what inarticulate scrambled jargon. I don't want a president who's nervous to even complete his sentences.
#####
Too late NBC!!!
#####
TURN THE MIC ON NEXT TIME PLEASE
#####
Him and tulsi are literally the only chance the democracts have and they already fucked that up.
#####
I wonder if Mr. Yang can explain why American's in silicon valley can't afford to rent a house? American's are now homeless
#####
Do explain, NBC of New York, why he got less than 3 minutes to speak...out of 2 hours?!!
#####
Even if Yang doesn't win, I'm glad he is doing all of this, bringing in some sense to this country, something which we are severely lacking. Maybe in the far future, when UBI does get implemented, we can all know that Yang was the first presidential president to bring it to the table.
#####
Russia hacking our democracy successfully ? where's the proof Mr Yang.. it seems like Mr Yang is the fake news.. still selling a baseless conspiracy theory.. as if it hasn't  been debunked Every Which Way but Wednesday ..
#####
Who needs Russia when folks at NBC are "laughing their asses off" for restricting Yang's airtime and subverting democracy.
Same stage. Same rules. Different mic volumes. üò©üé§üîá
#####
I need to vote for this guy....
#####
Andrew is a breath of fresh air. Very few will see greatness as it starts to rise. They will call it foolishness.
#####
ironic Mr. Yang -your hero Obama laughed off the republican candidates opine on the danger of Russia live in a debate. Now democrats see Russia as the great satan again. Question is what will democrats think next year? They seem confused. Or does it really just depend on who is in the White House?
#####
God damnit why can't we have YouTube host a debate so everyone gets a fair share of air time instead of allowing NBC to shortchange Yang like this?
#####
Notice the difference America when Yang speaks. He thinks about his words and is focused on tangible things. He cites data, names names in respectful ways and addresses the point without a song and dance. He doesn't wander off course and make things personal. He doesn't speak with outrage. He speaks like a normal educated man. Fight for Yang and get him elected.
#####
What does he know about our intel on foreign governments? The same garbage we read on the Internet that isn't proven.
#####
Biden: *13:19* minutes.
Harris: *12:16* minutes.
Buttigieg: *11:21* minutes.

*_Yang: _**_2:58_**_ minutes_* ... NBC have *INTENTIONALLY* muted *_Andrew Yang_* . Disgusting.
#####
Yang is a chineese spy!
#####
Word of advice for Mr. Yang: Since playing the race card worked so well for Kamala Harris, perhaps you should start claiming victimhood from the Chinese Exclusion Act?

'Hacking our democracy'... There is no hope for the USA
#####
Asian man doesn't quite meet the Democratic Party's and NBC's priorities of the diversity pecking order right now.  Sorry, black and female is in, not Asian and male.  You just need to scream RACISM every few minutes then scared white liberals will be forced to notice you.
#####
Oh yea tarriffs are wrong way to go.. because our past actions worked so well.
#####
What this Asian talking about
American president is for white people
#####
This man is REAL!
#####
Andrew Yang was robbed.
#####
Even the video finished with someone interrupting.
#####
I'm sure he was nervous, imagine being on the debate stage with Biden, Sanders, and those governors and congressmen, having most people not know who you are, and having to present an idea in 45 seconds that initially sounds pretty crazy. 


Yang qualifies for the July and September debates, so now that he knows what to expect, I'm sure he'll perform better.
#####
Even though I don't believe Trump colluded with the Russians, his win in the 2016 elections was an even better outcome than they expected. It seems they wanted to sow discord in the American populace and they achieved that goal tenfold.
#####
Yang has my vote. He is REAL. He is 100% HUMAN. Not like the rest of these NPC robots
#####
Wow,¬† they will take away your present health insurance,¬† give everyone a standard government version and the working/middle class is going to pay for this plus all of the non citizens and their families as well?¬†¬† Yikes!!¬†¬† Screw the middle class but good,¬† y'all!¬† The only people who worked with Russia were Obama and Hillary.
#####
Yank is as much a Jackass as the rest of the Satanists on stage.
#####
Dems seems strange
#####
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll win, but this guy is super smart. Everything he says is spot on.
#####
Yang's $1000 a month promise would require roughly $3.6 Trillion dollars every 
year. If Yang was elected, that becomes $14.4 Trillion dollars in one Yang 
term of office. The current US National Debt is estimated to be around 
$22 Trillion USD.

  How can Yang supporters be so diluted to think that expanding both the national debt and the dependence of American citizens on government assistance is going to help our situation in this country?
#####
YANG GANG
#####
Yang is for real, the more you hear the more he draws you in.
#####
God Save The Tsar!
#####
ARE WE THE AMERICAN VOTER SO stupid to let these 25 idiot democrats to  enslave us to work  hard and pay heavy taxes so these idiot spoiled democrats   GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE FOR 11 MILLION ILLEGALS WHO broke our laws and disrespect our country.??ARE WE SO STUPID TO VOTE FOR THESE HEARTLESS AND MINDLESS FANATICS????
#####
He really just said all that in 1 minute
#####
His exact words were "My campaign will give every adult $1,000 per year".
It's been 6 month and I still haven't got my check from his campaign committee.
Can I sue him.
#####
America is a plutocratic society and everything that is happening now, in particular the media, is to protect that status quo! Its NOT a democracy based on meritocracy. The definition of a¬†plutocracy¬†is a political system where the wealthy govern. When the richest people have all of the power in a society and make all of the political decisions. AND THEY WILL PROTECT IT AT ALL COSTS! SO vote for Yang if you believe in democracy!
#####
UBI is about giving people FREEDOM OF CHOICE, FREEDOM TO CHOOSE! I will take it anytime hands down! The money will go back into the communities as the bulk of it will be spent there. It will keep business going and with the extra $ I can start my own business. With automation, companies in the 21st century will hire less people. Amazon is a good example. THERE WILL BE LESS JOBS and MORE JOB LOSSES TO COME SOONER THAN YOU THINK!!! So please wake up and look around! America is going to need more businesses n startups if it is going to survive and compete in the 21st century n beyond.That is why Andrew is in the race for President! For those who aren't able to work or compete for the 21st century jobs, its a crutch u can stand on. NO CITIZEN of America should have to starve to be a human being or live without a decent shelter in AMERICA OF ALL COUNTRIES!
#####
His math is flawed. It amounts to about 4 trillion dollars a year. It would devalue our money by about 50% in five years. People on fixed incomes would starve and lose their homes.
#####
I don't understand what yang wants to do. So I rather vote for trump
#####
It's not about the money, it's about putting every American on the Government dole. Once they start "giving" everyone something, once everyone in the country is under the Government's thumb, then the Government will have the right to dictate everything you think, say and do. Bingo. Communism. Keep your $1000 Yang!
#####
I dont know who is more retarded. This dude or the people who believe him.
Heres how this would go:
Tax businesses higher
Businesses lay off more employees outsource and raise price of goods.
Price of goods is raised, people call for hugher minimum wage.
Minimum wage is raised
With the price of goods going up, equaling to the same hourly wage rate vs price of goods as it is now. You are nownin a different tax bracketm and are taxed more. Therefore u are actually moor poor than b4
#####
@:58 Joe Biden is so lost haha
#####
Good luck getting companies to pay more taxes why do you think they spend money on the best lawyers in the country to avoid taxes?
#####
Im 23 years old and unemployed and i have 0 skills and 1000 dollars a month could really help me get on my feet. Should i vote for him or not
#####
Yang is the real problem solver!
#####
I read that Young's 1000/mo. is only for adults up to 64. Why? The seniors are the ones who need this because most are on fixed income. What are we chopped liver?
#####
This is the first presidential candidate that I've actually given an interest in aside from Obama. I'm an unaffiliated voter. I am 22 years of age. 
I can remember 3 presidencies first hand: W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. 
The first resulted in war with non-sensical promises of the American dream
The second promised hope in the wake of economical turmoil and war
The third promised greatness and to return to the common man the ability to be proud in ones flag. 
In my eyes, no matter how much I love Obama, all three failed. 
"We are no greater than we were yesterday" I've been saying this with certainty since I was a child. 
Every politician gives these promises of hope and faith that we can one day return to what we used to be. 
When I think of what we used to be I think the roaring 20's, The War for Independence, World war 2, the entire Reagan administration. 

For once.. I genuinely believe a candidate has a solution. He's not the most charismatic. He's not the most outspoken. 
He's the one bringing facts and figures to the table. 
This man deserves to at least be put through for a while, I want to hear more of what he has to say and hear him talk about more of his own policies but for me.. for once.. a candidate is showing me a glimmer of hope. And that hope is tied to his intellect.
#####
Yang is the only candidate who is thinking about technology seriously. Technology is and has been said to be the next revolution, we must think ahead of the curve to win! #Yang2020
#####
Yang‚Äôs intelligence is 2x the average of his competitors
#####
Andrew Yang, one of the few democrats that's not a clown (the others being Tulsi, Bernie, and maybe Warren or Williamson). The others are clowns
#####
why 1000 pittance dollars? why not 5000 a month?
#####
Popular platform in 2020: Tell couch potatoes ---I can get you money for googling and amazoning with a new tax.  Country cheers!!  This is like listening to my kid rationalize why she shouldn't take out the trash or why should get an allowance.
#####
He is smart and playing smart, everyone else is either really smart or really stupid, playing dumb or really dumb....
#####
That‚Äôs a little too much I work hard for money these people get easy money not getting my vote
#####
would someone on disability get the extra $1000 a month also?
#####
Yang is about numbers, data, and solve our problem with a math solution. the rest just all yapping
#####
Reasonable depth..closer to shore..you create jobs and better fishing..so we can all by boats..that makes more jobs..get the picture?
#####
He has my trump vote..and if you open up the un drilled oil fields..drill at e reasonal
#####
The guy asking the questions is a complete idiot
#####
Throwing money at a problem always fixes it, just look at lottery winners.
#####
I laughed at this guy at first but now that I'm looking into him, i really like him.  He's the only one getting the attention from the conservatives.  Yang 2020!
#####
The only one talking about real economic issues. UBI works with a value added tax
#####
and that is all it took.... you notice the other candidates looking at him thinking " why didn't I come up with this" and they are all silent.... because they cannot argue the logic in his ideas... even the moderator was shut down with logic and facts...he scares them all... thus only 2 questions ....now if ordinary Americans research what he is saying he will wipe out the rest ... the term "trickle up" should have perked up every American watching this...
#####
MSNBC was RUDE.  Turned off MICS !      YANG 2020 / FREEDOM DIVIDEND ......YES!!!
#####
Republicans for YANG üëèüôåüôåüôå
#####
No one interrupted him cus he's speaking facts!
#####
How are you people rating this guy so highly, you'd have to tax these companies at 150% of their market capital just to fund this for one year. 
The pandemic of gimme continues
#####
Wouldn't government giving away money cause inflation, which would cause people to demand even more money from the government?
It would become a vicious cycle.
#####
Yang dosen't fit into.democrat's race profile and he dosen't use race bait, so he won't win.
#####
This debate was totally rigged, here‚Äôs how it would‚Äôve gone if Yang got more time! #Yang2020...  https://youtu.be/vmdtv4pHi2k

Andrew Yang reminds me of Billy Madison... https://youtu.be/LQCU36pkH7c

Dear Andrew yang, if you don‚Äôt win, it‚Äôs not your fault if you don‚Äôt win in a system design for you to loose
#####
This SOB is NOT going to give everyone 1k a month READ MY LIPS...NO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH PER ADULT...When he fails he will blame congress just like every lying politician in our countries history has done. The BS is piling up on the DNC  floor
#####
Staunch Trump supporter, but if for some weird reason I have to vote Democrat, its either Yang or Gabbard.
#####
Too much identity politics, I want comprehensive mathematically backed solutions.  #YANG2020 #HumanityFirst

He answered the question like flying colors.
#####
Didn't Bush give everyone just $300 and it didn't do good for our market/gdp? Plus they only ask this guy 2 questions come on

Every adult gets a 1000 a month? Maybe it was a good thing his mic was cut. That's some crazy shit.

Remember people they bailed out banks that's socialism. Time they help us out Yang 2020

#YANG2020
#####
Yang is a liar. UBI does not work. Nothing new
#####
Crap Fest : Based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions, modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded. Like spoiled, angry children, they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave. A social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice, voluntary cooperation and moral integrity  as liberals do. A political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent, drive, personal appeal and work ethic, and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population  as liberals do. And a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over-regulates and over-taxes the nation's citizens, corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state  as liberals do. The roots of liberalism  and its associated madness  can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind. When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious. Basically liberalism is a willful failure to mature beyond adolescence that can have catastrophic consequences for society. With luck, the official diagnosis of this disease by mental health professionals will facilitate the search for a cure.
#####
The body language of other candidates as Yang is explaining the freedom dividend tells a lot (1:50).
#####
You can't be talking all sophisticated with math and stuff. Most people can't follow
#####
I like how the guy tried to bark back with his argument against the tax but the compensation per month is literally being given to us while the opportunity to make money with an actual job helps stabilize us. Referring to the younger generations specifically. 1000 dollars on top of what I already make would keep me afloat so much easier than without. But America doesn‚Äôt believe in handouts even when it makes sense in the grand scheme of our CURRENT economic structure.
#####
Notice the light in Yang's eyes when he's explaining his policy. He's literally the only HUMAN on that stage. Rest are war mongering sociopaths who only care about lining their own pockets.
#####
Yang. The only adult on that stage.
#####
Ponder this you idiots with your hands out....government funded = tax payer funded.
#####
Marianne Williamson corroborates Yang‚Äôs accusation: https://twitter.com/marwilliamson/status/1144831650783793152?s=09

NBC asked a very loaded question. It was a valid question but a hard ball for Yang. Hes worse for the establishment than Bernie.
#####
This guy is poison for the democrat party.  but also are the ones who support doing away with ICE
#####
Everyone donate more to Yang's campaign, they more they tried to shut Yang down the more stronger he must get.
#####
The more they tried to shut Yang down, the more popular he'll get.  It just goes to show he's the real deal, he has new fresh ideas to advance America.  The corrupt government and news media is trying to silence Yang and shut him down.  Despite all their doings, everyone just needs to support and vote for Yang.
#####
Andrew yang !!!! We need to support this man he will be the new generation of ideas

If everyone is given $1k a month, a jug of milk will cost $30.  The prices of goods we buy everyday will go up 20 fold.  Write it down.

"trillion dollar tech company"
is only worth 134 billion
you might think it's not that much difference, but if Amazon is only making a few billion a year, then he'd be lucky to get 1 billion in taxes from them to fund his 3 TRILLION charity
#####
I'll take 50k in a lump sum thanks.
#####
Do people think 1000/month is a crazier idea than building a wall between us and Mexico?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
#####
How would you do that?
I'm sorry?
You fucking heard me bitch
#####
Real questions. Wont giving everyone 1000 free dollars crash the market? wont retailers just make everything 1000 dollars more expensive? where is this money going to come from?
#####
Spend money you don‚Äôt have on people who didn‚Äôt earn it. Oh wait, just tax the shit out everyone. Just like Bernie who finally admitted that Medicare for all will increase the taxes on the middle class. And I remember Bernie telling everyone that the rich would pay for it. You stupid liberal demoKKKrats.
#####
LOOK:  Yang sucked in this debate.
I like him as a candidate but he was fucking TERRIBLE.
Sure he got very few questions, but he fumbled them badly, acted nervous, and failed
to engage the other candidates.  *F*
#####
Guess what, I'm sick of taxes and more taxes and higher taxes and I don't want your damned handouts. You can't buy loyalty or freedom with dollar bills.
#####
They should have cut off Mr. Beans...I mean Pete Buttgigs mic off and not Ying Yangs.
#####
Why cant we just lower taxes and save money that way rather then putting all our money through the government.  Which by the way has the worst record out of anyone in managing money.
#####
YES YES YES VOTE FOR HIM AND I CAN MOVE COUNTRY TO RECEIVE FREE MONEY FOR NOTHING üòÅüòÅüòÅ
#####
So the short answer is, government can't give you anything they don't take from someone else who earned it.
#####
If Trump wins, he better tap Yang for a Cabinet-level position for a spanking new Dept to address Automation before it SLAMS us! Because the Tech Tsunami is at our doorstep. ‚è≥üåäüö£

Many the European, gulf countries and some Pacific region countries did it.  Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang are the good candidates to against Trump.

I feel like the Republicans had a wild card which was Trump. 

Now its Democrats turn and their wild card is Andrew Yang.
But seriously fuck this debate. Fuck NBC and MSNBC for only asking questions to Bernie, Biden, Harris, and Buttigieg. I can't blame Yang for his passiveness and/or his broken mic but this is a messy debate. Still he got his name/face out there and his proposal

Ubi is not universal. Yang is being obscure on the subject a social welfare programs. But being very clear about one social program. People who receive SSI. The one thing that SSDI and SSI have in common. You must be DISABLED to receive them. People who are on SS and SSDI are able to receive the freedom dividend. People who are on SSI are not. He starting to prove that he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. #humanity first is an empty slogan and he's another politician with broken promises. He's ignoring the most vulnerable in our society. While intending to cut what he considers to be social programs. Forcing people to opt into the freedom dividend. Especially those who are already not able to survive. Ensuring that they are not able to thrive. I WAS IN ADAMANT YANG SUPPORTER. HE'S PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE A FRAUD!!!!!

I'm just going to parrot what many others have said, this video needs MORE eyeballs on it. Spread the word people. Link this and other videos like it in your emails and social media. The UBI thing is going to be the main hurdle for Andrew to sell I believe. Particularly that EVERYONE will receive it. So be it. Andrew and Tulsi together would bring a lot of thoughtful/intelligent (there are many) Republicans on-board.

Other candidates are just old politics without effect. Yang seems to try to solve the issues. Think of him as "BIZARRO TRUMP".
#####
Andrew Yang is the best presidential candidate in US history ever.  He has vision, eloquent, straightforward, elegant and can actually form sentences without personally attacking other candidates, previous and current US presidents.

....Andrew Yang has created a Dizzying list of more than 100+ policies !!!!,....and the number is growing and growing....hundreds by 2020....? ;  among those policies are medicare for all, the UBI, the paid family leave, $100 vouchers for all Americans to donate to nonprofits, reviving earmarks to make bills easier to pass, hiring a White House psychologist, legal marijuana, geoengineering to fight global warming, etc ...etc....etc...some of his policies seem to be grounded in Math. and data....
Andrew Yang began his Presidential Campaign on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic Primaries. 
Yang says his campaign is about facts, solutions, and people....but the real fact is that ...after "18 months" of Presidential Campaign....!, his great Town Halls, interviews, rallies, speeches, after so much Media attention, there is no doubt Yang has become a very well known presidential candidate these days...but now on May 2019, he averages "only" 0 to 1 percent in Nationwide Public Opinion Polls....
Andrew Yang has no shortage of things to talk about, he dreams Big !!!!....but Political History, Reality, and Pragmatism have always shown us that Math. and good intentions not always give such a huge number of ideas and policies the chance of being carried out and accomplished successfully for so many reasons.... they become very often a fiction novel, not a real platform.......

I didn't think I could like him more than I already did, and then he starts talking about the potential of blockchain tech.

This is incredibly exciting. The first presidential candidate who's talking internet & automation as significant milestones to prepare for.

can we get an actual thumbnail? People‚Äôll think this is an opinion piece instead of an interview

Andrew Yang is drinking a lot of water and that is good.  However he needs to take either magnesium bisglycinate or electrolyte drink.  Here is a description of the electrolyte.  Quote Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electric charge when they are dissolved in a liquid such as blood. The blood electrolytes‚Äîsodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate‚Äîhelp regulate nerve and muscle function and maintain acid-base balance and water balance. Unquote  Andrew Yang should keep his health in tip top condition.
#####
0 dislikes? That‚Äôs all you need to know about Yang
Edit: the two dislikes are Trump and the DNC
#####
I'm a huge fan of Andrew Yang but this is the first time I've seen him not give the interviewer as much acknowledgement as he usually would. Did anyone else notice this. 
As for his message, no one is even close to him.
#####
The most forward thinking candidate in history.
#####
Yang....not one to beat around the bush. Foresee the threat of IT revolution or the losses of jobs to The Forth Industrial revolution. This is REAL... (to which the under current is building up to a crescendo ) and sadly so with no other candidates talking about it. Read his OVER A 100 POLICIES  IN PLACE. He is god send for America and the global stabilization. Wish him well from Malaysia.
#####
I looked for this video for like 2 hours a couple weeks ago, glad to see it uploaded

Love how Yang is man crushing on my man Joe Rogan in the middle of answering a question.

Yang is a genius, I can't wait to vote for him in the primaries & the general electron!
#####
Hahaha Paper, yeah! #1vsM

Take the pink hat away from those that would have an evil meaning to it. If you wholesale buy into the pink hats, Yang, then Yang Gang controls the narrative as to what the hat stands for. It stands for Yang Gang, and nothing more. Yang Gang! BTW, I actually prefer the MATH hat and likely wouldn't even get a pink vaporwave hat. But, I don't think you should allow someone else to set the narrative. Take it away from those that would twist it.
#####
great interview. just when u think u can‚Äôt like the guy more...
#####
Such a weird part about the pink hats. That color has been the one point of contention they  haven't gave a clear comment about over the last couple of months. This is the first time I have seen him acknowledge them. I guess reddish colors could paint him as a republican, and he already is pretty borderline. OR I know it could be used against them later as ripping trump to closely, that is probably what they are worried about most. But it certainly means a lot to his 4chan base.
#####
This video should be getting more views. Come on people! Vote AndrewYang2020! I have a autograph baseball from Mr. President Yang, met him in Detroit before anyone knew about him. Love the guy!

Great interview. We desperately need Andrew Yang as president in 2020... unless you like looking back to the past, glorifying the 1950's, having leaders who don't know anything about technology, etc... But if you live in the 21st century....

Hoo hoo!! I knew it: Official Pink Hats to come (probably doe the general)!

Yang #1 -- no other candidate is even in the same game much less field. Problem solver vs bluster and nothing solved.
#####
We need to empower Americans to choose what we want to do instead of slaving away on a job out of sheer desperation & $1k a mo. helps us w/ that. It doesn't limit us by clinging on to a shit job, we can pool w/ other recipients to invest or start a business, go back to school or find a new career path. This isn't welfare, w/c is conditional, it's just $12,000 a year for each adult. That's $2000 a mo. for each household w/ 2 adults, a real life saver. üíØ #yang2020

I'd love to see the hologram in all its iterations because it would allow Andrew to get his word out to more places, simultaneously.  But I can see how many people would pooh-pooh it, criticizing it without using their underdeveloped critical thinking skills.  I mean, everyone can only be in one place at a time.  The hologram wouldn't be a gimmick, but some people would claim that it was.  As part of his message as an intro, he'd have to make a statement addressing that criticism.
#####
MARIJUANA ALONE WOULD PAY FOR UBI

Watching from Canada.  You Americans are extremely lucky to have this man run for President.  Wish we had someone like him for Prime Minister.
#####
Let‚Äôs go. Like share and comment =)

Yang is the only Dem candidate talking real sense who has a shot. I like Gabbard as well, but she is so against the Military Industrial Complex they would just have her killed in a "Training Accident". As far as "Empowering Women", Hitchens would be on board with Yang.

Andrew has the solutions to all the US problems.  Trump does not.  Andrew will make the lives of the working poor so much better.  Yang 2020.
#####
This man exceeds the necessary intellect and compassion needed to be the next President of the United States of America, because if Bernie is elected it will only cause a gridlock in congress where nothing will get done which will be basically the same old same old. If this country cares at all about maintaining itself in tact for any foreseeable future it needs to elect this man because anything less at this point in this country‚Äôs history will cause nothing but more divisions and essentially anarchy over the mismanagement of the government.

Yang had a campaign vlog about his prep for this meeting, the vlog showed he chewed a chocolate coated espresso bean, given out by Caribou Coffee for his morning coffee, and worried if he would get too hyper, and then they ran from their car to the building in the rain ... see https://youtu.be/TLF130rRg7o

A FLAKE WITH ONE PLAN TO BUY VOTES FOR $1K A MONTH. NO IDEA HOW THIS GETS PAID FOR.

Imagine if Yang wins, it would be interesting when comes to talking trade with China-son of Taiwanese parents talk to Head of Communist China.  It is almost as if Taiwan wins in the end.
#####
I think his mission is to bring the truth to Americans faces, whether he wins or not.
#####
This 4th industrial revolution - call it the AI REVOLUTION - IS VERY DIFFERENT from the previous ones. It is going to spawn AIs that will be capable of replacing humans not only at the work benches but also at an evolutionary scale.


Think of it:
1) AIs (and, I am thinking of the benign "DATA" of Star Trek fame) can build their future AIs. Humans are no longer needed to design the next generation of AIs. In the past, humans were always needed to build the next generation of machines. Which led to better jobs replacing poorer jobs! After the AI Revolution, there will be no better jobs for humans. We can be in cages in Zoological parks, entirely managed by AIs. Maybe, this scenario is 50 to 100 years into the future, but it is bound to come.
2) All past automations have attempted to replace the human brawn with machines. The AI REVOLUTION will replace the human brain. Think of DATA's "positronic" brain that is capable of not only computing and recalling data at quantum computing speeds but also capable of empathizing and having a 'consciousness' like the humans.
3) We already know what the current systems are capable of doing. As Yuval HARARI says, they are capable of hacking into our brains - identifying our likes and dislikes, our addictions and weaknesses. This has never happened before. Imagine what the future AIs - DATAs of the Star Trek - will be capable of?


Folks, listen to Andrew YANG. He is showing us the "WAY  FORWARD".
#####
Yellow peril !!!

Is it TOO MUCH to ask for the rest of America to vote for the smartest candidate, Andrew Yang?    The person who had to provide healthcare for hundreds of people while running his NON profit business to create entrepreneurs......... THAT ABOUT SUMS UP WHAT AMERICA NEEDS!
#####
ANDREW IN 2020
smarter truth, improving all options
Vote ppl.
warren for VP
#####
I'm one of THOSE people: I was really put off by Yang's repeated touching of his stuffy nose, especially with his right hand. Gross! It's impossible for me to hear him when he is sniffing and wiping his nose with his hand. Sorry.
#####
This is the first Yang interview I've watched that I thought he was kinda cringe (some jokes didn't land, he didn't gel with the interviewer and she seemed to be offended, etc.) He's still much more intelligent than someone like our current president, but still--first time I was "meh" instead of excited.
#####
Farmersand other companies are using robots no need for immigrants and illegals coming to the US for jobs. Americans are no longer gonna have jobs either so someone is gonna have to feed all the humans.
#####
Yang is special interest. He has repeatedly stated replace humans with AI. He states it is inevitable. It is not inevitable. He and his AI friends are not the "Borg Collective", even if; We "Humans" control our future. If it is inevitable that we believe robots are in control, then have robots pay 75% of the income to the replaced human. This is our control.  Listen to him. Stating we "people" should be entrepreneurs to something, to listen to other people, like him... This means let him and his special interested friends create more replacing humans AI and be happy. Do not let him happen. We do have control over the human and the AI future and scope.
#####
I literally forgot I was watching a political campaign 
It feels like a ted talk lmaoo

This Entrepreneur is incredible , he has lot of new ideas, visions etc....wish he becomes the next President of United States. God Bless you, Mr. Yang.

Remember, you gotta vote for Andrew Yang in real life too, not just in YouTube comments...

The burgeoning tech industry in Iowa...unbelievable! Definitely looks rich techie, with mood lighting, faux fur pillows, and a sleek, elitist vibe. He was very prickly in this talk. A lot of awkward moments here. I don't feel he likes his interviewer much, though she's a VP and general counsel of a startup, and she's a high-powered, successful Asian like himself. He's putting her down and interrupting her a few times, something I've never seen in other videos of his. And in the end, she thanks him, he doesn't pay attention and just thanks the crowd, didn't shake her hand, and went off the state himself without acknowledging her. That's very cringey - I get treated like that all the time, too. First Yang video I'm downvoting.
#####
I've been a Bernie supporter for 15+ years now, long before he ever ran for President. I love Bernie's ideas and he's on the right track. 

But sadly, many people think he's crazy and they hate the word socialism (even though they applaud nearly every socialistic program we have in the US (which includes the military, police, firemen, and even the government itself)). 

Andrew Yang is an apolitical figure. He's running on the Democrat ticket, but he's not a Democrat, nor is he a Republican. He's a data-driven techie that understands how to solve problems and understands that our metrics for success are all wrong. 

I will vote for Yang over Bernie, even though I still love Bernie. I would vote for Bernie if he got the nomination, but I'd vote for Trump if they put any other candidate up for the nomination because this country will never get better unless it collapses, and it will under another 4 years of Trump. The New Deal would never have passed without the GD, so instead of kicking the can down the road with another neoliberal candidate, I'd prefer to elect someone who will destroy us so that we can rebuild once the dust settles. 

So Yang, you've got my vote and I'll be donating to your campaign right after posting this.
#####
Andrew yang is smart, authentic, solutions-oriented, does not play the race game. Try finding another candidate like him.

The interviewer is not witty enough to handle Yang

How can Americans not jump at the chance to have such a genuine and brilliant President. Aren't Americans sick and tired of the typical phony politician's tone and strategic tactics of getting your vote (telling people what they want to hear and then doing nothing policy wise). What is wrong with just being "real" and giving the people the credit to come to their own rational decision based on well explained proposals and policies?  In my opinion it takes two things to make a great leader and those are genuineness and brilliance and Yang clearly has both in spades. What other candidates never points fingers and blames others? Yang realizes the importance of uniting Americans in such a divided America, so he doesn't play the "blame game", which is detrimental to progression. Yang has convinced more Trump supporters than all the blaming and accusing of other candidates. Bernie is up there for sure, but I think Yang is a better candidate and will accomplish more.
#####
What a perfect underdog. Yang2020

The ONLY intelligent option for the future of our country.

And by future I mean for our lifetimes and not just the election cycle like most politicians.
#####
So many deepstate funded troll accounts! There isn't a Trump supporter in the nation who would fall for the lies of progressives like Yang. 100 million Christians were slaughtered at the hands of the communists - over 10 times as many as Jews killed by Nazi's! The deceptive tactics the political Left is now using in the US are exactly how both Nazi's and Communists rose into power. As Yuri Bezmenov warned us back in 85 "This is what will happen in United States if you allow all these schmucks to bring the country to crisis..."

I'd prefer to compare their beauty to the endless depths of space. Forever beautiful, always gorgeous, and infinitely marvelous.
#####
#yanggang, but his treatment of Adrienne is very problematic. He consistently interrupted her and ignored her handshake at the end. Also, early in the interview he jokingly called one of her questions silly. I hope someone has brought this to his attention and he has apologized to her.
#####
Never seen anyone like him, perhaps his most difficult accomplishment is having 99% of people in every comments section praising him.  Thats happened NEVER.  This is the president we need to really make America great again and think harder =D.
#####
This is the first candidate that I am sending a donation to MONTHLY!
#####
Yang 2020! Spread his message to everyone you know, awareness and recognition is the most important thing for him right now!
#####
I love the comments Yang made about what the market is incapable of doing: the excess supply of labor at the age of automation.
#####
Politics aside, this was really interesting to listen to! I'd love to hear Yang have a discussion with Noah Yuval Harari one day.
#####
Independent here voting for Yang!
#####
Andrew has my respect and vote

Ummmmm I think i have a crush on our future president lol!  He‚Äôs so charismatic, brilliant, a strange (in a great way) sense of humor and he has a plan of action for ALL the issues. Impressed.
#####

#####
Having done a little bit of work with the IRS, upgrading their archaic mainframe system would take at minimum 5 years if everything goes smoothly. It's one thing to say "automate the IRS", but it's another thing to execute it. The number of business rules used to manage tax filing is huge and in the thousands. to make things worse, every year changes to the tax laws need to be implemented. it can be done, but we need to be realistic.
#####
Lets be honest about keeping up with technology and especially security. More than half the working programmers have no clue about security and don't practice good security. Go ask a real security expert how well private companies implement security. If the IT industry sucks at security, how the heck is the government suppose to be "up-to-date"? 

Absolutely everyone can get better at technology, but lets be totally blunt. The rate of change is far beyond what people can manage. Take AI as the prime example. Even people in the AI field can't keep up with the pace of research. I read as much as I can, but I can't keep up. No matter how many papers on ML I read on arxiv.org, there simply isn't enough hours in a day to keep up.

Clearly getting rid of technology advisory group in government was stupid, but we shouldn't pretend the private sector does a great job. How many companies have had major security breaks over the last 5 years?

So ya'll know... his tech jokes are on point.
#####
He has the right idea. However, it does not fix what is wrong with America. The corporations are too powerful because American workers do not have a seat at the table; that is why unions evolved. Now that unions have been destroyed, through a succession of many laws through Congress, everything is now bent in favor of the Corporate state, thanks to the Supreme Court's major decision that corporations are people, and therefore right to free speech through money to buy out the politicians. The last time that I checked, corporations are pieces of paper; not breathing, living, organisms defined as human. The Supreme Court in no way can proclaim its "infinite wisdom"; quite to the contrary. Where I have problems with Yang, is that he feeds into the false narrative that corporations that he helps to fund makes things better, when in fact they eventually sell out to the highest bidder, which means its employees are now without jobs, and the "owners" become rich, just as Yang did. The only solution is when the employees have a 'one person, one stock, one vote' and not leave everything to the greedy board of directors. Everything else about Yang sounds good, but he does not see the whole picture of how America was destroyed starting with the Powell Memo. And Yang is not conversant on the topic at all because his obsession with numbers cannot override the damage done by the Koch Brothers and Powell at the political money, spending billions to destroy the country at the street level. The Tea Party was funded by Kochs.
#####
I see that this point of view has not been formulated commonly:

What about a Yang/Buttigieg ticket?

I personally really enjoy a lot of what Buttigieg stands for morally and he would be perfect in a vice presidential role while having Yang as the executive force driving real change in the USA

I don‚Äôt really know a lot about politics yet, but I hope I can learn a lot from y‚Äôall

It appears that few people are connecting the dots of future indices that are separately presented by Andrew Yang, Yuval Noah Harari and others who are painting a very grim, but highly plausible, picture of what lies in store for humanity in just a few decades or so.  Personally, I take these predictions with a boulder of salt since I am  convinced that Dr. Guy McPherson's projection of the irreversible and inevitable end of life on this planet in just a decade or so - which is rapidly gaining traction among the most knowledgeable climatologists - is correct and that all these futuristic predictions are just so much blather.  But, assuming that humankind - and all its supportive life forms - will indeed survive for a century or more, not one of these futurists seem to be touching on the one enveloping issue that remains unspoken, but necessary given their predictions.  And so, I guess it befalls unto me to raise that specter:  If we are to survive the 6th Mass Extinction and humankind is to continue forward indefinitely, the common key to our survival will be - dare I say it -  "Negative Population Growth."   Paul Erlich started this conversation about 40 years ago, but nobody was talking back.  Now, no matter what, the predictions of Yang, Harari and others, while brave and clear-minded enough, fail to mention that the most pressing problem facing humanity next to abrupt climate change - and more than nuclear war, pandemics and other external population reduction devices, natural and otherwise - is the gross overpopulation of humans on the face of this planet.  So, assuming that there will be a miraculous way discovered to avoid our extinction as a species (along with most other species) within the next couple of decades, the human race will have to move quickly toward reducing its global population to probably one-third to one-fourth of what it now is, if we are to avert our demise through war, famine or other catastrophe.  This will require intense and rapid population decline, fostered by mandatory sterilization and other means of creating an equation, whereby many more people die over the next century than are born.  MANY more.  If not, then all this effort in saving our species and profiting from future technology will be erased simply by poverty and the inability of governments to sustain themselves economically - and thus to govern us effectively.
#####
I have watched two vids now featuring Mr. Yang, and I am interested to see how he does. I get that he is speaking at a tech conference, but in neither video has he addressed some of the other important (to me) issues that he will face if elected. Namely:
Global warming. Illegal immigration/path to citizenship/dreamers, etc. Russian belligerence/aggression. Middle East mess. N. Korea. Military industrial complex. World overpopulation. Infrastructure repair/maintenance. Freedom from religion/protecting women's right to choose. Universal health care (he started to touch on it and quickly changed direction). Restoring Obama era policies that trump has killed (environmental/science, etc). Trade. Forest  management/health (especially in the West). There are more. He is not going to get there on speaking on tech alone.  I am an old goat, and tech does not terribly excite me. Give me something to get excited about.
#####
Turn on caption and go to 29:48
#####
I‚Äôm just worried that people might frame him as too economically and tech related as when he was asked a question about if he has any non-tech/economics related policies, he just referred the asker to his website of 105 policies. No idea if this might cast a shadow of doubt over the people unsure about him or those who‚Äôve never heard about him. I still hope that he‚Äôs able to win over the American people bit by bit! #yang2020

1000$ a month for every 326+ million people in the United states. Where are we going to get the money to support this for 4 years? Especially if we have lazy people who dont want to work?

Heres what i believe, get off your lazy asses and get a job. Thats how you make money. You can save money or even invest to have more for the future. 
And if you dont like the job you're currently at and or it doesnt pay much then get a better job. 
Thought I'd never have to explain basic stuff to people ü§∑ü§¶

Andrew Yang I will b voting for u!

Thank you Andrew!!!

Also the dems seem to always forget that attracting crowds in New York, a deep blue city, is not really any achievement for a dem candidate... especially in Washington Square Park, are you kidding me? that's like the red square for all the commie leftie loonies, Trump saw through this so he never even bothered to win over this place, because he knew that's not the whole picture of America, but rather a fantasized hipster theme park. And don't get me wrong, he was born and raised in New York, so for him to see through this illusion and actually broke out of this little mirage and spoke to the whole nation, that alone made him the greatest visionary among all candidates. This yang guy knows it, he's not gonna have a path to the White House by being a star in the West Village, and this rally is just for show that he too can get some votes, then as a leverage to get a cabinet position from the dnc, in exchange for his endorsement for w/e emerges as the dem nominee eventually, nothing more than a negotiating tactic, what is he looking at, DoL? DoT maybe? But it's not gonna work anyway, because Trump will secure another 4 years with ease if this is the kinda shit the dems can muster, LOL
#####
So there was the bs candidate (bernie sanders) and then there is this guy, $1000 a month for everyone? And here I thought asians were supposed to be good at math: do the simple calculation, 1000(dollars) x 12(months) x 300,000,000 (US population) = 3.6 TRILLION DOLLARS, PER YEAR! When Trump took office the national debt was 19.9 tn, now it reached 22 tn, so in 2 years it rose 2.1 tn which comes to roughly 1 trillion dollars per year, and the dems are already crying day and night accusing Trump for ruining the country. What this guy advocates, only this genius $1000 policy alone, will add 3.6 trillion dollars debt to the US EVERY SINGLE YEAR, and the dems are saying he's the hope? LMFAO, please do let him be the dem nominee, just to save Trump some time from campaigning so he has more time for governing, because Trump will win by default! LOL
#####
What a breath of fresh air!  Finally a political figure that understands humanity first!  Not banks and the so called 'elites'!  Enough with the tired and old ways that have chained us all to become economic slaves!  Time for HUMANITY FIRST!!!!!!

We can't give up! Spread the word of his policies and ideas. Before i knew who yang was, i had NO opinion on the upcoming election. People need to know that he is here! As soon as i googled him, i was sold. People need to know!!!!

For the people just hearing about Andrew Yang...

Universal Basic Income is NOT socialism. 

It‚Äôs capitalism that doesn‚Äôt start at ZERO!
#####
just what we need
#####
can anyone hook me up with those posters?
#####
There are 327 million people living in America.¬† Of those, 16% have an IQ of 85 or less.¬† 

Thats around 52 million people who can look forward to a career as Unskilled laborer, Gardener, Janitor, Maid or a Dishwasher.

Yangs planned UBI would allow this population to grow in numbers.

Start in 2020 with 52,000,000 people with sub 85 IQs and assume a 3% growthrate then check back in 2021 and you will find that Yang will have funded the births of an additional 1.5 million low IQ people.¬† 

Check back in 2024 - once people realize the horrible mistake they made in electing Yang - and you will find that the original low IQ population of 52,000,000 has grown to a population of 58,526,458.¬† All with sub 85 IQs.

This is unsustainable.¬† 

UBI is a universally Bad Idea.
#####
VAT (Value Added Tax) is a CONSUMPTION TAX paid by the CONSUMER¬† not the business.

Yang will be taxing consumers to provide consumers with his freedom dividend. 

Yang will be Yangking money out of the hands of the rich and middle class and giving it to the poor who will spend it in stores. 

This will just increase profits for businesses and further encourage them to automate.

Lets just call it what it is.

A YAT.

A Yang Added Tax.
#####
Andrew Yang you are wrong!

We did not automate away 4 million manufacturing jobs.

Economists have been misreading the statistics.¬† A new study proves this.

https://qz.com/1269172/the-epic-mistake-about-manufacturing-thats-cost-americans-millions-of-jobs/

"Foreign competition, not automation, was behind the stunning loss in factory jobs."

NOT AUTOMATION

OMG I love him

Andrew Yang is the real deal, and is gaining a lot of momentum. I predict you will see him seen as one of the top 5 candidates in a couple of months.

Forward, bitches!

Yang Gang spread the word!!!
#####
This guy sounds too good to be true lol.
#####
UBI is a tax break for most Americans. I paid $14,000 in taxes, so $12,000 would reduce my tax burden to $2000. Even if we had $500 per month in UBI, that's $6000 in tax breaks. UBI bails out the middle class and helps reduce inefficiencies in government bureaucracy. Win-win because tax breaks are good. 

The benefits of autonomous technology won't be felt the right way. Capitalism works slow. Before things get better, autonomous technology has to disrupt industry left and right. That means massive layoffs and economic instability for many Americans. Retraining, relocating, and re-educating citizen will take years.  UBI buffers the instability while we transition into an autonomous world.
#####
The problem with America is that this type of capable politicians don't have lot of exposure, those who has a big mouth and make biggest noise does, like dunkey trump.
#####
Yang gang!

I like #Yang!

Not such a "longshot". If you check his website, he's done the MATH. Yang2020.com

i would love an extra grand to spend on bullshit every month sounds great lol oh wait property values will increase cause more wealth is being put into community raising rents to extremely high cost like NY or san fran i remember living in alaska my step bro loved that check he got but i hated almost 2$ for a cup of fucken top ramen

i will never vote for democrats  he will have to run as independent for my vote. demorats are pure evil
#####
This person is a horrible reporter. "basic income... kind of a longshot, but an interesting proposal!" - what hard-hitting, detailed analysis. if you are wondering why we are all so stupid, it is in part coverage like this.
#####
I'm filling in the circle next to "Yang" in 2020.
#####
My advice is not bash Trump, focus in real issues.
#####
Main stream media can't keep ignoring him. 

He is by far the best/most inspiring candidate running in the election!
#####
Dont vote for him. 

If he gets elected, asian men will gain power and status within the country and will use that advantage against white men. You cant forget the fact that asian men are some of the worlds most misogynist people. Even their own women dont like them and prefer to marry white guys.
#####
I‚Äôm torn between him and Bernie.
#####
He‚Äôs too smart for politics that‚Äôs why trump won he speaks to the low iq religious sheep.


Good luck getting those pearl , Bible & Walmart shopping southerners voting for anti ‚ÄúsOcIaLiSM‚Äù. 

Good luck I honestly mean it , good luck!

Dont listen to the Russian bullshit trolls in the comments. Yang2020

Literally our only hope.
#####
$1,000/month will go straight to my savings! It‚Äôs going to help me out so much. Also, I‚Äôm on board with every single policy he has put out. This guy actually will make American thrive for everyone.
#####
Trump became the president because he spoke directly without the wishy washy politicians use. He might have been wrong on many subjects, but at least he spoke directly.
#####
He doesn't insult others enough. He needs to find a group for his supporters to hate or he won't win. Americans like blaming others to solve thier problems, that's how Trump won.
#####
I love this guy. He is so smart and he doesn't want to divide us! #Yang2020. #notLeftorRightbutForward #HumanityFirst
#####
To be honest, I‚Äôm a little glad trump won. It drew a line in the sand and made it so that only realistic non-politiciany people like Yang can resonate with us. 

Trump is the darkness before the dawn where we‚Äôll see real change.

On the yang gang!

I had a dream Yang didn‚Äôt make it to the primaries‚Ä¶ and I cried

Why does the media always say that UBI is a long shot? It already exists in other places and has been an idea since the founding of the country. Plus Yang has the most constructive way of funding it so idk why it seems so hard to understand

aw man i wish i knew about yang when this happpened
#####
Im deeply troubled by the fact that i have no way to influence the primaries, i hate our political parties and i hate the backwards cronyism that forces every election into a lesser of to shitty choices.
How do i help this campain?
I cant.
And its absolute bs, 
The democratic part is making all these candidates raise money and its pointless  its a burden on american citizens to try to compete with huge corperate donations and it makes no sense, it cost almost nothing to post more videos or tweet or post to facebook it does not cost millions to travel to different cities, what the hell is this obsession with money?
Anytime someone with a bit of common sense and few decent ideas gets up and tries to run the clickbait soundbite generating professional noismakers talk over them and get all the attention.
How did we end up this way?
I try to do the simple thing, spread the word talk about it, but half the people i know will never vote for a democrat, and the other half are like me and to busy with work to go to rallies and i just feel like the majority of people have no voice and arent given enough information in the nonsense news about the candidates because they cant share any information beond  a soundbite and the incumbents latest twitter post!

Good rally for Andrew Yang, the next US president.

Highlight that you are
 the most forward thinking candidate

IF YOU RECEIVE SSI YOU WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND. IF YOU HAVE SSDI CAN YOU QUALIFY. IF YOU HAVE SSI ANDREW YANG INTENDS TO TAKE AWAY THAT SOCIAL PROGRAM.

Yang needs to crowd surf at his rallies.

America is not ready for an Asian president right now.  I wish it wasn‚Äôt so but it‚Äôs today‚Äôs reality.
#####
Andrew Yang is actually pretty tall. He‚Äôs taller than Bill Maher when standing next to him, but he looks short. I think it‚Äôs because Yang has a small head for his body size. I suggest he grow his hair out longer to optically increase the size of his head and go on a KETO diet to tighten his body. He‚Äôs Asian already and needs all the help he can get in the image department. Image sells.
#####
He is a candidate that is loved and respected, how rare is that?
#####
....Andrew Yang has created a Dizzying list of more than 100+ policies !!!!,....and the number is growing and growing....hundreds by 2020....? ; among those policies are medicare for all, the UBI, the paid family leave, $100 vouchers for all Americans to donate to nonprofits, reviving earmarks to make bills easier to pass, hiring a White House psychologist, legal marijuana, geoengineering to fight global warming, etc ...etc....etc...some of his policies seem to be grounded in Math. and data.... 

Andrew Yang began his Presidential Campaign on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic Primaries. Yang says his campaign is about facts, solutions, and people....but the real fact is that ...after "18 months" of Presidential Campaign....!, his great Town Halls, interviews, rallies, speeches, after so much Media attention, there is no doubt Yang has become a very well known presidential candidate these days...but now on May 2019, he averages "only" 0 to 1 percent in Nationwide Public Opinion Polls.... 

Andrew Yang has no shortage of things to talk about, he dreams Big !!!!....but Political History, Reality, and Pragmatism have always shown us that Math. and good intentions not always give such a huge number of ideas and policies the chance of being carried out and accomplished successfully for so many reasons.... they become very often a fiction novel, not a real platform....


¬†..." Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be "..... ( A. Einstein ).
#####
Revolutionise politics.
Every adult to be tied to the STATE via U.B.I.
STATE to reward activities it sees as contributory to the long-term national plan.
Disincentives for non-compliance.
The encouragement of thousands of small and local businesses depending on the approval of the STATE
All Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist Party policies.
I am sure more will be revealed as people approve to have Marxist-Leninism with 'American characteristics'.

Yang. I am hoping that you reconsider your new stance on taking away housing assistance for people that opt into ubi. I am in the Bay Area and rent is $2000 and up for a single room. The cheapest I can find is $732 for a room in a 3 bedroom house with 2 other people. We are government assistance tenants as are millions across America and cost of living is high here. $4 for gas and milk;  $25 for 2 movie tickets ($33 if they‚Äôre 3D) and that doesn‚Äôt cover popcorn and soda where one date is going to run someone well over $50 easy. I pay into social security and it doesn‚Äôt seem right that I‚Äôm paying their way and they‚Äôre getting ubi on top of social security (keep in mind many of them are working and receive a check on top of ss plus whatever they‚Äôve saved in a lifetime) plus they will get ubi; while I‚Äôm bustin my ass full time to make a living and am not getting ahead. I was really hoping to save some ubi for my future and be able to spend some of it as well in my local community but now that seems lost

I'd vote for him after President Trump's next elected term is up. Which is going to happen whether we like it or not.  Though I will say if it comes down to Trump or Yang this coming election, I'll vote Yang.  Sadly that won't happen, he's too honest.
#####
We need someone like Yang to help get us get into the 21st century.
#####
Give me free money, and clean up my debt for me.  I deserve free $$$, healthcare and schooling.
#####
He knows his math and knows how to distribute it.... wish him all the best!
#####
He makes too much sense people need to come to realize what Andrew is saying.  He is the better candidate out of them all.  Trump couldn‚Äôt hold up to him in a debate.  He would eat him alive.
#####
1000 dollar # you got  week off   In world  anywhere # lets not ask   @ shutdown building

Update Brian wire fellows
#####
Horrible idea
#####
What a bunch of poppycock!  This guy lives in a fantasy land.
#####
Take the FUGGIN tie off my bro!
#####
Im no genius and this would be the first time i would vote but if you gave every adult 1000 dollars wouldnt that motivate people not to work?Thus increase unemployment
#####
For the love of god....please let this man be president !!!
#####
A vote for anyone else is minus $1000 in your pocket every month. The choice is easy. Don‚Äôt be dumb. Vote Andrew Yang!
#####
The utter disrespect from CNN and MSNBC is disgraceful. They are the same as Fox and have their own agenda. Andrew Yang is the only candidate who is reaching out to BOTH sides and truly cares about uniting us all. Everyone else is yelling in an echo-chamber. Kudos to Yang.
#####
This is what is wrong with the US elections. People with the best ideas in trying to help this great nation of ours is never allowed to speak. It is the same old BS. To add more bias on top of that, Andrew, who is an American of Chinese descent will surely be snubbed everywhere. As much as they do not want to admit it, they are afraid. Here we are at 20 trillion dollars in debt, with 2 super powers at our necks, and all the liberals and the GOP want to do is to tear us apart. Andrew made the most sense on that stage and as top economic professors have already pointed out,  this can work because the money is spent here. Reagan's "Trickle Down Economics" once worked because most companies had American workers and they spent here. It is not like Apple where 65% of their work force is abroad manufacturing the products. Where you think those workers are going to spend the money they earned? In the US?
#####
i never voted before because none of the candidates effected me and nothing iterested me but after watching some of yangs stuff i feel like he is the future of america
#####
Finally a candidate with a brain cell
#####
1000 a month is really a tax rebate for every single citizens Between local state and federal taxes paid by everyday people Uncle sam still come out way ahead
#####
YAng or tulsi only wins I would vote for and I‚Äôm a republican . We need to move forward
#####
Seems to be the only Democrat who‚Äôs running to help the American people like Trump.  He is by far the only one on that stage I think could have a chance.
#####
Yeah! more free stuff for the people. Now someone has to out due him and raise it to $1500  I'm just gong to quit working at that point
#####

Social media is killing mainstream media. They wont be able to keep him quiet.
#####
1000 for each adult is 196 trillion dollars a month
#####
Most truthful and understanding guy out there!!! He says the economy is "strong" but the average person is having trouble paying bills while Depression, Suicide and Drug Over-Doses are at Record highs!! His call for a 1000 dollar a month basic income for all adults is the answer to so many alienation, economic and social/stress problems!! He is a successful business man that knows the pulse of the nation and speaks for the majority of people that have nothing to their name!!! All legislators are getting big government salaries and benefits on top of half being millionaires to start and you want nothing back for your self!! Wake up people!!
#####
260,000,000 x $12,000 =
$3,120 trn per year.
$3,120,000,000,000
Amazon etc can afford that.
#####
JAJAJAJAJAJAAJAJAJJAJ
#####
Yang has my vote!
#####
He is the best believe me,  he is not a politician, he is a problem solver...he is the one that would fix so many inequalities in US! Ofcourse he is not good in debates with a dozen people, thats cause serious & focused people are not fakers or celebrities...Even Newton, Einstein, Tesla would have nothing to say in these debates, & lose, cause its a soundbite for tv afterall! But we know better!!!
#####
CLEARLY,  the establishment does NOT WANT POOR PEOPLE to have enough $ to easily get by becuz they need us to be their DESPERATE CORP SLAVES! Think about it ~ Yang offers a way out but also not enuf in my view. We need to RAISE the cap on Soc Sec and also a UBI ~ WITHOUT HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EARNED SSI SOC SEC or UBI. Corporatists r afraid to give poor people too much money, cuz they need us to be their slaves- it needs to be repeated so people get it~
#####
Yang is another socialist moron.
#####
IF YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR YANG MAKE SURE YOURE REGISTERED AS A DEM FOR THE PRIMARIES
#####
I don't think 1k would make much difference for ppl.  More like 3k. Because If you're a lower income person, not only do u have expenses like rent, gas, food, clothes, etc. but you also have the credit card debt you've racked up paying for problems like flat tire, car repair, braces, medical emergency, broken window...
#####

$1000 a month from the government sounds great, until they decide to stop paying.

Andrew Yang = CHINA
Andrew Yang = 
United states in broken banking



China greater economic power than the US
GO GO ANDREW YANG  , CHINA SUPPORTS YOU!
#####
hes the only democratic candidate that someone in the center can actually vote everyone else is just trying to out social justice each other
#####
Andrew Yang is what the world needs! Advanced logic and cares about the future generations to come
#####
Funny thing is that he had way less time to talk and he was trending on twitter LOL take that NBC
#####
*Bam* voted.
#####
Here is a guy that will run the country far better than ten Trump. Yet he is marginalised because of the colour of his skin.  Pretty obvious.
#####
Zionist lobby trying to smear MR.Yang because of the supports he received from Mr Cornell West and Danny Glover ....Both pro BDS and anti Israhell apartheid.
#####
I‚Äôm a black man , I know this man is President material regardless of race fax üì†
#####
It‚Äôs a sad day in America when the most intelligent and sensible democrat only has 0-2% support in the party
#####
Please inform your family and friends about Andrew Yang even if you don't live in the United States (especially if you've got US relatives).  If he's elected in 2020 that will immediately lift 40 million Americas out of poverty.  Once enacted there's no way the American people will allow it to be revoked.  It will spread to the United Kingdom, Canada, Finland and other developed nations.  It will be one of the greatest victories for democracy.  It will put us on course for the Universal Basic Income Treaty so that all citizens on Earth will have a basic income floor on which to grow.
#####
Pete looks shook. Then remembers to take notes on Andrew Yang's talking points.
#####
It's like letting an HIV+ gay man telling you why you should spread your cheeks for him...
#####
Very low interest car loans which can be paid by low income people would boost the morale of low income people. At least they would have a nice car.
#####
Why is Andrew yang so great I'm not American so I don't get it
#####
Michael Tracy is  a class one lunatic psychopath and a total Lier, simple as that.
#####
He won the debate when he barely spoke.....
#####
Love it how no other candidate challenged Yang on his UBI proposal.
#####
things that would work in America will never work in America
#####
....A presidential candidate who failed to qualify among the winners in the last democratic debate is trying to excite the American citizens by giving "cash money" gifts, $1,000 a month !!!! .....a very attractive but unethical and unwise tactic in order to gain personal advantage and voters support.....during a presidential campaign....
#####
Quick hypothetical question for the people who are totally against UBI. If Andrew Yang is elected president and his Freedom Dividend goes into effect, will you opt in or out? Just wondering.
#####
Watch, this will be the only question they ask him in EVERY debate. lol
#####
Gave Andrew two questions and the second one was about China!! I'm done with MSNBC and CNN(in the trash along with Fox).
#####
The hero we need. Asian Batman for president!
#####
I feel like the Republicans had a wild card which was Trump. 

Now its Democrats turn and their wild card is Andrew Yang.
Honestly Im pissed of the Democratic debate. The moderators play a dirty ass game.
#####
I hope he has more stipulations for his plan on 1000 a month like you have to work 40 hours a week, be a citizen, etc bc I could quit my job and penny pinch and be happy with 1000k a month
#####
I supported Trump in 2016 but Mr Yang has a better plan for America
#####
This guy needs to go back to china.  Fool
#####
Taking money from the rich to give to the poor is classic communism. In other words a freedom divided is comnunism. Andrew Yang is a communist.
#####
I cant believe Jorge Ramos followed up with a question to try and trip him up that way. I have lost respect for that dude as a journalist. He did not use that demeanor with anyone else throughout the whole debate
#####
I like his UBI. People always say a technological evolution kill a lot of old jobs but bring more better new jobs. But the requirement for the new jobs have became higher and higher in education. For AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and big data, they need the employees have undergraduate degree at least and master and PhD preferred. Unquestionably, UBI can help teenagers and their parents pay the expensive college tuition instead of choosing student loan. What‚Äôs more, it can help pay the medical care. UBI can solve the problems of college education and medical care very well. Some people may argue about the free public college  and medical care for all. Trust me, making public college free must hurt the research-purposed top public universities. They won‚Äôt have enough funding to hire great professors and fund their researches. And that will make more private universities become better, more expensive, and more preferable by the industry employers... for the medical care for all, it is almost impossible... because here is USA
#####
wow so he‚Äôs just gonna give me money??? ü§ù
#####
Jose there, the moderator, is kinda STUPID, isn't he?  'so you're going to get $1K extra a month and spend it all on the taxes, right...?  REALLY? ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID????
#####
NBC show this man more respect because he is our last hope.
#####
Milton Friedman had the same idea. A negative income tax where a basic minimum income was paid to people below a certain Income level. HOWEVER....HOW....EVE...ER! Friedman suggested that AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE WELFARE STATE. It was an efficiency argument. Get RID of welfare, aid to dependent children, medicaid, food stamps, government housing, student loan program, everything. It was a COST REDUCTION program...reducing the "distribution cost" of a bloated federal government dolling out benefits. REPLACE all that with a simple check: free to choose how to spend it. Friedman's point was to REDUCE the federal government dramatically, with the net effect of REDUCING taxes as costs reduced. YANG is suggesting ADDING IT to all existing programs and ADDING taxes to pay for it. PLEASE: do not confuse Yangs STUPID idea with Friedman's Economics Professor-argument about "if you eliminate the bureaucracy and just give people who need it cash, then you are ultimately more efficient at distributing benefits."
#####
Andrew Yang is the guy we need to move this country forward, especially since he seems to be a long term thinker and sees the inetavable. In other words, he's a problem solver who is overqualified for the job.
#####
it‚Äôs a dilemma that if there‚Äôs too many robots; we lose jobs, if manual labour is everything; prices will go up
#####
Wouldn't government giving away money cause inflation, which would cause people to demand even more money from the government?
It would become a vicious cycle.

I think Yang would make an amazing addition to any cabinet but I'm not sold on him as Commander In Chief.
#####
The only two people I like is Bernie free education for public colleges and health care especially for old people who need it.

And then I love this yang guy and who I'd vote for most likely. How is America going to move forward if the people living in the country can't even survive economically.
#####
everyone praising Yang forgot to look at his numbers because he didn't mention the numbers he needs for his plan. 1000 x 300m USD = 300b USD x 12 months = 3.6 trillion per year. The entire US budget is 3-4 trillion per year but you would lose every other program, raise taxes on everyone including the rich (but not enough) and drive the economy to ruin to pay the country 1000$ for 1-2 years (which is how long it can possibly sustain on if every miracle works out)
#####
I'm a republican but if yang makes promises to protect the 2nd amendment and the 1st amendment then he might get my vote
#####
üòÇüòÇ this is hilarious
#####
What Yang means is $ 1000 a month. Plus a hugg from his VP the lady on end of the table who said she will beat Trump with Love. Morons and socialists all. Scary times "yikes"
#####
He wants to tax middle class/blue collar workers.  NOPE, dude.  step off.
#####
Wing Whiner Yang! Shove a bowl of rice in your blow hole already!
#####
You can see pete writing down notes to copy it in his next campaign lol
#####
NBC, Anti ubi, fine. But what‚Äôs your solution for those who lost their jobs to automation? Yes you guys have jobs and don‚Äôt worry about your health insurance and food and your children education cuz you guys are in the elite and your children can go to ivy with no problems, what happened to those who are powerless and are in hunger?
#####
Yang is dreaming.  Funny how these nobodies have a clue how the government is funded and then pays for the many programs for US citizens (including illegals aliens), supplies, government payroll and allots money for foreign interests. Mr. Chicken Fried Rice thinks $3.2 billion for his "free giveaway" annually can easily be funded back into government coffers.  I don't think so!
#####
Andrew Yang has everything planned out. That's why he's gonna win the DNC. He's doing what Trump did in 2016: anticipate the interviewer's questions.
#####
Yang is going to makes all other candidates looks like a child compared to him on Thursday.
#####
*I like Yang as a person. He's an ethical and well-informed individual BUT his political career is unproven and untested. There is only ONE Democratic candidate who has been consistent for decades about his policies. There is only ONE Democratic candidate who has a realistic approach to moving foward to improve Americas middle and working class. Dont need to say his name. **#FEELTHEBERN2020*
#####
I can't decide if this is awesome or the worst mistake in the history of mistakes. Will more big businesses move overseas if this happens? Will our market head into a collapse 10 or 20 years in the future? Will this effect inflation or hurt or help the value of the dollar?
#####
I find it interesting that all other candidates seem to be paying attention and did not intervene. Almost like "ok important person speaking ... shhh"
#####

You really think you're funny, muting his mic? Keep playing.

They're already testing something similar to this idea in the Marshall Islands with their legal tender cryptocurrency the Sovereign.
#####
Universal basic income? How American Mr. Yang.
#####
All the other candidates are so salty you can tell
#####
Maybe if we remove all welfare plans now
#####
It would make it more associated to voters by saying "Big corporates are moving to to automation that replace workers and so increase income inequality while they pay less in tax. Increasing corporate tax based on the size of their automation will substitute the loss of jobs and incomes of American workers.....etc."
#####
According to Ben Shapiro, Yang won this debate
#####
Politicians and even the viewers can learn a lot from this man
#####
No lies, Amazon is getting stronger especially with the prime. He does have a good point, but he forgot to mention people are getting lazy with technology. Real talk he is on point, AI is forever, humans are easy

Ladies and Gentlemen a candidate with pack of innovative and calculated proposals that will make America progress . And the one candidate guaranteed that american not gonna vote for.

Let this man speak
#####
NBC if you don't respect Yang we don't respect you. Karma.
#####
the tragic thing about this is that you just know the dummies are tuning out whenever numbers and amounts are involved and they don't understand what Yang's vision is.
then there's no response to what Yang said as most probably don't even get it and the story moves on to: so what you think about gays, women and climatechange?
#####
Ain't gonna' subscribe to a news organization. But thanks for the highlight on Yang.
#####
Wouldn't government giving away money cause inflation, which would cause people to demand even more money from the government?
It would be a vicious cycle.

This video was longer then all of Andrew Yangs time at all. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Andrew Yang is the only candidate who can take Donald Trumps support. You don‚Äôt pick Yang, you will never win.
#####
I love the answer to America's problems: Tax. Having lived in Europe, VAT was to be avoided at all costs
#####
Yes! Yang 2020!

Andrew Yang is heating up the internet. That's where the real news is at. Only these old timers pay attention to televised news nowadays.

I‚Äôm hooked. I wanted Bernie at first but this dude way better, and he gonna help poor families out too

"How you gonna pay for it?"  -Answer: JEFF BEZOS HAS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  HE HAS SO MUCH MONEY, HE COULDN'T SPEND IT IF HE TRIED AND LIVED TO BE 1000 YEARS OLD.  Meanwhile, we have homeless people on the street, 1/3 of all malls are closing soon,  3 million truckers will be out of work soon, veterans without care, and the Pentagon likes to bomb wedding parties.  I think we could spend our money a tad bit wiser than we are...
#####
MSNBC really screw up this time, I can‚Äôt believe yang only spoke for less than 3 minutes, and guess what ? Maine primary polls just release after the debate, yang is polling at 5% (yang is in 5th place) while the ‚Äúbreak out star‚Äù Harris is polling at 2% (10th place) last place  is o‚Äôrourke at 11th place... now why trump keep saying you guys fake news ? Because everything ‚Äúfor profit‚Äù news media do is questionable... just like Thursday‚Äôs debate... don‚Äôt blame trump & trump supporters calls you fake news because they aren‚Äôt wrong. Anyone that‚Äôs moderate can see the debate are bias...
#####
Nice of you to give him a whole 3 minutes to speak.  He was the ONLY one who stuck to the debate rules.  Harris STOLE his time giving us her sob song about how the poor little black girl was bused so she could get a good education and become a District Attorney and then one day, stand next to an almost 80 year old useless Vice President, and blame him for her lot in life... Next time, MSNBC, if you're going to have debate rules and 10 people on stage, HOLD THEM TO THE TIME FRAMES ALLOTTED, or find some format that doesn't require people to talk so fast no one can follow their complicated, genius ideas to get us out of the economic nightmare most people are actually in.  Rachel is getting $77,000,000 a year to ASK QUESTIONS.  So I assume, are the rest making 'good money' . It'd be nice to hear from the people we haven't heard from before, you think?  DO BETTER, because this thing called the internet is available and we don't need to get our news from you, and gee whiz, what'll happen then? Who will pay you to air hemorrhoid cream commercials, then? We might even stop paying for cable and then Rachel will have to join the soup lines, or at least sell one of her several houses. Poor Rachel.
#####
1:11 - WE ACCIDENTALLY YANG'S MIC
#####
The Democratic party should be ashamed of themselves. Biases left and right. You can even see how they choose which questions to ask which candidates. The question that required more data and used numbers to support the argument was given to Yang (even though he still had the most in-depth answers). 


Sadly, Trump will be in office for another 4 years if Democratic mainstream media continue to play these games. More ammo for Trump to rip on and a divided party in itself. Having a fair debate would help move the country forward but NBC still decides to cheat and insist on immoral grounds.
#####
What a stupid idea lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Ah...the lying con-man Yang, filling the minds of delusional Leftist Lunatics who think that they will get $1000/month.

Trash!!!
#####
Let's give Yang another 10 minutes for no reason just like we did with Biden and Harris. He's the one the people really want to hear right now.
#####
Did they really move all the top comments on his mic being off when this was first posted? Are you kidding me?

Here's what Yang would have said, if these corporate puppets had bothered to actually include him in the debate that he was the first to qualify for.

Both Andrew yang and Marianne Williamson a reporting that they had their mics muted at times during the debate.  I think I'll take the word of two presidential candidates over the DNC and NBC conspired to stop Bernie Sanders last time around.
#####
Listen Andrew fan boys, this is America not socialist land.
#####
I love how they turned off this guys mic because he's smart, The democratic's are doing the same they thing did last time, screwing over everyone that's not part of there idea's. I hope everyone is ready for 4 more years of trump, because ignoring this guy is how you get 4 more years of trump

So he raised his hand for free health care for illegals and open borders?  Get use to waiting in line to see a doctor.

NBC AKA MSNBC hates asians!  They are racist.  They had to ask him about china..... hmmm......

*Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson both confirmed their mics were MUTED MULTIPLE TIMES. They couldn't even interject when they tried.*

Have the Commiecrats drop their campaign to destroy US businesses with a $15 minimum wage & you'll be losing fewer jobs to automation. But, that's why Commies do what they do: destroy businesses, eliminate the middle class, eliminate the US, usher-in their Commie N. American Union. So, they're not going to stop. There are plenty of opportunities out there. Get off your drugs and your pot & go to interviews. In your spare time, read a book: "The 68th Convocation of the Rose & Cross Order." Then, you won't have to be ignorant your entire life. Hard work is the only way you're ever going to get anywhere. The Socialist's magic money tree doesn't exist. The Socialist Utopia doesn't exist. Put on your Yang MATH hat & please explain how people making multiple salaries still live under a poverty line. Working multiple jobs kept me above the poverty line for many years. The slavery dividend helps nothing. It further legitimizes and inflates the Communist Fed's fake, fiat currency scam that's been rammed up our noses for the past century. If you want to see how much people will "benefit," look at Venezuela. If that's your definition of benefit, you can have it.

Very bad moderating and very bad moderators ... the worse of all debate events
#####
Andrew Yang is a joke. His only plan is Universal Basic Income or UBI which is simply an aggregate demand enhancement tool, devised to eradicate the last vestiges of the New Deal. Unlike a Job Guarantee, UBI will not add any capacity to the economy, inflation being its only contribution. Andrew is simply a neo-liberal shill, not a real Democrat like Tulsi, Bernie and Warren.
#####
Andrew is polling higher than some of these candidates, yet he was called on the least of all of them. The establishment Dems don't want an outsider. The American people need one! #HumanityFirst #HumanCenteredCapitalism
#####
Whether or not you agree with Yang's policy proposals, he's one of the few candidates talking about what he'd do for the American people instead of how "mistreated" the border jumpers are.

Yang idea means higher taxes good idea just done want pay for illegals Healthcare and my own people need to get education take up a trade and stop depending because if the government gives you something they will take it away when they decide to so keep that in mind my fellow Americans

Since andrew yang weren't allowed to speak, Marianne Williamson also confirmed this... please view this as andrew yang's debate response instead

I really like him but I hate his gun control position

They muted Andrew Yang's mic. They only let him speak when they talk directly to him, but they let all the other candidates scream as much as possible to get screentime.

EVEN FOX NEWS TREATS HIM BETTER
#####
Literally the ONLY candidate with ideas addressing real issues, meanwhile he got a whole 2 mins while Sanders and Harris shouted about who was the most virtuous politician.
#####
"How would you do that?"
 *blank stare*
 "Sorry?"

 Cringe 100
#####
Good job giving him his token question and then silencing him the rest of the debate.
#####
I bet all the drug addicts would love an extra 1k a month to buy more drugs, and criminals would love the money to buy illegal guns, sounds like a great idea!!!!!
#####
ü§î maybe I'll vote for this guy
#####
Wow! NBC deleted my comment. Now I'm 100% sure they are biased.  I said they cut Yang's mic off so we should cut their revenue off by not watching NBC and those babies deleted the comment.
#####
The Yang Gang will prevail
#####
‚ÄúHow would you do that?‚Äù
Yang: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry ‚Äú. I didn‚Äôt think anyone would ever ask me that ? Haha
#####
I'm not saying I'm voting for him cause he's asian, but thats exactly why I'm voting for him
#####
#LetYangSpeak
#####
Shame on u NBC for giving Andrew least air time!
#####
üñïNBC.
#####
So if their asking where the money will come from to fund his ubi. That means there's no more money to be made. We're all trapped. This the system.We need to take money out the 1% so everyone can live the real definition of free. If we're all against each other we're not for each other. üíØ
#####
The fact that race-related topics such as mass incarceration, police brutality, immigration and welfare were never asked to Andrew Yang, who is apparently Asian and not pandering racial groups, just shows how narrow-minded and ignorant the moderators were. Plus, the debate was truly rigged, out of 2 hours, Andrew Yang only spoke for less than 3 minutes.
#####
Andrew Yang is the only democrat that I would vote for!
#####
What a shifty performance. Embarrassing. GAME OVER.
#####
Yang has solutions, yet we get sound bites from the other candidates just bashing Trump and repeating last election policy ideas.. we need to move forward together not divided. Yang has policies that would directly affect the lives of ever American from all walks of life and regional.. small towns would get big boosts from $1000 a month to its citizens, plus people might be able to purchase a home or keep their home and not go broke during times of uncertainty.. but no.. same old story from the gallery of hacks on the stage.. giving none substance lines with no plans for the future.
#####
His mic was muted though sooo
#####
You guys muted his mic and didnt let him chime in like everyone else got to
#####
The BIG difference between European VAT and American Yang's VAT is Yang's VAT money would go directly to the hands of people.
#####
Either host were bias or they just can‚Äôt understand Andrews policy
#####
Pete checking out Andrew like he A.I
#####
why yall cut off his mic in between segments nbcüò°
#####
I‚Äôm just so freaking happy you exist. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
#####
The most human candidate I've ever seen
#####
I bet the people who randomly bumped into Andrew are like... "why does this guy look so familiar!?"" lol
#####
The feels so real and good! Its like watching the office
#####
A president by the people for the people. Relaxed, laid back and with a strong paln.
#####
I like how he's walking around and no one recognizes him cause it was 6 months ago!! My my how time have changed!
#####
Great idea, Yang as a vlogger!
#####
AY background have dealt with all sort of people for longest of time in his career, rest of candidates spatial/ controlled environ. prolly shallow to say such but the stuff that they fight for aren't really that interesting, same ol' stuff i.e fjg a white elephant or of what? +transparency.... yeah right! etc after another but none really includes within the clause of two way street in counter checks. not often we find someone who says power point presentation and knowing america being straightforward in getting the correct value publicly.
#####
zach professionalism apparent
#####
Stay strong Andrew we need you! 2020
#####
More vlogging!!
#####
I am all for Bernie and don‚Äôt believe in a second choice but by god if I had to go with someone else it would be an easy choice to choose Yang Gang
#####
This does show he is more human than other candidates and knows how to connect with his audience.
#####
WE NEED MORE OF THESE
#####
NYC ....for U .....Mr Andrew
#####
Yang gang 2020 freedom dividend
#####
This guys is the future. America needs to be run by someone modern like President Yang
#####
$1000 Per month for all adult 18+ age  is a way to go and  he will get my vote  and we all will win !
#####
I love him
#####
Go back to  China ..
#####
Chinese government ???????
#####
The next president.
#####
Please come to St. Paul Andrew... my Hmong people is waiting.
#####
We‚Äôre is the money going to come form for a 1,000 a month?
#####

#####
Where's episode 4?!
#####
INDONESIA HAD PAK GUNDUL FOR INDONESIA 2024
#####
Imagine what Bernie‚Äôs schedule looks like
#####
I can bet he won‚Äôt be president.
#####
Watching Yang eating pizza is more interesting than watching other candidate saying something nonsense.
#####
this video is great! Would love to see more of his day to day life. Remember to stay healthy for all of us Andrew.
#####

I saw a recent article on how all of the worlds major banks are buying up all of the worlds aquifer land in what seems to be an attempt to control the world water supply. Would be very interested to hear Yang's opinion on this development.

Not the hero we deserve,  but oh man do we ever need him!

Vlogging is a great idea.
#####
If you‚Äôre reading this, PLEASE do as much as you can to support Yang. If he gets the nomination, there‚Äôs no way he won‚Äôt win the presidency.
#####
Just a normal guy doing normal things, trying to save the world
#####
this guy will stand out with the younger crowd
#####
As Asian american, I know it wont be easy but your step is significant and hope you get the result you seek
#####
Lol I like how at the time he was able to just walk around freely without gaining attention. Little did everyone know he was running for president.
#####
This is so refreshing!! More of this! This is so authentically vulnerable and real!! üíöüôåüèªüòÉ

This is a great idea! Please keep uploading.

I just explained to my gf that Andrew Yang will bring our country into the modern day, while also preparing us for the near future with the freedom dividend. it‚Äôs clear and there‚Äôs no other way to put it, he is the path forward!
#####
oh my god I worked at chipotle AND blaze pizza hahaha I was already YANGGANG but this cemented it!

The 46 people that disliked just hate chocolate covered espresso bean.
#####
This little racist of color (Yang) hasn't been able to provide a concrete information about his big spending plans.  He talks about a vat tax which would be passed on to consumers by businesses.  None of this economic plans make sense.  The $1000 a month can't be done.   He will say anything to get votes.  We also need to remember he is Chinese therefore he will put Chinese interests first.
#####
Not sure if it's intentional or what but "Yang Gang" literally means "masculinity" in Mandarin Chinese
#####
I bet trump campaign is going Mexican restaurant telling them to pay for wall
#####
Anyone knows how tall he is?  He looks pretty tall.
#####
"Shouldn't of given him am espresso bean"..... lol
#####
I heard Yang is going to announce he is ending his campaign and endorsing Trump.
#####
He need to put a book out to advertise himself as what Obama did to his campaign before he become a President...
#####
forget it. sorry but realistically, the US is racist so he won't win. took the US  a long time to vote for a black guy to be in the office, so what are the chances for an asian to win??!!
#####
This is great! How down to earth Yang is...so trustworthy !
#####
Legend in the making
#####
This guy is so underrated. I‚Äôve never voted before, but this guy has my vote!
#####
Debates are the most important thing, so sad the thinking cuz it‚Äôs such a bad forum, o well
#####
it's fascinating watching a man's psyche change throughout a presidential campaign
#####
Mr. good job I like the way you respond  
That‚Äôs  our. Future. 2020
Good luck  take care
#####
Can we just elect this man now?
#####
If i ever saw this man i would give him a firm handshake and a hug he‚Äôs so down to earth and genuine.
#####
This man vlogs too, I fuckin love it
#####
Andrew every time I listen to you I learn something new or many new things. Much love and support from canada
#####
#DailyYang reminds me of #DailyVee
#####
who's house is that...Wow he's down to earth.. staying in a regular American house .. not a mansion , Presidential suite at local hotel . interesting
#####
Yang needs T-shirts with all his policies on back,So when your standing in line people can see what he's policies are about.(Advertisement)
#####
Dont worry you will go from that house. To The White House .
#####
how about immigrants
#####
Promise, promise : illusion !!!
#####
I got to say I like how he's talking more about America's financial issues than so-called left and right moral issues he doesn't seem to be as concernedwith how people act or what they think is wrong and right but more so what they need to get their lives in order.
#####
yang said he it really disappointing there is not more people of color on the communist democrat stage because the commie bastard loves identity politics.... the piece of sh-t commie can rot in hell
#####
the communists always do a great job at distributing everyones work efforts for the greater good ....... commie yang will ensure we are all equal like in venezuela and be part of the one world govt
#####
What has happened to American ‚ÄúCan-do‚Äù spirit? Why is UBI a pipe dream? JFK wanted us to go to moon and we did it despite many initial set backs in rocketry. We came up with 4 billions dollars to save the banks and the country from depression so we should be able to come up with the money to deal with up coming massive job loss. The government just have to distribute the fund and time-honored American ingenuity knows best to rescue and grow our economy.
#####
His plan sounds sound. Yang 2020.

Read this book.

https://www.amazon.com/Welfare-Trait-Benefits-Affect-Personality-ebook/dp/B01860E27C

The welfare state has a problem: each generation living under its protection has lower work motivation than the previous one.
#####
That is not how a VAT works.

Please watch the video and pay close attention to who ends up paying the taxes in the end.

Hint: Its you.

‚ÄúAmazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,‚Äù said an Amazon spokeswoman, Jodi Seth, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe have invested more than $160 billion in the U.S. since 2011, building a network of more than 125 fulfillment and sortation centers, air hubs and delivery stations as well as cloud-computing infrastructure and wind and solar farms.‚Äù

Yang is not a serial entrepreneur, which is by definition an entrepreneur who continuously comes up with new ideas and starts new businesses. 

Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a small business. 

The people who create these businesses are called entrepreneurs. 

Yang has personally created two businesses. 

2.

Stargiving.com ( a failure) and Venture for America.

Yang is a typical entrepreneur, who has twice come up with an idea, started a company, then seen it through and played an important role in the day-to-day functioning of said company.

The rest of the time Yang was an employee.

EMPLOYEE:
1999 corporate attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 

ENTREPRENEUR:
2000 launches a start-up Stargiving.com, which folded in 2001.¬† 

EMPLOYEE:
Yang joined a healthcare software startup MMF Systems, Inc., as its Vice President and third hire. 

EMPLOYEE:
2005 joined friend Zeke Vanderhoek at a small test preparation company, Manhattan Prep.

EMPLOYEE:
2006 becomes CEO of Manhattan Prep.
2009 Manhattan prep acquired by Kaplan.

ENTREPRENEUR:
2011 Founded Venture for America.
2017 Stepped down as CEO.

November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for President of the United States in 2020.

So in all honesty Yang has 12 years of entrepreneurial experience spread over two companies, one of which was a failure.

In contrast a serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people.

Yang.¬† You just need to start one more business to earn the bragging rights of Serial Entrepreneur.

Until then give it up.

Bernie and Warren are so basic. Yang is coming up quickly.

I don't like that I will have to pay the VAT....  it would be better if the loopholes for the rich will be closed so they don't escape paying taxes... As well as the other corrections I posted in my second comment
#####
Mr.  Yang.  I am confused about where the money for the UBI will come from...  Could you explain it once again?  Some sources say that a "value added on tax" will be on everything I purchase! Tell me this is wrong!  I thought that the ultimate rich were going to pay for the UBI?  Wasn't this your original statement?  If the loopholes for the rich become closed, end sanctuarycities, end daca,  end tax payer funded abortions, and end giving billions of dollars to illegals and other foreign countries then the UBI will work.  I've told POTUS45 that we should also purchase land with apartment style buildings and allow our poor to live there free. After that ask the rich and middle class to donate to help strengthen the community. PS: legal immigrants are awesome!  But the illegals are taking jobs, welfare and receive stipends from our gov for edu.,  and other help!  But where is the help for the legal law-abiding American citizens? ....UBI is great.....  But where is the money going to come from? Are you going to tack more taxes on products we purchase? I truly hope not as things are already expensive... Thanks

a re-heated version of communism. the only difference is. an asian is pushing for it now

#####
This guy is an idiot. I cant believe this idea is getting so much support. If you give people "free" money they do not work harder, it will only promote laziness. I put free in quotes because it is not free, the American people will pay for it in taxes, inflation or cost of living. This is an idea that sounds good in theory (again partly cause its "free") but is mathematically impossible, even according to his own completely fabricated numbers.  Am I alone on this  or did I miss how this fantasy system is even remotely realistic in practice?
#####
VAT or sales tax is actually tax to consumer or end users not Amazon as the seller, unless they are forced to not increase their price and absorb the VAT, plus the way VAT work for company is there are VAT incoming and outgoing which can be cancel out every month when we reporting our taxes. I know because in Indonesia we have been using this for a long time
#####
$12,000.00 ain't no money when you compare the spectacularly enormous profits corporate America rakes in just quarterly!
#####
"If you want genuine trials, you have to go bigger."  It's time for bigger.  Thank you, Fortune, for a good interview and for showing that this can be done.
#####
What about Social Security?  Will recipients receive the $1,000 per month or have to forgo one for the other?
#####
All lies.. all lies üëø
#####
Great! So the tech billionaires and top 1%ers, like Musk and Zuckerberg, are advocating for UBI. So Can anyone tell me, Exactly how much $$ out of their corporate coffers-- specifically Tesla's and Facebook's-- will be funneled out of their massive cash reserves, and fed into the UBI program to come up with the $3.8 trillion needed to fund the program for the first year alone?..... Hmm, That's what I thought. Unless the top 1%ers who have automated working-class people out of their jobs,  provide continual funding to sustain the UBI program, then UBI is not going to work. The bottom 90% of this country should not be burdened with having to pay any taxes whatsoever in order to benefit. So what do you all think of UBI now?
#####
I don‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt work. We have used credit to drive are economy for along time. Why not have basic income drive it.
#####
I‚Äôm conservative but believe yang is the best candidate and would vote for him.
#####
Awesome segment! Love the visuals too. Thanks, Fortune!
#####
Extra 1000 sounds good
#####
Just donated to his campaign
#####
Ubi is such a great idea. Lets be the first country to make it happenüëç
#####
I'm a republican and I hope this man gets elected.
#####
Another question. If it's for life, then what happens with social security? Shouldn't it end once social security benefits start. Same with disability and welfare. ü§î I think this will cause more problems. Plus, the flood of immigrants. Will they qualify as well? The problem is, our government is out of control. The more they spend, the more they borrow. That's the real cause of inflation. Plus, the government doesn't produce a product to sell at a profit or to break even for that matter. So by doing this, we raise the overhead of all commerce. Then chase them away to another country. That's a good idea. üôÑ
#####
The only candidate Americans ought to vote as their president.  Smart, level headed and seems like a nice person, based on his domestic and foreign policies.  The only candidate and president worth following and supporting.
#####
UBI does lead to inflation because Yang plan‚Äôs to increase taxes on corporations.  Yang is not talking about the MMT or the GOP tax reforms *cough cough CUTS that Don the con gave to the rich and corporations which are paid for by printing money.  

By the way trump‚Äôs tax cuts are not inflationary (yet) because the gave no economic benefit to the economy especially working man.  The corporations just bought back stocks in order to lower the price earnings ratio of the company.  That way officers of the company could make their bonus money.
#####
Fortune magazine taking Yang Seriously wow.  Even if he does not win Andrew‚Äôs ideas will resonate like Bernie‚Äôs ideas for 2024.
#####
I like yang his ideas are actually alot deeper then just the ubi which is great by itself.
#####
Doesnt sound like it would affect supply and demand at all..............
#####
Andrew Yang is making history.
#####
Translated that they wake up to the reality that cash makes people's lives better. Really means, in layman's terms in a very nice way to put it, they have to accept it and stop being selfishly greedy.
#####
And no one thinks that by giving EVERYONE an extra $1000 that landlords won't just increase rent as well? Not to mention how over populated the housing/renter market will be, plus how fast inflation on other products is going to go up. Come on guys, think.
#####
I like this guy but he is more dangerous too the establishment than Trump. No way he will be the democrat candidate, shame because he is exactly whats needed
#####
I'm hoping that is true, your not  lying to us.
#####
Love your country, love your families, love your neighbors, and love yourself by voting and supporting for Yang into the White House in 2020. Please donate and raise your voice.
#####
Before you call Yang a Socialist or Commie, first off, a entrepreneur is the least likely to be a socialist/communist. The people who you should call a commie/socialist is politicians, mostly the established, trade unionists and the worker.
#####
They cut yangs mic!!! He‚Äôs a threat. I know it and everyone else knows it. Let‚Äôs go Yang!!!
#####
Wang doesn't understand human beings and how dependency rots us from the inside out.  UBI would be as catastrophic to our society as welfare has been.

Sounds like a great idea if only he would team up with Tulsi Gabbard The Two of them could really make a difference!
#####
Fantastic interview. Yang has my vote!
#####

#####
best candidate ever!
#####
Quick hypothetical question for the people who are totally against UBI. If Andrew Yang is elected president and his Freedom Dividend goes into effect, will you opt in or out? Just wondering.
#####
UBI can‚Äôt work, but I like Yang as a person
#####
Or you could start making Amazon pay taxes.
#####
there are 85k views on this vid obviously hes not waking waves. Try again in 30 years yang fans.
#####
wouldn't the tech companies move to other countries to bypass this vat tax?
#####
Lol this is the yang gang btw #yanggang2020 if your a trump supporter you have no business with us do to the fact we will jump on yo ass.YANG GANG ONLY!!! üëåüëåüëåüôå

The Freedom Dividend is NOT a social welfare program.  It is a Dividend.  It is a tiny slice of every google search, every Amazon sale, every Facebook ad.  $1000 per month is a foundation that can be built upon, because it is not means tested, and it is not taken away if we use it to improve our financial situation (which is what happens with food stamps and other welfare programs).  Please, stop calling the Freedom Dividend a social welfare program.  It's an injection of money into our economy that helps families, businesses, and even the environment.
#####
Yang gang 2020
#####
I am running for president for the United States and I will give every month for every American citizen $2,000
#####
I fear you might see a massive increase in drug overdoses with this...
#####
Can someone well-versed in economics explain to me how a VAT could  support the UBI? VAT is a tax the customer pays on top of the price of the product, so doesn't that make things more expensive?
#####
Ehh. 

No welfare but UBI. Welfare ends up costing a ton to run
#####
he seems so genuine
#####
I'm surprised America doesn't even have VAT. It's the norm here in Europe
#####
Wouldn't government giving away money cause inflation, which would cause people to demand even more money from the government?
It would become a vicious cycle.
#####
SORRY YANG FANS, His number 1 idea will NEVER FLY. It may be a good idea. Doesn't matter. GIVING away money doesn't fly. And if your number 1 idea won't fly, nobody wants to hear idea number 2. He will be out real fast.
#####
You crushing it Andrew! #YANGGANG!
#####
YANG GANG 2020
#####
Mute the Champ Champ mic off heelll nawww!!
#####
He is for Medicare For All full stop and UBI! Nice!!!!
#####
Buying votes with a promise of free money. Only an idiot believes you will actually get it.
#####
I see people getting 1000 dollars a month and spending it on things from Amazon and not the malls and local stores.  It's not about the money, it's about the priority and nobody cares enough about local businesses in the end.  This will basically take money from rich/upper middle/middle class people and funnel it back to Amazon through everyone.
#####
I just bought some of his merch. "Secure the bag" tote bag and "Yang Gang" t-shirt lol. Love this man so much! Yang2020 !!
#####
It‚Äôs as simple as 1, 2 and 3. Andrew Yang win, all of America win, why? Because Andrew is by the people for the people 24/7. ‚ù§Ô∏è
#####
That's horrible idea. Why don't Yang give 1k a month for people who work that will encourage people to find a job and keep it.
#####
Yang is the president version of ELON MUSK
#####
But like me in california everytime we get a raise of income the landlords and other utilities financially rape the citizens and thats what I want to find out if it will take more then we get.....js
#####
Andrew is definitely my favorite candidate for 2020!
#####
Andrew 2020
#####
The only Demtard I would vote over trump is yang other then that trump will win again because the elites in the Demtard party have no clue of the real world with exception of trump and yang I figure the Asian guy is smarter then the white guy

Answer at 1:45
#####
There should be no 'tie' to people who receive social security. That is not welfare that is a program that hard working people have paid into their entire lives and wait till late in life for the return. He needs to make very clear the "kinds" of benefits people would lose. Not fair to give a millionaire a 1000 dollars a month but not a single mother who wants to keep her food stamps. There should be no "catch."
#####
Real question here:  Did Value Added Tax work in the UK?  Can I get a kind Brit to help me with with question?  My view when I visited was all products were around 15 percent more than any where else in the world sans exchange rate.  Since I was a tourist, I really want to skip the bias I had and just looking for an honest answer.  TIA & all the best.
#####
He didn‚Äôt speak much at the debate and whether or not it was due to his ‚Äúmic being shut off‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter. When he did speak it was absolute cringe and shows he knows jack shit about how we‚Äôre going to pay for ubi. Furthermore he wants to provide illegal immigrants with free healthcare. Let‚Äôs go ahead and toss this #YangGangBang horseshit in the dustbin of history.
#####
The thing is, Yang's UBI actually needs Bernie Sanders' social democracy agenda for the numbers to add up. Yang talks about instituting a VAT tax similar to the EU's, which he says would raise about 800 billion dollars per year and would fund UBI. The problem is that if you run the numbers, providing $1K per month for every US adult would take more like three trillion dollars per year. There seems to be an unspoken subtext in Yang's argument that we would need to gut the existing social safety net (especially Social Security) in order to fund UBI, something that other countries that have looked into UBI (e.g. Switzerland) also discovered, and balked at.

However, if Sanders style social democracy were to be implemented, UBI could actually be paid for without touching our existing social safety net. For instance, I recently saw an economist point out that a $15 minimum wage (Yang opposes a minimum wage increase, btw) would generate 400 billion dollars per year in new tax revenue. Added to Yang's VAT, this takes the funding for UBI up to 1.2 trillion. Now, as Bernie likes to point out, the United States currently spends about 18 percent of its total GDP on healthcare, whereas countries with single payer healthcare spend, on average, 11 percent of GDP on their health systems. Moving to single payer would free up seven percent of US GDP. This would pay for most of the gap between 1.2 trillion and 3 trillion for UBI. If we cut out subsidies to oil and gas companies (meaning that, yes, we'd pay a higher price at the pump for gas, but we need to move to electric cars anyway) we could easily make up the rest of the difference.

On the other hand, for free college tuition to truly liberate college students from financial obligations, fulltime students need to be on UBI. This would free college students from having to work through college so that they can concentrate on their studies.

Yang's ideas and Sanders' ideas need each other.
#####
Go get 'em Andrew. Rational answers for real problems, not foaming at the mouth xenophobic BS.

If he gives me 1000 a month, I'll invest it in wall street and big tech.

#####
disgusting how the left is treating yang but fox actually covers him. dnc doing the same stupid thing
#####
if this woman just said she's not an economist she's not running for president she doesn't know how to fix any issues why did she always have to have the last word anything that Andrew Yang says she has like 10 rebuttals before she moves on to the next question she rebuts it and puts out into his argument before changing the subject what's the name of that tactic?
#####
I'm a Democrat, but if he were running as a Republican, I'd switch parties in a heartbeat to vote for this guy. He's the one we need.
#####
This is the best content I've seen on Fox News, usually their content is so biased but this reporter gives the interviewee a fair shake.
#####
Why the hell are the democrats picking Biden and Warren over Yang? I just cannot comprehend this party
#####
Excellent questioning by the interviewer!
#####
As recent as 4 months ago, Yang was being described as a fringe candidate. And now, he's drawing bigger and bigger crowds and financial support. He's dominating social media despite being snubbed by MSM. 
       Yang has singlehandedly upped the level of political, social, and economic discourse in this campaign. And he is getting a lot of attention and respect overseas. 
     He  is already changing the US and the rest of the world for the better.
#####
Makes people happier and healthier,  oh no the horror!!! Fox is stupid  af
#####
The doctors that ARE worried about "not getting those reimbursements rates" should not be even be doctors.
#####
That host is HOT AF!!!
#####
Soo if your a big company and make a lot of money you have to pay more that makes no sense, that‚Äôs like saying if you become too successful than you‚Äôre gonna have to pay even more than if you were not successful I would think everyone should pay the same and we shouldn‚Äôt have to tax the people who make money for the people who don‚Äôt.
#####
Notice the lack of criticism on any polices that Andrew Yang creates.
#####
How do you sell 1000 a month!? what's there to sell?
#####
Seems a reasonable person, I suspect voters will turn away 1G per month if implemented.
#####
So glad Fox acknowledges a man that speaks solutions regardless of party. He continuously speaks against blaming one person or one party for the nation's problems. The country needs someone like this.
#####
Yang does best in longer interviews where he can really flesh out his ideas. Check out the Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan interviews
#####
You can tell she was totally engaged towards the end.
#####
His mouth is a machine gun of facts.
#####
Andrew reunites Americans and Chinese and the world! He has the foresight and intelligence!
#####
I‚Äôm proud of everyone here for not making his race an issue. Surprising in a good way.

She asked him who was going to pay for it and he immediately attacked successful businesses. 

That is what socialists do.

#####
The price of living will adjust within 12 months, your extra 12000 dollars will buy you the same , it‚Äôs what happens in every country every year , come on Andrew , do the numbers
#####
America has no better choices than @. He is the only one and the best one to be able to bring this country FORWARD. Let's put this man into the White House in 2020.
#####
The question is what makes he think his interest in idea/opinion/plan will certain to work without devastating negative ripple effects?
#####
You get $1000, Yang you get $1000, Yang you too get $1000, Yang everyone gets $1000!!!
#####
It's sad when the only media outlets that will give a reasonable democrat the time of day are either moderate or conservative.  MSNBC & CNN can't be bothered to have him on.
#####
HE WONT WIN, know why? Cause he Asian and White corporate America wont let it happen. NEVER.
#####
Geez weez, here's a thought, what if Machines, robots and AI take so many jobs that we JUST DONT HAVE enough for everyone? What are we gonna do with those people? Make them do low wage social work that society DESPERATELY need but NOBODY wants to do because they dont have 1K per month to live on? oh wait.........
#####
Should be paid for by the Clinton Foundation!
#####
Only in america "they didn't work more but they were heather and happier" is something that is crazy
#####
This independent voter finally has someone to vote for. Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
Wow!  Razor sharp intellect and knows how to solve America's problems.  Freedom Dividend will unite Americans.  Make Andrew Yang your president.
#####
I really like his plans but it seems very directly naive because the big corporations will intellectually find a way resist his innovative ideas. Eventually his plans will most likely delay then ultimately fail which will create a huge disgrace mark in the Asian history.
#####
i have been poor before, $1000 is a life line, most people will still need work, $1000 isnt enough to support a family, but an extra $1000 will help tremendously in terms of medicare, home repairs, utilities...
#####
I'm disagreed with his universal basic income policy, but I have huge respect on him! He just try to solve problem. Unlike Democrats Career Politicians.
#####
very good interviewer. listened to what he had to say, asked the right questions to test policy and didnt interrupt
#####
America.  Please Watch his interview with Joe Rogan. This man is the real deal! For all Americans.
#####
Its easy to say...
#####
Yang's is for America
#####
Why we bail out the rich
#####
Bail out car companies ot home owners  we choose car companies
#####
We loss home for the car companies
#####
Why doesn't anyone ever state that having a working health care system keeps people healthy and actually prevents cumulating health care costs.

Yes, America is a very unique country when it comes to innovation but if you look at history many cultures have been innovative, Especially during times of war.  Both America and Germany were extremely innovative during WW2 but at what cost?  None of the innovations made were worth the pain and suffering that they (the governments) inflicted on others nor was it worth the pain and suffering that they inflicted on their own citizens.  


About the investors of Big Tech; Maybe once we've all received a Freedom Dividend the bottom 90 percent of american households can buy Google, Facebook, and Uber stocks.  Then Big Tech won't have to depend on their few mega investors.  84% percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households.  It may make more sense if Big Tech was more like a crowd funded company and a small dollar donation funded politician.  


We can't trust politicians whom receive corporate donations and we can't trust major corporations whom don't listen to the people.  There are pros and cons to being a publicly traded company but there are no cons when it comes to integrity with being a small dollar funded politician.  The only con is if a corrupt candidate can purchase more commercials, flyers, etc than the small dollar funded candidate. And is successful in brainwashing enough americans to side with them and not with the small dollar funded candidate.  


That means that we in the bottom 90% *must* support these populist small dollar funded candidates.  Andrew Yang is a small dollar funded candidate.  We can trust him far more than any corporate funded president from 1976 onward.  


Ever wonder why every president has failed us?  It's because of money in politics.  


"Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), is a U.S. constitutional law Supreme Court case on campaign finance. A majority of judges held that limits on election spending in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 ¬ß608 are unconstitutional."  


Corporations are not people.  They shouldn't be able to buy our politicians.  Progressives and Libertarians need to support Yang for the betterment of our society.  People on both sides need to stop being purest and support the candidate that is focused on helping *all* americans.  Yes, Even the billionaires.  Even they will see the benefit of the Freedom Dividend when their customer base skyrockets.  


My fellow americans, Lets secure our nation, economy, and our country's sanity by securing our bag. :)

So all his policies promote humanity first and the economy exists to serve the people....His Freedom Dividend will force the economy to serve the people like he said...If these 3 things happened, United States will become the greatest civilization on Earth.

My husband is Taiwanese and I like Yang; however... this is my opinion about him.  He is promising us the sun and the moon; 73 or more promises that will require Congressional approval.  You can rest assure that the border will remain wide open and there will be even a greater rush across the border to get the promised free money with no strings attached; regardless of what he says about citizenship.  Look at how much corruption there is with welfare.  There's a lot more I could say.  If it's too good to be true; it probably is and that's my honest assessment.

Andrew Yang has my vote!!!!

It sucks that I sort of accidentally found this channel and it for some reason didn't show up top when I've been searching for Andrew Yang content. Admittedly my search methods are suuuper old person-y and I didn't use filters or anything and I'm not the smartest in the bunch but still.
#####
So is this an endorsement from this mayor
#####
Andrew Yang is your guy worthy of the White House.  He will solve your problems.  Make him your president.
#####
Let's just make Andrew Yang president now and call it a day!¬†

If Andrew Yang doesn't become president we are fucked!  There are no candidates that are recognizing the real potential problems with right out of the gate ready to implement real solutions for all of our concerns. No one is running as comprehensive a campaign relying on a "Humanity First" platform. No one is recognizing that our GDP measurements lack the empathy that our nation needs that would reflect what is really happening with our nation. Tell all your friends and Vote Yang 2020.  Let's do this for us.

I just watched his interview in Fox. He just lets Laura talk and talk. He did not know how to take control. His $1000/month idea for homeless is really bad. He is Chinese-American. He should know Chinese Says: "Teaching fishing instead of giving fish". He has no chance. I am a Chinese-American too, but you will not get my vote.

I see he‚Äôs hitting ever spot and venue throughout the country and I believe that‚Äôs what gonna give him the presidency really out for the people yang gang rising for 2020 in droves

LOL. That stair clip at 1:19 is so priceless and representative. Andrew takes a challenge, an insult, and an encouragement--but if it doesn't take him any closer to his goal, he'll just "fk that" and get back on track towards the final destination! XD

Yang, I know you have a lot of policies going around, Can you make it apparent in one of your policies for stricter laws against animal cruelty please. Because our pets are not just our animals...its our family. People please thumbs up if you agree so hopefully Yang will see this.
#####
Wow, this man is genuine AF.  So down-to-earth and real.  Willing to interact with ordinary folk and get to know them on a personal level.  Respect.
#####
Yang wasn't invited to the MoveOn Candidate Forum happening June 1st. Five major Democratic candidates have confirmed their attendance. THIS IS A BFD. Please sign this petition.
The MoveOn Forum, a progressive grassroots organization, has invited Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O‚ÄôRourke, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Juli√°n Castro to attend and take part in a forum to, " individually to pitch 'one big idea' that‚Äôs central to their candidacy and moderators will ask follow-up questions for about 20 minutes." Already, Gillibrand, Harris, Sanders, and Warren have confirmed their attendance. To say the least, THIS IS A BFD. It will be televised. A petition has been started to get Andrew Yang on the stage, but we have a little over a week before the event. The link to the petition is this:

Okay but how did he do that arm trick

I think Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are the best candidates running so far, even better than Sanders.

Many US cities and towns have rivers running through their centers. There are versions of hydro generators that can tap energy from a river without damming it. Yang could adopt a financial incentive policy to revive town centers by subsidizing the building of river generators in town centers and provide discount electricity to existing or startup businesses, e-cars, etc. The Mill Works Again Initiative.

Running on the premise of Yang "Gang" , "freedom dividend" Ubi using Martin Luther King to champion the  phrase the black culture is spicing your campaign up inadvertently yet you won't give us more frequency to tune in you motherf*cker yang you better send us better signals these white folks ain't got charisma their wavelengths are so small using white media to get your message out vs using the black voice is like comparing 3g to 4g it's too slow MF
#####
See Yang this exactly what I was saying the black dude in the video hasn't even caught wind of.you yet you not tapping in with the black community will be your biggest failure we got bill Maher and Stephen Colbert on the month of primaries which is good but black n Mexican audiences don't rly watch either of those but no black media co signs still maybe u did the breakfast club a little too early or maybe you should pull a miracle and do it one more time before the debates begin idk but ey I'm still doing my part tryin to rustle the community up but they ain't interested unless they see another familiar face and it's sad but they still dont know I think you should have went to Wilder fight and asked to speak with Wilder he's a good loud voice with good intentions but so much I see you NOT doing to get the black community on board and I for one am not gonna have that we gonna do our part but Yang you gotta do yours too.


 you need the black vote that will get you the Hispanic vote immediately too ZACH YANG GET IT TOGETHER NOW

Bring pro abortion is not forward
#####
is anyone gonna talk about the fact that Jimmy Kimmel Disrespected Andrew on national tv !
#####
3:51 I think Andrew overestimates how much Republicans care about their constituents. They are there to serve big money interests and throw their constituents the occasional bone on abortion or something. If Yang is serious making any changes that will threaten the wealthy's influence over politics, the Republicans (and corporate Democrats) will oppose him at every turn.
#####
I am  not an American (I am Swedish), but I find it incredibly interesting to follow how Andrew's ideas gains more and more of a foothold in the general public. Feels like the US is really ready for a new way of managing their finances. Hope you all can lead the way by making brave choices!
Good luck!!
#####
Loving at least what's on your policies so refreshing to hear a politician say I have a 12 point plan just go check my website and it not just be them saying I have a 12 point plan.

After reading some of your policy proposals I have to ask how much of a heinlein fan are you?

Andrew Yang - More eye contact with the people you are speaking with. Males have a tendency to be more at ease speaking side-by-side, as women like to speak face to face. It comes off cold and disengaging, however, to avoid eye contact. Furthermore, the young man leaving the coffee shop was an opportunity (for your campaign, if not just this video) to stand with him, introduce yourself, and invite him to your party. He was more than willing to hype you up, and you let a, albeit small, but pivotal moment pass you. In your, what seemed laser-like focus on "getting there", or paying attention to people who knew you, you missed an opportunity to expand your movement.

I will vote for you in the primaries, I talk about you and have read your book. I have watched countless interviews. These are subtle yet nuanced changes I believe will help you... that's if you actually read anything from the grassroots, however. haha.

YangGang2020!
#####
....Andrew Yang has created a Dizzying list of more than 100+ policies !!!!,....and the number is growing and growing....hundreds by 2020....? ;  among those policies are medicare for all, the UBI, the paid family leave, $100 vouchers for all Americans to donate to nonprofits, reviving earmarks to make bills easier to pass, hiring a White House psychologist, legal marijuana, geoengineering to fight global warming, etc ...etc....etc...some of his policies seem to be grounded in Math. and data....
Andrew Yang began his Presidential Campaign on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic Primaries. 
Yang says his campaign is about facts, solutions, and people....but the real fact is that ...after "18 months" of Presidential Campaign....!, his great Town Halls, interviews, rallies, speeches, after so much Media attention, there is no doubt Yang has become a very well known presidential candidate these days...but now on May 2019, he averages "only" 0 to 1 percent in Nationwide Public Opinion Polls....
Andrew Yang has no shortage of things to talk about, he dreams Big !!!!....but Political History, Reality, and Pragmatism have always shown us that Math. and good intentions not always give such a huge number of ideas and policies the chance of being carried out and accomplished successfully for so many reasons.... they become very often a fiction novel, not a real platform.......

..." Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be "..... ( A. Einstein ).
#####
Might sound clich√© but you're really giving me hope in humanity, Andrew. 

You also determined me to go into politics myself after finishing my education. 
People who are empathic and stand for human dignity, whatever biographical details may have led to that ability, have a responsibility to step forward in the public arens instead of living lives as passive bystanders, leaving the stage to the more radical persons


Although salient examples may seem almost unreachable, still, many may find out that they have more to offer than they believe, once they make the first step into activity

To anyone from the Gang reading this: check out Paul Mason and his view on humanity, there's definitely a lot of intersection between his views and Yang's 

If there's a question you would pose to Paul Mason, what would you ask, related to Andrew Yang? 
A friend of mine is gonna be interviewing him soon
#####
Out of the people who have heard of him, yang's favorability is underwater. He's one of the few Dem candidates in any tier that has a higher unfavorable score than favorable score, according to the recent Monmouth poll.

You are the only sane, forward thinking candidate we Americans have.
P.S. Don't forget about us disabled people!

"We need to have some affirmative bold vision thats unlikely to emanate from someone who has been in office for a perticular period of time." My thoughts exactly Yang>Bernie>Warren>Beto>Biden

I can't wait for Andrew Yang to become President.
#####
Yang is so calm and collected and positive. I wish I had a fraction of that.
#####
I see TWO President Andrews...
#####
Love this peek into the day to day! More please!
#####
I was there! At 3:39. Andrew Yang is the real deal! If you get a chance to see him in your town, you MUST go. If you don't like him after, that's fine. But it's absolutely worthwhile to see him in person. He is very friendly and he sticks around after the fact to meet everyone that wants to meet him.
#####
Yang has my vote üòÄ

I NEED MOAR ANDREW YANG CONTENT! I GOOGLE ANDREW YANG EVERY DUY! YANG CONTENT IS MY OPIOID CRISIS! YANG CONTENT IS LIKE A CLAW VACUUM SUCKING THE TIME OUT OF MY LIFE!

Andrew Yang and Co., you should contact Lil Nas X. He is one of the most popular rappers right now. You should work with him to make a track about your campaign.

So amped for this man.

Yang is so epic

I'm one of the people in the crowd at 3:39! So amazing meeting Mr. Yang. I told him he'd become my 2020 candidate and we bro-hugged. Best moment of the year!

Its so great to have these videos that is not the rally speech or same repeating questions from interviewers.
Makes Andrew Yang seem more real and grounded than any other candidate running.
(2:13) "It should be a club again, This is my Presidential Decree."

HE IS THE ONLY NORMAL PERSON IN THE CAMPAIGNS.... MOST NATURAL! HE HAS TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE!

HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO GENUINELY CARES ABOUT HIS PEOPLE.. AMERICANS

#####
Excuse my language but I fucking love this guy so much. What an incredible human that is trying to lift humanity.
#####
How can I help Andrew??? I will donate my time for your campaign
#####
I'm  an unproven  entrepreneur because  I don't  have the money  to get my inventions going. These are jobs that are not in our economy.  If tbis is part of my story, how many  other people  are there like me that can use $1,000 a month to help themselves help others and help this economy. 
 I am voting g for Andrew Yang.  First of all because Andrew Yang has done the math he has done research he's done his homework and he has answers to solve the problems of the 21st Century.
Problems that got  Donald Trump elected President of the United States. Problems to cut  the ridiculous rising cost of Education. Problems to cut the rising cost of prescription drugs, medical cost insurance cost, housing cost. If you name it , Andrew Yang and his numbers gurus have probably already ran the numbers and have the answers  facing  America today.   So America are you ready to break away from the left and the right bought and failed policies that are splitting and ripping America apart like a sinking ship ready to go down. America are you ready to have your dreams come true .Then if you answered  yes, and yes. Vote Andrew Yang  President  of the United States in 2020.
#####
The Marvel DC comment just did it for me . He's not faking ü§≠ü§≠. 
Kidding .. he's so humanely Presidential..
#####
Dnc needs to put people the first and earns the grassroots trust. Only Yang can do it.
#####
Have any other candidates done things like this to show their policies will have a positive effect on American families? I'm not trying to debate, I'm genuinely curious.
#####
Hell, Yang  might be the first candidate actually worth voting for..
#####
I love that he truly cares for people when he started to tear up a little when talking about how people are value at nothing.

Wow.

As of 10/28, there were 28 people who disliked this story.  What sort of bitter/jealous/petty person dislikes a fantastic story like this?  SMH

Funny how this is front news when trump has been doing this long before he ever ran and still does it today but this billionaire is a saintly for doing the same thing why trump is hated double standards all the way
#####
Andrew yang is my hero; he‚Äôs more than a true American and a real American story. He as a minority and then of course a model minority as a chinese American, he did all that‚Äôs possible against all odds to make America a better place!
#####
Damn it...where the hell are these hidden ninjas cutting these onions and making me cry
#####
He‚Äôs not even president, yet he‚Äôs already making the country a better place.
#####
Money is a tool. We NEED to choose Andrew Yang so he can  implement the Freedom Dividend to all Americans. What good does it do any of us if all of tools are concentrated where they are unable to be used.
#####
Tears
#####
he does not blame the Trump voters. He blames the system that made these people so desperate that they had to elect him. He's trying to fix this system.
#####
music very annoying, it bugs the hell when trying to listen.
#####
What's with the slasher music
#####
Yang shows mankind can be awesome !!! Freedom dividend WorldWide !!!
#####
Is it for both of them?
#####
Andrew Yang must be invited to Ellen's show !! This is a positive phenomenon.üíú‚úåÔ∏èüí∏
#####
I can definitely see the freedom dividend going up to $1500 to $2000 in the future isn't that awesome?!
#####
Everyone pls share and spread the word about our future president Mr.Andrew yang a lot of people don‚Äôt know anything about him üíØüíØ pls save our country this man is a gift from god we can‚Äôt loose him we need him
#####
Thoughts and prayers are worthless don‚Äôt pay the bills.
#####
Some of our Billionaires believe in controlling the masses... so Yang is our man. Choose humanity first.
#####
$1000/month maybe nothing for certain rich people but $1000/month mean a lot and sometimes can save a life for most people.
#####
A gesture of Dignity.
#####
I want 1000 dollars a month and i will go on tv saying that i will gladly give up my freedom to join the chain gang.   It sounds so promising that everyone gets a freedom dividend of free printed goverment money...   the more we can hollow out the middle class and make everyone rely on welfare printed money of 1000 a month.  thats trickle up economy to make more slaves.  We really like it.  Promise the world and then own them.
#####
I‚Äôm a pretty committed libertarian, and am having a lot of trouble reconciling my principles with his policies. But damn if this guy isn‚Äôt enticing.
#####
I love how he actually goes around the company to do the things he believes in
#####
Imagine how much 1k a month would help IndieDevs that are starting their career\dream!
#####
Instead of giving empty promises, the other politicians and the so called rich should do something practical for the common people. Whether he gets elected or not, Andrew will be remembered as a man who puts humanity first.
#####
Why do we let the rich and powerful decide our lives? It is because we are addicted to phones, bad food, drinking smoking, etc. It starts with us. We need a jumpstart
#####
We are all in survivor mode.. so true around the world.. we need Entrepreneurs and leader like Andrew Yang...
#####
Humanity First. You can see it in his face, he really believes in this.
#####
I pray all Iowa supporters register early and vote! You may not be on IG, FB, YouTube or others social media but rally up and show up when we need you most...at the polls!
#####
Damn 79 degrees inside their house? I'd melt.
#####
all he's doing is buying votes duh
#####
God bless you ‚ÄúAndrew Yang!‚Äù 
Your ideas and solutions to many problems in this country are amazing. It‚Äôs true that many important stay home jobs should be rewarded. I remembered many years ago when my grandmother was dying of cancer and my father had to stop working to care for her. Our family struggled for many months until my grandmother passed away. If we would‚Äôve have the Freedom Dividend back then our family would‚Äôve been in a much stable condition. Thank you!

Reminded me of our President Xi visiting poor families in China, it used to be OUR THING! Chinese government visiting families with low income is a tradition, they have been doing the nation's best to help lifting those families out of poverty.

It really touches people hearts see he does this to people!!
If one day I could receives I will be so happy!!!
#####
That's a cool gesture, but wouldn't it be better to give show them how to make money instead of giving them a handout for 1 year? At the end of the 1 year, they'll be back to where they started. Teach a man fish vs. give a man a fish.
#####
This doesn't sound legal to me at all. It's outright bribery.
#####
Its a nice thing to do, if more multi millionaire would do the same, the world would be a better place.
A a presidential candidate it ;looks like a bit of a stunt.
#####
1000 a month extra, that would literally change my life!!!
#####
This video shows exactly the intention of UBI: to help those who really need help without condition. 1000 a month is a big help to such families, but to those who make over $10k a month, 1k a month UBI is not a big change to their life condition. So priority should be given to those whose income is under a certain amount, or when income increases, UBI decrease correlatively. this way the total amount of government expenditure can be reduced.
#####
This was three months ago? Man, we need to get this back out there so AMERICA SEES he's doing this! visually not just verbally.
#####
Oh my. This vibes make my body shake
#####
we have a wealthfare system in denmark that gives 1000-1500$ to any unemployed person who chose to accept them... (there are some rules but theyre not worth mentioning for now) 


i like the idea of the system even if i think minor things should change but one thing i really would like to change about the system is how people get their hands on the money... instead of having the money put into your account once every month then i wish they would change the system so people had to get out of the door everyday to get their hands on the money... 


ofcourse there will be people who are so sick that they cant walk up to an office and receive a new wealthfare check everyday and the system should make room for those... but so many people forget to live their life (including myself) when they receive wealthfare because they dont have to do anything to get them... if i was forced out of the door -even if its just to stand in line for 30min to get my wealthfare check... then i think it would make a lot of people ask themself... "well if i have to go out the door everyday, then why dont i just get a job instead" and those who are to sick to stay 7,5 hours on a working place eachday but healthy enough to walk out the door and talk to people might even become more healthy by being "forced into a social situation"...
#####
Awww. That was so loving. I think the guy was about to cry when Andrew told him he‚Äôs giving him money.  People just need some compassion and generosity.
#####
Ooo ,Is yang a dc fan ?üòØ
#####
Yang has to work five times harder than the others because of the anemic mainstream media coverage.
#####
Hope UBI succeeds in the US then it won't be long before rest of the world follows and 7 billion of us pushing humanity boldly into the future, ahhh what a dream. We have to stop this nonsense of trying to be number 1 and fearing another nation surpassing the US. Humanity first not just in the USA but the rest of the world too.
#####
If people in the richest country are in survival mode, is there any hope of us living in developing nations?
#####
Why can't he just talk like this during the debates? Instead of having this other voice, this louder, more bombastic voice that kinda comes off too goofy or playful. 

He also should stop doing the hand clap thing during the debates, as if to say "hey watch this trick" like it's some kind of magic show.

Just talk like this andrew from now on, from the heart, sincere, confident and reassuring, with just a bit of geek and you will go all the way. 

Best of luck... even if you dont win the nomination, i think you can at least knock out harris, buttigieg, booker and whoever not top 3 polling EASY.
#####
Honestly I don't know how these people didn't cry when he showed up and let them know they would receive this money from him. I almost cried just watching this because that money would make my life change from night to day. This is absolutely amazing! I'm happy for these people. Congratulations
#####
Andrew‚Äôs laugh always get me. üòÇ
#####
It‚Äôs not a dividend, it‚Äôs a welfare check. This guy is biggest commie charlatan.
#####
So...Pam was diagnosed with cancer and let go (as in 'fired'?) from her job as a result?! No words to describe the inhumanity... Is it up to your employer to keep on paying while employees are ill, probably not, doesn't make sense. I live in a country where your employer pays the first month of sickleave (unless otherwise specified in your contract, my previous employer covered 3 months), then 'medicare' takes over, it's not a full salary, so if you have (privately or via employer) an extra insurance to cover the difference, you keep your full income and can focus on getting better. Also, you cannot be fired during sickleave.
#####
Am I missing something? I don't see him giving that money?
#####
Wow 79F in the house. It must be hot sweat
#####
Andrew yang for president..........he is the only one who can save America    yang gang 2020 !!!
#####
Wow... Just wow ..üëçüëçüëç
#####
Yang Gang, c'mon guys, you need to spread the word more. Make sure this guy becomes president otherwise you will be failing not just America but the rest of the world watching. Man I can watch videos like this all day. Keep it up.
#####
no way american do not vote for this man.
#####
We don't need "thoughts and prayers".  We need CASH!  Thank you Andrew Yang for showing us the right way!
#####
I teared up
#####
Andrew Yang is not a politician and that is correct, he keeps his word to the people. I believe he will keep his word when he is elected. He is the person that should lead this country... Humanity First. #Yang2020.
#####
Man, look at that thermostat set  on 79,  just to cut back on the light bill a little bit.  Andrew is such a good person to help this family, and talks about things NOONE else does!  I've lost 2 convenience store jobs in my life with no warning or notice, just because the boss didn't want us walking out to -hello- look for another job because we are human beings and have bills, and to be that indifferent because of MONEY..it doesn't matter about us clerks (or truckers or miners ETC ETC), all that matters is the owners precious living.  WOO more robot trucks and Wal Mart self-checkouts, the bigwigs can make more money!
#####
He has human compassion. Wish we have somebody like this in Canada.
#####
You're the best chance we have
#####
The essence of UBI (or Freedom Dividend as Andrew Yang calls it) is a redistribution of wealth from the rich corporates to the average citizens. Given the extremely unequal distribution of wealth in the US, and the increasing trend in inequality, it's high time that some redistribution of wealth is carried our, before an eventual violent revolution....
#####
Ppl should see this is not buying votes! It's humanity first.  It's proof of his policy
#####
I love this.. someone please tell Yang not to stand over people when talking to them.  Ask them to stand up, sit down with them or something.  Get at eye to eye level at all times in personal moments like these.  I'm all in with Yang though.. just offering some advice from a nurse.
#####
The best part is, it's NO STRINGS ATTACHED
#####
Because the truth of the matter is money is the base of all basic needs in our society.
#####
I am a foreigner and a wanna be Democrat and I support him. We can‚Äôt let trump win another terms. It bad for the world in the short term but in the Long term bad for USA
#####
Are you kidding me???? so this politician thinks he has the right to BRIBE individuals to vote for him by giving them money???? This is or should be illegal for any politician to do...where did this money come from? of course from his campaign fund.....ridiculous and disastrous ideology for all Americans! And all the fake comments on how great he is, what a lie and meant to deceive ignorant, uneducated and misinformed people only
#####
Yang also says you can opt out of the freedom dividend. Perhaps those that are well to do can contribute their share to paying down our debt. Food for thought...
#####
It's 2019 and it's time for some Americans to realize a few things.
1) Thoughts and prayers are useless.
2) Big companies don't care about you.
3) Soldiers don't serve their country, they serve big companies.
4) Big corporations will fight as much as they can to avoid paying taxes and make people's lives better.
#####
Yes Andre yang for president 2020 I am refugee so I know how much you would help people with low income like us with no education. Like our parents that are still looking for education and still trying to provide for us so thank you
#####
ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE     A single person with a clarity of conscience and a willingness to speak up can make a difference. Contributing to the greater good is a deep and fundamental human need. When a leader, even a mid-level or lower level leader, skillfully brings a voice and a vision, others will follow and surprising things can happen‚Äîeven culture change on a large scale.

#####
Another thing I like about Yang is that he's willing to use great ideas created by other people and then credits them for it!  He listens for great ideas!  He would create and utilize a wonderful cabinet if he became President, and they wouldn't constantly quit on him because they would feel valued.

Yang mentioned "affiliates of those businesses"  as people who have the money, which is very true. In times of increasing technology, those people are utilizing the internet and digital technology to earn more money, which is also what I am doing now and earning a full time income big time.

#####
Wow!! Hope Democrats will make the right decision.  Nominate Andrew Yang to beat Trump.  Make him your president.
#####
All of this sounds expensive.  And hard to say how effective it might be.  Why not simply publish income tax filings for people that hold a public office?  Come to think of it, we should be publishing a lot of tax data, from corporations to non-profits to religious institutions ... heck my own tax information should be public.  And if I my income came from some post that I was elected to, my name and address should not be redacted.

Nice guy, but no, not now.  Maybe in 20 more yrs.

Andrew Yang is the first candidate in a long time that I really WANT as president, not just some lesser-of-two-evils choice.  We have a serious problem - I‚Äôm writing this after watching the first (2nd night) democratic debate and it‚Äôs crazy how little they let Andrew talk tonight and how shamelessly they (MSNBC) favor the candidates they like by giving them all the talk time.  I know it sounds naive that I‚Äôm complaining about the media being biased (no, ya don‚Äôt say!) but you don‚Äôt really notice the severity until the candidate you‚Äôre rooting for is being marginalized.  I hope America pays more attention to clips like this one rather then judging candidates based off those ridiculous ‚Äúdebates‚Äù that are basically just the news media‚Äôs version of the WWE ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Yang 2020
#####
Biden will be 81 and Bernie 82 at their 4th year of presidency if elected. Too old and frail for a fast paced society. Yang (44) is driven, dynamic, genuine and has smart modern ideas for a modern society (And dare I say it: He puts a smile on our faces, can't stop watching this next president)
#####
I keep waiting for daily new Andrew Yang videos.  Great ideas.  Great communicator. Smart as hell. Self effacing, funny and nice.  I don‚Äôt recall where he didn‚Äôt have a logical, well thought out answer to any question posed to him.  Please donate to his campaign whatever you can give.  We need an intelligent man in the White House.  Let‚Äôs do the MATH.
#####
Question that no Yangker can answer.
Who is going to give Yang's wife 'Social Value credit points' for staying at home with their 2 children?
She'll get U.B.I. + Social Points.

Who will pay the Social Points (which is equivalent to currency)
#####
Make the democracy dollars $300
#####
First person in decades to come up with a brilliant idea to solve that problem of donor money. As for regulators... pay them but they have to basically sign a non compete... awesome!
#####
Don‚Äôt lose faith in yourself
People actually thought Ted Cruz was going to be the nominee for some time
Have more one-to-one interviews on how your ideas will help them individually
#####
As much as I like Andrew Yang, and would vote for him, the sad truth is he will not receive any support from the corrupted corporate delegates and super delegates - which nulls the vote of the democratic people. Yang will be treated the same as Bernie Sanders in 2016 - publicly shamed at and stepped on by the DNC.

If Yang happens to triumph over this milestone by becoming the democratic nominee, then he will have to go up against Trump. Most Americans overwhelmingly support a strong economy and immigration policy, which both offer a significant amount of votes. The American people will vote Trump come 2020 because of these two reasons alone. In addition, the current mainstream democrats and liberal social media outlets relentlessly make Trump look good. When Trump should look bad, the opposite occurs due to a _'boy who cried wolf'_ effect.
#####
He has the best policy ever. But most American still trust trump more than yang. Isn't that crazy ??
#####
https://youtu.be/SJh_Uir5EMI compare to the FDIC..
Have a redux moment, Limited examination of corporate annual reports and national magazines reveals numerous instances of management difficulties in trying to run a business successfully in the Pace of the many defects in the Excess Profits Tax Act . Statements from some 85 companies in a dozen industries reemphasize the arguments made two years ago.... Short of an amendment to the law, it is difficult or practically impossible to grant relief in those cases where the tax has a particularly harsh impact. Ample evidence of this fact lies in the 23 technical and structural changes made in the Excess Profits Tax Act by the Revenue Act of 1951‚Äìwith special provisions for companies that had been able to convince the tax-writing Congressional committees of particular injustices.
#####
applause from California, cannot wait for the June Presidential debate, you go Yang!!!
#####
Easily one of the smartest people to ever run for office.
#####
Another important point although he didn‚Äôt mention it is that is that once the people get that money then a lobbyist who doesn‚Äôt work in the interest of the people will not have a voice because they most likely won‚Äôt get the people‚Äôs support and it really levels the playing field. This is at least my understanding of it
#####
How refreshing and super awesome, this man is talking common/logical sence....can not wait to see him in the debates. Go Mr Andrew Yang!

"I've done the math..."

Something we've never heard a politician ever say.
#####
Andrew has the mind to be a great president. His answers are on point. Doesn't leave you scratching your head confused when other politicians answer a question.  They usual redirect the topic or just state problems, and not give solutions like Andrew Yang does. YANG GANG is coming. üòéüòéüåäüåäüåä

Gotta slow it down

If the president, who makes $400k, would do favors for companies for extra money, why wouldn't the regulators who will only make the $250k proposed by Yang and Sheila Bair>
#####
Andrew Yang is like I dig into the numbers and I see the problems and I think of these solutions. Other politicians are like dramatic emotional TV reality show personalities America love.
#####
Why does it seem like his solutions are just to throw more money at the problem?


Corrupt campaigns? Democracy dollars
Payed off regulators? Quadruple their salary
Selfish presidents? Tenfold their salary
Unemployment? UBI
College Debt? Debt forgiveness


Cool guy but would like an explanation on this.

Trump got elected through stealth his supporters didn't talk to pollsters Hillary was a shoe in everyone thought we should do the same don't tip off the opposition Yang could slide in with a shocking result we saw in 2016
#####
Something I'm really curious about is that Donald Trump's greatest weapon is essentially that whether you like him or not, he's very capable of stirring emotions up in people and that's evident by the amount of people who either worship him as a pseudo God Emperor (I mean the fact that people actually call him GEOTUS is astounding in itself) or hold him in such contemptuous loathing is a key example of that. He's also very adversarial and this is evidenced further in his catch phrases for people on the other end of the spectrum. With that said, I'm actually really curious as to how he feels or would feel about Andrew Yang who's so deeply inoffensive, so charismatic and someone who comes off as genuinely just wanting the best for the people around him.
#####
Yang is just so cool, awesome n definitely qualified
#####
Your not an anomaly your the mf truth
#####
I donated $22 to his campaign, and I'm really, really cheap! Yang is THAT good. Pitch in people! :) If everyone does, we could actually make this man president!
#####
Love this man
#####
He's a man with the plan. Get him into the house.
#####
I don't think a democracy dollars bill would pass in Congress.
#####
......Unfortunately, some human beings are naive and politically ignorant ....and they get very excited and carried away by the presidential candidates they support .....rather than being pragmatic, rational, and wise.... A presidential candidate, like Andrew Yang, who has created and would like to implement a DIZZYING list of 100 + promises and policies !!!!!!! ......and that number is growing weekly...probably "hundreds" of policies by 2020..........a candidate who is also willing to have a Psychologist at the White House....? ...unheard of worldwide....! 

"Math." is of course a good tool and very often "a necessary condition" for a policy to be realized and performed with success ....but Math. is not necessarily "a sufficient condition" to accomplish any policy....and we've had millions of those examples among politicians worldwide........specially when the number of policies is so big !! ...good intentions do not always follow good results... 

Political History has always shown us that most of those HUGE numbers of policies ...100+ !!...couldn't be at the end, realized and carried out the way the Candidate had expected them to be accomplished....for many reasons... Never let your heart lead your brain ...do not get carried away by good intentions or exciting and interesting speeches, hundreds of policies and promises ....the results could be very disappointing ....!

Yang has the most robust platform to fix our political system.

I kind of feel bad that the average American is too dumb to vote for Andrew yang even though for voting for him would be in their best interest. Wake up America and get woke

Thanks Andrew for your message! Automation is not only replacing manufacturing jobs but is gutting white collar jobs into a new underclass of human computation work or piecemeal microwork. Think AI training data work such as checking photos of Uber drivers etc. Run by Amazon's mTurk, Google's EWOQ, Microsoft's UHRS platforms. College graduates are ending up in these jobs that are currently statistically unrecorded, unregulated, unprotected, with little employee rights. Please, please help address this issue.

He is an idiot talking to other idiots! His plan is nothing but an inflation mill! It would wipe out what those on social security get and they worked and paid for theirs!  His plan does nothing for them ! And inflation would take out the thousand in a month with those wanting their share of the pie. With higher prices! This school is a dumb farm raising stupid! And it shows!
#####
Yang for president 2020.
#####
Andrew Yang is all we need for our president in 2020.  The only one to beat mr. Racist.
#####
I wished I was not a poor man and I wished I was an American Because of Andrew Yang. You all are lucky you have a great leader. If I was you I'd vote for him. The man is caring and intelligent.
#####
Yang will not be President in 2020 since he will not get the senior vote primarily because his UBI seems to discriminate against seniors in the respect that workers receive wages and when opted-in will receive the UBI added to their wages. In contrast seniors receiving Social Security, the majority cannot opt-in since benefits are more than the UBI. It seems discriminatory since seniors should be able to opt-in, get the UBI, and keep their benefits which are much lower than wages even minimum wage in comparison. Therefore, it seems doubtful Yang will get the millions of votes which seniors represent‚Ä¶..
#####
This guy used "F" word too much. Can't run for a leader.
#####
president of the internet in such a short time! yanggang2020!!!
#####
He is so human.
#####
President Zi and President Yang. Wow, this is the world power!
#####
Make sure you register as a Democrat if you want to vote Andrew in the primaries! My husband and I just switched!
#####
Can somebody explain to me the joke about being management consultant in Europe. I am a foreigner so I just do not get what's funny...
#####
Andrew Yang is a very interesting person.
#####
Donated $17.76 to the YangGang.
#####
I like the way Andrew thinks....he is humble and a realist with pragmatic solutions.EVERY neighbourhood in the world needs a Yang
#####
#YangGang
#####
I will vote for him
#####
Finally! Someone who is truly down to earth enough to speak *GENUINELY* and *OPENLY* to college students, many of which would benefit from his policies.
#####
He does really well in these college talks. He's so dynamic, funny, relatable, youthful, and charismatic. This is an older video, but one of the better ones. I notice he's only shaking hands with the Dartmouth Chads there, but then, anyone would. The other candidates are so boring - I don't even know what they ever talk about!
#####
Andrew Yang intelligent competent solution!
#####
VOTE FOR YANG AND DONATE EVEN IF ITS A DOLLAR SO HE CAN GET INTO THE PRIMARIES!Then he will give you back by a THOUSAND fold WHEN he wins!
#####
What a breath of fresh air! A genuine people's representative who has a sharp insight into the the problems people are struggling with and he has real wise solutions to them. He is not only intelligent but wise and he has the heart in the rigth place! He is the man to do the job!
#####
Told my kids about Andrew Yang and they love him.  My youngest one said he wants to move to Alaska now.  Lol
#####
Put your money where you mouth is‚Äô and he is the only one who did Yang2020
#####
Andrew yang needs to do more college tour.
#####
Boom üí• üëç
#####
Has he done anything to condemn Trump on his racist view? I didn't see anything from him on the news.
#####
"I see some yang gangster here..its the most wholesome gang you can ever join" - Andrew Yang.
#####
This is the first time Ive ever joined a gang!! YANG GANG--- 2020!! Lets spread the word since the media has already chosen their candidates.
#####
I absolutely loathe the fact that walmart etc point their underpaid/part time employees to public assistance to save on costs. Tax dollars are subsidizing them. Same with the wall street bs. It's the citizens turn for a much needed bailout.
#####
Trump2020!!! Unless Yang gets the nomination. Then I‚Äôm switching parties to vote for him.
#####
he starts off his own claps LMFAO
#####
He's so down to earth, no wonder he stands out so much from other candidates
#####
Those who oppose the Freedom Dividend are the selfish people who don't need the $1000. They don't think people(who need the money to survive) should have it.
#####
Yang NEEDS to be president. He will drive this country in the direction it needs to go. 
Please, if you cant donate money CALL. Just go on the website and click volunteer. You just call people and its super easy!
#####
spread the word online, lets surge the internet with YangGang
We will be the talk online
#####
I love this guy! Spread the word, donate, vote, anything you can. We need Andrew
#####
Not only is Mr. Yang smart. He also has a sense of humor.
#####
Yang for President, now that would be amazing! for all the people.
#####
I'm vote for you man. I been telling all the teachers and others workers. They should vote for you. 

$1,000 can go a long way
#####
He has a great personality. That qualifies him as an excellent janitor. Next!
#####
Yang is a true progressive.  He is offering out-of-the-box solutions to evolve our economy into the 21st century.  He is focused on a people centric nation that values everyone regardless of your social, economic, or ethnic status.

Andrew Yang 
What's your views on Puerto üáµüá∑ Rico and our rights or the ones we don't have? How are infrastructure is crumbling in PR, corrupt thieving govt here.
#####
Dear everyone Yang *needs* our support. Mainstream/Establishment hates him. To keep him going he needs to poll higher. Please register to vote as a Democrat (Yang's Party).  Share him with everyone you know and love. Yang2020.com
#####
he's witty! love it!
#####
This guy is articulate even when customizing his talk for the specific audience. 
"80% of you'll do 6 things at 6 places."
#####
We need a reasonable person, who is intelligent, explains things well, and understands the bigger picture as President.  This is Andrew Yang, let's progress our country forward!
#####
I can't wait to see Andrew Yang just crucify Trump in a formal debate when the time comes!! :-D You're going down orange man!
#####
He will run the country like a company CEO.
#####
Mr. Yang, you need to be making a stump at every major college in each state.
#####
Wow! This moved me more than the personal sob stories of the other candidates. Very refreshing to hear this man talk.
#####
If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or Nevada *please* consider caucusing! That's how Yang can win the nomination and, ultimately, the presidency!
#####
Yangtubers please share this with your subscribers. We need more journalists yanged and then more people provide contents for him and politics is tied to local cultures.
#####
First time ever, made a donation to a political candidate and it's to Yang; also, changed election registration from Independent to Democrat in order to vote for Andrew Yang in the primaries 2020.
#####
He has thought about everything and has a solution for it all.  He makes too much sense.  How can you vote for any  other candidate.
#####
Yang's face needs to be slapped onto MT. Rushmore
#####
Andrew Yang fot President 2020. Rock Islands of Palau to America.  Amazing Grace, just sing it once.
#####
The old guy in the front row looks mad he was disturbed from him nap.
#####
He is absolutely right without small newspapers there would be rampant corruption in the local political system as no one knows whats really going on. He's the real MAGA candidate here don't be blinded by the other main stream politicians. VOTE YANG FOR PRESIDENT our last hope to save America.
#####
Interesting idea to combine library with local paper..Local libraries are like local Starbuck-community halls. Its not a bad idea and could be sustainable..
#####
I really like Yang. I like his style, I like how genuine he sounds, I like the fact that he's got decent research to support pretty much all of his policy proposals, and I'm kinda getting sold on the idea of UBI.
But... I feel like this is also insufficient. It's a bandaid. It doesn't address the massive inequalities that are building up in the system. All this will do is maybe give just enough to the people who get increasingly dropped by the system. A bit higher low, but which will become increasingly low as real inflation and cost of living keep going up and this is inadequately incremented.
It's not very hard to foresee a near future where a huge chunk of the population is just relegated to this insufficient UBI.
It's also not very hard to imagine how much of this UBI which is supposed to help fuel local economy might just end up being spent buying stuff on Amazon anyways...
#####
This dudes fucking gets it and it crazy.
#####
believe it or not, this is probably one of the biggest reason why trump won as well. automation of jobs, and blindly following self-propelled journalism that has no value (in other words -- fake news). you believe the lies because you trust that the news never lies, but in truth they're owned by these big money corporations and bending truths and hiding events behind double speak and lesser prominence. this is the way to bring back not only true (unbiased) journalism, but to get people more involved, in community and in country.
#####
I‚Äôm so glad a candidate has shed light on what‚Äôs been plaguing journalists everywhere. Andrew yang just earned this journalism major‚Äôs vote
#####
We have local paper here in Martinsburg, wv, but the paper is actually printed in Frederick, MD. That was the cheapest way to keep the paper. Kmart has closed, Food lion grocery is gone from here. The are trying to make new businesses. Towns from 45 min away come here to shop. Walmart is ok, this little city is iffy, you take a chance putting a business here. We are all so poor, we get by barely. So I'm all for the freedom divided, maybe in the end the rest of this state, that is worse than here, the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, might get better.
#####
Is this whole q and a available to watch ? I'm watching as many as possible and I wana see this whole thing
#####
I‚Äôm a local journalist and  it‚Äôs really nice to be told that I‚Äôm appreciated instead of being told that I‚Äôm fake news by a politician
#####
It makes me cry to watch the reaction of the gentleman reporter in the front row. When I watched on my phone I couldn‚Äôt see his face clearly, so I watched again on my iPad. His face just lit right up! :‚Äô) :‚Äô) :‚Äô) I wish I know his name so that I can look up the articles he wrote.
Thanks for caring, Andrew! üíñüíñüíñ
#####
His solutions to all the big and entrenched problems seem to me common sense. Yet all the other  politicians have not come up something close. Not sure if they are not capable of or they don‚Äôt have the intention to provide solutions. Either way it shows the uniquely quality of Yang.
#####
He will make a good president
#####
Dear Andrew and gang. My idea for this is very similar to your democracy dollar. Why not give every American (from birth) a fund to subscribe to and thus support the news-media that appeals to them. It should not be possible to spend the mediabucks on anything else than that. It will give an enormous boost to journalism, I suspect.
#####
Just saw this #YangGang hit Like!!!!
#####
Andrew Yang is the only candidate ever who identified USA's chronic problems and knows how to solve them.  Make Andrew Yang your president.
#####
Fucking incredible how he can be asked about something relatively small like local newspaper, and pull out studies and thought out conversations based on many perspectives outside his own
#####
Never felt so happy to vote for a presidential candidate before. President Andrew Yang 2020. Let's pull together and make this happen üí™
#####
this man is an angel god sent us -- and i'm not religious
if we don't vote him into office, we're f***ed, i mean more f***ed, really really f***ed
#####
I said it a year ago when I saw him speak at a conference. Just common sense
#####
Although I was born in Canada so this doesn't necessarily apply, I would be sad to see my hometown newspaper (Regina, Saskatchewan Leader Post) die out.  From the second grade I would spread out the newspaper on the living room carpet, and I read a great deal of it (I was an odd kid).
#####
If you agree, please "Like" this video so that more people can meet Andrew Yang!
#Yang2020!
#####
STATE Media...gets more Chinese Communist Party every time he speaks.
#####
Andrew Yang is heartbleach or soulbleach (like eyebleach, but for the heart and soul).
#####
I love that old man's nod of approval. He definitely got yang'd.
#####
Andrew, if you havent already, write a book about how you would run the country. So that your knowledge will be shared throughout the ages.
#####
We Yang Gang now fam
#####
smart man
#####
The size of brain on this guy is something we've never seen. He has thoughtful answers and solutions to almost every damn problem.
#####
You know what I would say? Let's say if a small town of 10,000 people, receiving $1,000 a month, the money will circulate in the town, create jobs, people become cogs in a giant machinery, enjoy arts, creativity, and generate more money flow. 

Local journalism? Sure, they can report about what's going on in the town, with a new bakery popping up at the corner of the city, a new playground showing up at the school, local activities, local news. .. 

They don't have to rely on big, gossip news like Kardashisan or Micky Minaj to survive. They can just be happy with their lifestyles and become more creative and adventurous. 

Granted, if a prodigy genius in the town become Einstein and create something good for the entire country, VAT will take care of the ingenuity and creativity spawned at the very right town. 

That's how the Freedom Dividend will solve almost all the problems.
#####
Print media is already dead. Fake News killed itself. Entertainment is half dead and contents are the future. And it‚Äôs none of governments business to mess with media which is independent. State controlled media leads to ultimate socialist Utopia for sure.
#####
It's so apparent that Andrew works tirelessly for our Democracy Country, please help Andrew to spread his campaign across our 52 US States, the time is right now to have a True Patriotic President to lead our country out from this quagmire and wrangling.
#####
I like how future Prez Yang talks to local people about local problems and demonstrates clear logic and conviction on how to tackle problems which will energize people to change the old ways of thinking.
#####
I love andrew yang . He use so many yuge words. lots of words . very good words. words words words .
#####
I agree. We need to do something!
#####
Sign the petition to get Andrew Yang in the Ellen show. https://www.change.org/p/https-twitter-com-theellenshow-get-andrew-yang-on-ellen-degeneres?source_location=petitions_browse
#####
Where was this? Please update the description.
#####
I disagree with Yang on this policy issue. Newspapers have become obsolete for a reason. Reviving the industry won't be beneficial if Americans don't choose to read newspapers.
#####
so Andrew Yang wants a $1000 a month UBI for those 18 to 64, to be paid by a 10% VAT.  Therefore a retiree like myself would pay the VAT, but not get the UBI.  And he wants us to vote for him?  He is an idiot to believe that would happen!  Thankfully he has 0 chance of getting the nomination.
#####
Anyone in favor of boycotting CNN, ABC, or whatever news station doesn't give him fair screentime say I!
#####
You can't save what's already dead. Newspapers are not coming back. Millenials aren't buying them and younger generations probably have never read one. I associate the word newspaper with old.
#####
üëè awesome
#####
I feel that Mr Yang's comments are sound. Also, this is an aspect of the campaign that hasn't been touched on much during his interviews. I hope it gets discussed more during the future debates.
#####
the yang gang made it in to a church to spread that positive message on his way of becoming the president for 2020
#####
He could use this to appeal to the Trump base. Just throw in a "mainstream" here and a "Fake News" there and boom! They eat it up. Lol
#####
To the editor and publisher of this YouTube channel. I love these short clips and I‚Äôm subbed to the channel but I‚Äôm wondering if you could make 10 minute edits of Andrew speaking as well. It would help with the algorithm. I‚Äôll post this on several videos till you respond. I think we‚Äôd all love to see more comprehensive talks
#####
yang is wrong about local papers- just obsolete technology. usa is not a democracy, it is ruled by politicians working for rich people. citizen quality people would maintain a local area web-site, to serve most of the functions of local newspapers. but americans aren't. they are not raised and educated to be citizens, so they are passive zombies used to being told what to do.
yang isn't trying to establish democracy, he's just aiming to make plutocracy more livable. nothing wrong with that, better than what the politicians are offering, but he can't save you. you have to save yourself.
#####
Remember Andrew Yang is made in America.
#####
Tears of joy and hope from me.
#####
Yang's "News & Information Ombudsman" Policy *repeals* the 1'st Amendment.... That doesn't kill  EVERY newspaper & news outlets in the world??? He's an INVALID candidate.
#####
Wow!  He has real solutions!  It's true.  I miss the crisp feeling of opening up a morning newspaper.  We need local newpaper to keep in touch with things that are going on with our community, things that matters to our daily lives.  Also when you get a chance watch his solution to improve our local schools and our children's education and health.  It's most enlightening.  #yang2020
#####
love you yang
#####
Local journalism is the antidote for the Main Stream Fake News Corporate Media
#####
Yang or Trump once again
#####
Local journalism better than Main Stream Fake News Corporate Media
#####
Yang has trump confidence with facts to back that up!
#####
Where can i find the full video of this?
#####
Yang cares for our society, our democracy, our nation and our people.
Real problem solving at its best,
Yang is the man.
Real solutions to move us forward.
No more actors, or celebrities, or unqualified personalities in the White House..
Let‚Äôs wake up to a new America,üá∫üá∏
an America in which ‚Äúhumanity takes presidency, by putting its people first‚Äù.
Yang 2020 let‚Äôs go!!!!!
#####
Yang is soooo good & caring to work towards carving-out permanent places for our Humanity to thrive - like Local Journalism & Mom/Pop Businesses. Humanity First indeed!
#####
He's the first political figure that we can learn from. Freaking brilliant mind
#####
I was a registered non-partisan until yesterday, when I switched to Democrat so that I could vote for this guy in the primaries.
#####
Newspapers are a waste of resources how about town and cities stop being lazy and make an app so people can stay updated and see local business. No vote from me
#####
A major community newspaper in the capital city just closed down this week. As a former journalist and newspaper advertising manager, I can testify it‚Äôs not expensive at all to run a local newspaper. It all comes down to a small group of capable and ethical professionals. I hope more people subscribe to this channel and give more support to Yang.
#####
Real journalism beats detective or even cia. Ever wonder why Spider-Man and Batman had connections or worked there, lol.
#####
Yang has to win, he has incredibly good ideas n solutions
#####
Andrew Yang is getting my vote! Yang/Gabbard 2020 yay!
#####
He is so passionate about so many of his policy ideas! You can tell he's running for President not for the title or prestige, but because he feels it's the only way to make real change in the desperate situation that our country is in right now!
#####
If someone looked at me the way that gentleman is looking at Andrew Yang at 2:19, then my life would be complete!
#####
Mr. Yang. this is the first time I am going to disagree with you. I worked for a local News Paper for 14yrs. I would attend meetings, at the meetings, when it came to Subscription we had one million for English version of our paper. The Spanish version did a lot better, sold in Mexico, Miami, South America etc. According to the bosses in the meetings, Americans wasn't reading newspapers anymore only the Hispanics. Also the Newspaper is moving towards the Internet, Television and Radio. People want there information faster and they see newspapers as dead media. I lost my job to outsourcing to India. I hope you win the presidency, because you know the Truth and what the real problems are.
#####
‚úÖ
#####
Jesus Christ, Yang is so good. So good I'm scared this corrupt country is going to do everything to make him look insignificant when he is the only person I have ever known to get me excited for the future.
#####
Yang for president in 2020.
#####
This guy has ideas ..good ones that no oe else is even talking about ... now we need to wrench the $$$$$ for those ideas from the military industrial complex....
#####
Andrew cares about things that make a difference. make him the president already !!!!!
#####
The 2 people who disliked are from Australia
#####
If local newspapers do little more than spew out fake news like what we see on ABC, CBS, FOX, etc, then they deserve to die.
#####
This man  brought me to tears every time I watch him
#####
Once again, Andrew is leading and bringing solutions to problems other candidates won‚Äôt even talk about. They‚Äôre all running on identity politics and opportunism. Andrew is out here LEADING. You know. Like a president. ‚ù§Ô∏è
#####
Leave it to Yang to address problems we didn't even consider. I learn so much from this guy it's crazy ‚ô° Yang Gang!
#####
Yang will bring a new golden age in America. He's our gift from God.
#####
Hm. Interesting. I don't see that throwing money at the problem is going to solve it.Why not ask News aggregators like Google an Apple to support local bloggers and include them in their revenue models?
#####
I'm all rooting for Yang, but just because he becomes president. It doesn't mean he'll get the bill passed that everyone gets 1k a month.
#####
One of the problems I noticed in my own state is that during the last election, it was very hard to get information about the numerous local and state issues on the ballot. There were very few papers giving analyses on the issues and many of the ones that did hid their information behind paywalls. Most voters are not going to pay for access and will instead opt to stay in the dark, which leads to voters being less-informed. That is bad for everyone.
#####
I love Andrew, but he needs to cut the goofy overly animated jokey type vibe. No one is in a joking mood across the country. Just speak facts and command respect. He's speaking nothing but facts, down to abortion rights. But his serendipity type personality is not resonating in this climate of scarcity.
#####
Seriously, why do I not hear the other candidates talking about this? Once again, Yang fighting the good fight üëçüèª
#####
He's got style...morals **and** aesthetic...I like.
#####
What's a billion $$ here and there? #Spend2020. 
The loss of local papers infuriates him. Makes him mad that the internet has pretty much done away with them. So his  $billion (our tax money) plus a matching $billion from the FCC (also our tax money) will be used to fund local papers?? So, basically a government run press?? Along with this (though not mentioned in this clip) are his government paid journalists plan. So im doing the MATH here. A government subsidized newspaper with government paid journalists is likely going to be reporting what? Fair unbiased reports? Bi-partisan ideas? 
Mr Yang, are you actively campaigning for a totalitarian government? And if so, whom will it be controlled by? Ahh yes. The tech geniuses and the retail giants. The tech guys decide who works. (You've said plumbers and electricians are tough to automate away.) The retail giants decide what products are available and at what cost. (Nothing too expensive though...the UBI is after all only $1000)
And the government decides who gets what surgery (medicare for all) and what people see in the local papers and possibly in the future, media run entirely by the government. 
If only there were a similar country to look at for inspiration. Hmm. Oh I know. North Korea. Seems like it's working for them...not.

#####
We should allow for a free market when it comes to journalism. The future of news and media is online. The old stodgy outlets are dying and giving way to new online outlets. Some are good and some are not, but people need to educate themselves on which ones are reliable.
#####
Probably just witnessed the conversion of his front row audience into YANG GANG MEMBERS (if they aren‚Äôt already) this man is a gem whose genuine nature shines through!
#####
Fox let people talk ur Men women say to much
#####
Free money is NEVER the answer. The questions surrounding such an initiative are numerous. Who is distributing the money? How to verify who got the money and how it was spent? The biggest question of all is, where is this free money coming from? To gloss over questions like these and many others by inferring human kindness is simply smoke and mirrors. Money may be able to establish self help programs where accountability can be measured. If the homeless and "down and out" don't subscribe to personal responsibility programs, little to nothing can be done for them. A bottom line is needed here. Not everyone can be rich. Individuals need to make the best of the stratus dictated by the circumstances surrounding their ability to participate in the capitalist system which has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system world wide. The questions also needing to be asked are, what percentage of Americans are homeless or desperately struggling to avoid homelessness? Is it a number significant enough to run a campaign on? Shouldn't charitable organizations be in charge of such localized scenarios instead of a government who has been trusted very little with our tax dollars? Bleeding hearts should not demand the government to be the cure for these fractional problems. They should organize and do their best to have as much of an effect as possible.

Laura one of the Bias paid journalist

I am voting for Andrew Yang, for a better world
#####
What did this trumpitch do to Andrew's voice?
#####
What‚Äôs happening to his voice

I like yang btw
#####
A lot of ppl are aggressive because they are afraid to let other ppl talk because they are threatened by the truth or different/new ideas. People who talk loud or cut other ppl off are those who are driven by fear, they are insecure and broken. Also fox news pays their pawns to be aggressive. She's just a pawn.
#####
She didn't even give I'ma chance to speak and then she talked over him in the middle of his response
#####
What a joke of a plan, lets just hand out youre tax dollars to drug addicts and hope they do something contructive with the money! Im confident that most of the people slamming laura are liberals who probably dont care at all how extremely biased and slanderous cnn, abc, cbs, msnbc, etc. Are towards conservatives both citizen and politician alike. Too bad!! Fox is not here to cater to liberals, but to report the actual news and yes they offer their opinions, but they do it way better than the aforementioned networks do, just look at the ratings reports if you dont believe me.
#####
This woman is rude and shows her lack of professionalism. She has an agenda and she is not very clever in making it so obvious by interrupting him constantly. Terrible interviewer.
#####
she is soooooo bad. Nothing is worse than a snob, ignorant and entitled human being
#####
Ingram is just awful as a host
#####
Look at the fear she has on her face. So afraid of Yang. Every chance she gets she cuts him off so he can‚Äôt challenge her. What a pathetic looser. Great job Yang for keeping your composure and professionalism. Once and you beat with kindness and respect. This just come to show he will be a great president who will lead us forward.
#####
She is a B***h. I can‚Äôt wait for her to hit rock bottom. Hopefully, god hears our prayer and put her in her place. Be careful Laura, black voo doo coming your way.
#####
‚ÄúReally interesting conversation‚Äù she said... Interesting for her üòÇ
#####
Straw man fallacy: this lady is directing all the interview and facts to mislead Yang instead of having an open minded discussion about his politics. Example, she‚Äôs presenting states mostly governed by democrats and relating that the rate of poverty is due to that reason. Is this right or wrong? We don‚Äôt know. She just trying to make him look like his proposals are useless. In other words, the interview is totally biased.
#####

you are a successful capitalist. really unwise
#####
He a rare Democrat who actually has some solutions...
#####
Laura‚Äôs got a point about giving out cash money to homeless is a disaster I agree I think you should wake up to the fact that you‚Äôre blowing that money down the drain there are definite solutions but it goes far beyond keep on giving cash
#####
Always be right by interrupting someone trying to make a point...
#####
She is so annoying!?  She needs to let him finish talking.
#####
She was just intimidated by his intelligence.
#####
UBI is a great idea. I am a PhD student. Most of the income I have is tied to tuition fees and living. I would like to start some form of entrepreneurship on the side. But I don‚Äôt have enough capital because my family isn‚Äôt rich enough. This is what Yang is getting at. People who have ideas but are tied to the system we live in. It‚Äôs not a hand out either. Tech companies use our data to generate revenue. So, if somebody needs an equipment from me for their business, they either need to buy it or rent it from me unless I am willing to let them borrow it. This is what older people can‚Äôt grasp because the good being exchanged is not tangible. It‚Äôs like going to a trader in the Middle Ages and trying to explain credit cards to them. They only understand gold coins because that‚Äôs all they have known.
#####
Disliked the video. This lady spoke 99% of the time. Super condescending, biased and kept interrupting. Also straight up dismissed Yang. Get her fired Fox News or you will lose viewers.
#####
Let him talk
#####
Laura, Why do you interrupt Andrew constantly after you ask him a question?  If you don't let him answer, and you keep giving your answers over the top of him talking, you will only get your opinion and not hear his.  You came into this not to listen but to put down.  Very bad show, mam.

How the hell is Laura Ingraham is Qualified to do her Job?

The United States is bankrupt, all US corporations are bankrupt and all US citizens are bankrupt. 
In a bankruptcy no one is supposed to have a nicer home than you and no one is supposed to have a nicer car than you and no one is supposed to have more money in their bank account than you. 
Since everyone is bankrupt you are entitled to an equal share of the resources available. People don't understand this concept because they don't understand that everyone is bankrupt and everyone has pledged their assets against the debt. 
This is how the rich share the risk but not the rewards. 
Being bankrupt is like being in a lifeboat at sea. If you catch a fish everyone gets an equal share. Without the bankruptcy the government would be forced to reform and get rid of the Federal Reserve and everyone would get a fresh start or the United States would end.

Shame fox! You lost my respect for the way you conduct this interview.  Obviously, you don't want to hear what Andrew has to offer.  You impose most of your talking points in this interview. Shame on you!
#####
she sucks
#####
I love how conservatives are against giving people handouts, but have no problem giving handouts to major corporations.
#####
Ignoring what yang has to say is the same thing as ignoring the challenges Americans are facing today.
#####
VOTE NO ON YANG.  paid for by dogs and cats.
#####
Please explain to me how do you interview someone and keep cutting them off before they can even answer your question. I don't think that's how interviews go..eww
#####
I think the reason that those cities mentioned by the host have larger scale of homeless people than other areas of this country is not because their regional economy fails but because they are relatively inclusive and homeless people choose to go to there. They could be from all over the other places. It can actually be an evidence that these cities are doing well.
#####
Trump 2020.  Yang has no chance against our President.
#####
Wow this is such a bad questioning, she is like a little school chiled this women.
#####
The worst host ever
#####
I came for yang. I couldnt finish the video because of this lady. Lmao
#####
I‚Äôm interested in Andrews response to the homeless spending money to fuel poor choices
#####
He looked 5 yrs younger here..        Fighting UBI for the people is a heavy load.. Help him in the fight guys..
#####
Just design a special program for the mentally ill and drug addicts instead of sending 150 billion to Iran to create nuclear program so they can strike us back. I mean the sky is the limit. Why give to Iran( I meant for the last administration) when we cant help our own people.
#####
Give a drugie $1000 and he/she is going to what??? Yang you are an IDIOT!!!!
#####
Stop cutting him off
#####
Ingram played this one wrong.
Yang is not like the other lefty dems with stupid talking points.
I dont like alot of his policies, but hes very smart and super respectful.
She wasnt engaging him she was getting to her talking points.

I cant see him as president. But he should absolutely be in the cabinet somewhere. 
Smart guy and thoughtful. He actually uses his brain and he cares
#####
Yang killed it.  Ingram, awful interview
#####
I don‚Äôt know whether to downvote this for Lauren or upvote for Andrew Yang. Which would let Fox News that I dislike Lauren and like Andrew?
#####
Glad she kept his moronic policies in check a bit. People need to be told this garbage won‚Äôt work.
#####
His plan would take a thousand dollars a month out of the hands of the productive half of the country.
#####
So many times I have heard these people saying "Is 1000 bucks a month really anything?" So far from reality of most of us, it's amazingly pathetic. And then the "What if they spend the money in a way I do not approve of?" angle. Yes, some will spend it in an inappropriate manner, just the the way things always are and always have been, deal with it. Then it is always topped off with the 'If you work hard enough you can do anything" crap. If it was so easy, everyone would be doing well, no? I could go on and on regarding the last one, but will stop there for now.
#####
The "ingraham angle special" what's so special about this stuttering interviewer please make her attend ToastMasters meetings... -Thank you!
#####
Laura....let me ask you a question and continously cut you off when you try to answer
#####
What's up with her face expressions ? Is she high on something?
#####
Look, people it's her show. If Laura wants to interject she can interject. In a lot of cases Yang is tossing dirt at Trump which directly contrasts with the statistics we've seen released and Laura is just pointing out that discrepency. I bet you the people Yang's talked to who say they've not noticed a difference with Trump live in the predominately liberal cities where the dems are in control.

Dem's who've done absolutely everything to push back against the economically stimulating policies Trump's tried to use as a blast furnace to boost our economy, with great success in areas where the state governments AREN'T doing everything in their power to try and negate those benefits from the Trump administration to keep the wool over the voters' eyes as to blind them from just how successful the economy has become.
#####
Yang doesn‚Äôt get to speak, but that‚Äôs ok, Ingram keeps digging her own hole of stupidity and arrogance. ‚ÄúHold on Andrew‚Äù, what a tool. Interrupting him. No wonder we have a complete moron in the White House, because morons listen to Ingram interrupt with nonsense.
#####
You can help or you can blame but you cannot do both.
#####
Her voice is horrid, it is loud and harsh like an old witch from Macbeth.
#####
She mentions giving money to the homeless. But he‚Äôs saying give money to everyone eligible. Straw Man fallacy. 

What would Laura do with $1000?
#####
Is he getting sick or did they mess up the audio?
#####
laura knows she can't go against yang's knowledge so she cuts him off lol
#####
She likes to hear the sound of her own voice
#####
Didnt trump gave a handout?
#####
$1000.00 a month...its CHIVAS REGAL TIME BABY and score me an 8 ball ...dildos and ball gags too...
#####
She comes across as an entitled bully. She just wants to hear herself preach the party line that is failing more and more regular Americans.
#####
Strange I have two degrees one in business administration and one in accounting and I have been unemployed since Trump took office. I have applied to over 7000 jobs in the past 3 years and every job I apply to has between 60-300 applicants. I also have over 8 years experience in jobs ranging from property management to personal assistant. Where are all these jobs the Republicans boast about? I have moved to 3 different cities to make sure it wasn't an isolated thing. The only job Ive managed to get is driving for uber and lyft.
#####
Laura, you're a small minded,  despicable person.
#####
And second your a liar your misleading you cannot be commander and chief
#####
laura does not deserve her life.
#####
This lady loves to hear her voice..
#####
Skipped to 6 random points on the video, 5/6 was Laura speaking....geez lady let the man speak
#####
My favorite part is when he starts talking about the real problems and she says "yea but this has been going on for 20 years or so" ....... yea great job at strong-arming an interview Laura, why even have people on? Let's all just ignore the issue because it has become a part of our everyday lives.
#####
I truly think Laura Ingraham has no problem with white people getting handouts, her fear in black people getting handouts.
#####
She sounds like she has a screwdriver in n her mouth
#####
She looks like a pack of ramen noodles
#####
Yang rocks
#####
The 1000 dollars a month isn't for the outlier of the drug addict or mentally ill homeless person, and other resources like funding housing options and food kitchens and Banks and access to mental and general health care, could help them more. The 12k a year is to help the people that work a full time job and still can't afford; still have to choose between housing and food much less healthcare or other basic human needs... Now it's great that your career is doing well, that your doing well; but for most Americans that is simply not the case.
#####
What an ignorant individual this woman is.,  Self opinionated, uneducated, judgemental,  negative human being.  Ask average Joe and his family what they could do with the money.  They way she props Trump makes one wonder if she lives in hope that he will grope her, or make her his next wife.
#####
If you don't want to feel embarrass or look dumb -- then think harder before speaking or doing foolish things. Just tells like it is.
#####
Think that white people need to wait till someone finish talking before cutting in like those ill-mannered people. Have their parent raise or teach them well behave before going out into the world and causes embarrassing to their parent's image?? Listen well before cutting in or interrupting someone who's still talking.
#####
Laura is a joke.
#####
How close minded can you get
#####
Can this women let him talk
#####
Laura is bs human being
#####
Yang's take down of laura's statistic was great.  The 2015 trump said, the numbers are fable now at office he swears by them.
#####
So digusting.  She thinks giving everyone a handout means no one will use that money for anything good.  Actually most people will take the $1k a month and build on it.  Buy more real estate, open more businesses, buy a guitar and play at the local bar, etc etc.
#####
I hope you fickin shut up and listen. What you know?
#####
Laura interviewed herself mostly.
#####
Yang is not going to do anything. Trump 2020
#####
Was she 8nterviewing herself?
#####
I wish he wouldn‚Äôt have let her railroad him at 3:15 when she said those statements about how homeless people would only misuse their dividends. before giving yang a chance to respond she redirects to a quote of his on trump. 

He just let her have the last word on that. 

She‚Äôs so masterful at framing and redirecting the conversation to fit her agenda it makes me sick tbh.
#####
Fox News supports only the Racist Party and American Traitors.
#####
If you want a job you can get a job... sky's the limit! ... hell, have three jobs, no benefits and still not enough to pay rent.
#####
Exactly when it was candidate trump the low unemployment and job growth numbers were fake news now those numbers are a great economy.  Lmfao
#####
Laura: Before you answer my question let me ask you another question on a different topic.  
Me: Let the man speak!!
#####
Yes why give money to the poor let's give it to rich or to big corporations maybe is because the Republicans only cater to the rich
#####
Compare how much time she spent blabbering... Versus yang.
#####
Oh don't call him a capitalist that will end his run.
#####
It's not right or left the way is forward Yang 2020 PLEASE listen with an open mind and let Andrew speak truth.
#####
Let the dude speak. Sheesh
#####
This is the leader this country needs; this is the thought leader the world needs! ^~^
#####
Andrew Yang is so incredibly Awesome!! Please help Mr. Yang win the nomination and then the election so he can help all of us when he is our President. The other candidates does nothing for me. I can't get enough of Yang videos.  I watched them all üôÇ. Andrew Yang wins 2020.
#####
Just when many thought all hope was lost....a unifier is delivered to us. If we were all responsible American citizens, then this is our responsibility and obligation to put this man into a position to make Americans think harder than ever before. If not, your too far gone to even care anymore. Good luck with that. Andrew Yang/2020 ...all in, 110% !!

We need someone with the Forward thinking of Yang in the White House!

I lived through the upbeat sixties as a hippie teenager.  Yang's movement gives me that ultra-positive first-in-a-lifetime feeling all over again. That burst of lets-do-this-together urging, that you share with like-minded, and know can be shared with the rest of Humanity.

Mark my words, Yang is the best candidate for the next president of  US, period. Yang is a problem solver and thinker, not a global trouble maker, he is a team player and inviting all teams (other nations) to work together in dealing with the future problems that this planet will face! Thank God for Yang!

Your precious Commiecrats ran Amazon out of New York,  so what's to stop them from running Amazon & others out of the US? And, once they're Gone, where's the money coming from for your $1 Trillion a year VAT and UBI?  You're going to tax them after they've moved their operations to another country? How is that? Next, I'm told that your $16 trillion green steal will pay for itself in 10 years. So, all or most of Soetoro's green companies went bankrupt, but the Deal will still, somehow, pay for itself. Why did the Steal get zero votes in the Senate, Zero, if it's such a great idea? I'm waiting. Could you please post your replies in a non-rant format? The more you rant, the less sense you make.

Old trains will terminate in the train yards.and the New high technology Train will run in every stations faster with  accuracy.AI American Intelligent for President.

He's soft on China because he's Chinese. He's only talking about China's "malfeasance" regarding IP, but what is his position on the South-China Sea?
#####
Here is the real problem, the top 3 in th race - Biden, Bernie, Warren will not quit the race. Each of them have hard core supporters especially Bernie that will not switch unless they drop out. Yang takes votes from all of them and need at least one of them to drop out..The delegates have to make up their mind - Yang only chance is to win the delegates over..
#####
God have give us USA a last chance of bring this  man   if we still dont wake up  that is it go yang

#####
Donald Trump could never say "You got nothing to loss!" again to his fans. Yes, they would loss a lot if they missed their last opportunity with Yang. Yang2020/2024!
#####
Finally a candidate that's thinking and making real changes, not deep in the pocket of corporations or lobbiest
#####
I am not American but I wish I can vote for him since I can‚Äôt I will pray tp God for him to be the next US President. After all I will be living and work in the states as a PT and I think I will be so happy living in the US knowing that he is the President.

#yangfor2020
#####
I am a lifetime Republican and a Trump voter. If, and I mean IF, I could be pulled across the aisle, Yang would be the only one that could cause me to make the big switch. He is really the only Democratic candidate making any sense right now. As a fellow tech industry guy, I realize that Universal Basic Income is inevitable. We have to have the foresight to bridge the gap between our current economic system and the post scarcity economy of the future.
#####
UBI is the shittiest idea any dumbfuck ever came up with. It clearly caters to losers of our society.

I haven't felt optimism in such a long time. Thanks, #YangGang . 

What you are saying about how the machine needs to work for us, not the other way around... it really feels like you are speaking from my soul. We need humanity to come first.

The money is not a gift. It's a dividend for corporate loyalty. We the people,  have supported corporate entities , which have no feelings, let's say it can't feel, Yang needs to be clear. We have the power , by we, i mean every consumer , look at how many corporate entities that you are loyal to, each of them have to have you, it's not the illuminati,  it's corporate, anyway Yang has opened a door that can't close...

Smart, funny, problem solver. Am I awake?

Andrew Yang and his supporters are very intelligent people. Why? With Andrew Yang you either get it or you didn‚Äôt, and probably never will but one thing for sure if Andrew win you too will be an American again stand head and shoulder above human being on planet earth.
#####
He stands on his own - this country needs hope and revitalization and smarts - Yang gives us that-

If you receive SSI you do not qualify for the freedom dividend. If you receive SSDI you are free and clear. Andrew Yang intends to take away the SSI social program. So you will not only be disabled but homeless. Because you must be disabled to receive SSI!!!

If you've been watching videos about Andrew and said you can't donate because you're broke just skip a lunch and donate one dollar. Your donation matters and so do you. If you still decide not to it is what it is. I mean it isn't like a TV personality would become... üò•"grab her by the pussy"
#####
I wish Mr. Yang would talk more about how he would have bale outs work.  In my opinion, all bale outs of banks, or corporations, should be done by paying off the little guys/gals loans, instead of just giving out money to the failing bank. It is NOT right to bale out a bank, then have said bank foreclose on the little guys/gals homes and businesses like what happened in the last few bank bale outs.  I think, a lot of people have an issue with that practice and would vote on just that issue. No, bank or corporation should receive a direct handout/welfare, without it decreasing the burden on the little guy first.  Let it trickle up, instead non-existent trickle down.
#####
Andrew yang policy will help more young people spend time in school, college and studying
#####
Andrew yang is best candidate for this modern century. His policy never see before.think about this if you are a full time worker and you receive 1k a month that will help a lot. Wealthy people don‚Äôt care. I think most people care

To get this 1000 a month is raise sales tax to 10 cents for every dollar. It is easier to calculate and if people with more money spend more they essential contribute in this sales tax. Legalize drug for contribute all of its sales tax to also contribute 1000 a month so whether you are on them or not it benefits all.
#####
Yang is an incredible moron! If there is that much money than there is zero excuse to ever cut Social Security a dime ever!  Let the free loader earn theirs like those before them. All this idiot would do is inflate the shit out of our money and destroy those that already earned their Social Security ! As the idiot didn't think to include them. Remember Democrats stole the social security  money to fund their Vietnam war!  There are plenty of unfunded liabilities . Without starting a free bee give away for those that didn't earn it!  Yang is an idiot! LOOKING FOR SUCKERS! And the inflation he would cause would make our money worthless. I am sure China would love this idiots plan. Maybe he works for them!

Okay, I am going to talk to the Yang gang. Andrew Yang will not be the candidate in 2020 no matter how much you donate. The dems and reps are terrified of him. He stands for change and the washington elite does not want change, they want business as usual. 
The ticket will be Biden/Warren. If you want Yang to be pres in 2024, then you need to vote Trump in 2020. If the B/W ticket wins in 2020 then Yang will never be pres,  America will fail and we will lose our democracy.
I didn't vote for Trump the 1st time but if Yang is NOT on the ballot then I will bite the bullet, hold my nose and vote for Trump. A vote for Trump in 2020 is a vote for Yang in 2024 and he will win by the biggest landslide ever(except for George Washington but he was a special case).
The good news is if we can swing the senate, and I am voting dem on every other issue and candidate, then the first order of business on the table with the new congress will be impeachment. 
A vote for Trump in 2020 is a vote for Yang in 2024.

#####
Awesome Video!
#####
Can this be a youtube ad???
#####
abolish the 16th amendment, except for corporations other than sole props. the IRS no longer audits income tax, it is strictly a salary tax for individuals.   institute VAT instead, and prohibit foreign based companies from bidding on US contracts, to avoid them paying US taxes
#####
Freedom dividend is the greatest idea in the history of politics.  Yang is the FUTURE!
#####
I support you Andrew Yang! #Yang2020
#####
I'll bet you $1000 a month that he'll win.
#####
All these other videos got this sad background music making me emotional and shit... this one got me HYPED ASF
#####
Yang2020......Yang is calling it as it is. "Trump is fat." Vote for Yang.
#####
The media shuts him off because he doesn't complain a lot about President Trump, like the other Dems do
#####
Americans, please, for the love of planet earth, vote for Andrew Yang!
#####
Lame
#####
Mr. Yang, I was interested in your novel policies especially your wealth giveaway, but you're obvious elitist attitude shaming overweight people is a non-starter for me. I want someone who will be an inclusive president not a divisive president based on physical ability and weight. I can now see your outlook is a bread and circus strategy.
#####
I never heard about him, how he can be more popular until 2020, I don't have any clue
#####
Wish I could vote for him however I'm 16 would I cant rip
#####
A fool and their money.
#####
You believe this garbage!!!  He works for China.
#####
It‚Äôs not fair... we want a Yang in England... but the slogan would be METH not MATH ‚òπÔ∏è
#####
Andrew Yang, pls put gun ban on your campaign, be bold! 

start from stop issuing new gun license, then stop trading guns even give away. 

and help gun manufacturers transform to machinery business, to make robots and AI products. 

make america people  happy and wealthy again.
#####
Also... The guy is an old school StarCraft player. #protoss
#####
Andrew Yang is the closest we got to Iron Man. A futurist with a vision. AI is a suit of armor around the world. Proceeding with great caution as Yang proposes is a must. He's a father so you know just like Tony, he would risk it all for his kids and our kids' future "I love you 3000" style. Tulsi Gabbard as VP Captain Marvel muscle assisting President Yang could end our Infinity Wars.

Humanity first. It wasn't Thor who defeated Thanos with a Snap. It was a human man embraced by a suit of iron.
#####
Trump was thought to be the first unconventional president of the U.S, clearly Yang is. His sincerity towards the people are of epic proportions. He's a good fit for the states, we hope you vote for him! - From Canada
#####
Go go Yang I will support you all the way love you from Eau Claire, WI.
#####
I voted for Trump and I like Andrew Yangs Views hes has my Vote! 
YANG GANG
#####
This is one of his best videos. It needs to go viral. Then everyone would vote for him.
#####
I wanna move forward not backwards into a cesspool of race issues! You got my vote!
#####
Feel the Yang!
#####
ANDREW YANG -- RICHARD OJEDA 2020. Time to put Trump's dick in the dirt and dare him to turn over. 
A wise businessman and a bad ass paratrooper combat veteran who made his way up through the ranks from Private to Major. Knuckle up, Trump! Here comes Yang and Ojeda!
#####
If This Man doesn't win the Primary's I swear there is no hope anymore
#####
I WOULD LOVE IT IF YANG SUPPORTERS WOULD STOP SHITTING ON OTHER CANDIDATES VIDEOS. IT MAKES YOU LOOK AS CRAZY AS TRUMP TROLLS. MAKES ME WONDER WHAT KIND OF A MAN ATTRACTS RABID FANS LIKE THAT.
#####
Yang Gang it is not left, not right but forward! Yang 2020! (never have I been so excited to support a presidential candidate before) (#Solutions#MATH)

Australia checking in. Got my MATH hat and T Shirt. This is the guy. America deserves this class of President. For the people.

Andrew yang is pretty cool. But the DNC will never allow him to be the Nominee.

Mr.Yang lets talk about how our children on the autism Spectrum will rule the future  .Mom of 2 boys on the spectrum with our communities broken because our townships have no little to no funds to help this crisis in our country . We need to help our children work towards a safer future than the one we are currently in. The Autism Spectrum is at a rise all over our country .

When will we see a revamp of the consumer protection agencies? The automakers are totally controlling the nhtsa and have been for some time. Help lower and middle class American's money go further. Good luck to Andrew Yang. Tons of things to fix in this country from the top position.
#####
Andrew Yang is the only reasonable option. Head and shoulders above all other candidates, whether on the left or the right. I voted for Trump in 2016. I was probably going to vote for him again, until I started hearing from Andrew Yang.
#####
hey Andrew how comes you never said ubi could use to pay off student loans
#####
YANG 2020 / FREEDOM DIVIDEND / M4A / Humanity First / Abundance Mindset / $1,000 per mo per adult / Solution to POVERTY = CASH in the hands of Parents and Teachers !!!        YANG = YES !!!
#####
I live in the bronx where the streets are littered with needles and sidewalks are crowded with dope heads nodding. 
People like that should NOT have access to a freedom dividend where they will buy drugs and continue down the same path they choose to live.
#####
I would hope that if the freedom dividend is put into place (which i am in support of) that there would be some kind of rules or stipulations for it. Like maybe you need a home address or a residence or something.
#####
I just want to know if the freedom dividend will apply for drug addicts and alcoholics.

I bet on him heavy at 100 to 1 right after Joe Rogan's Podcast.  Checked today and he's at 20 to 1.

They should call their PAC YangGang so it'll say "Paid for by the YangGang".

just dont take the guns you got me and a lot of others, also don't let 16 year olds vote
#####
Lol. Not a chance.
#####
Humanity First! For once im excited to vote

Andrew yang's comment about Israel was very disappointing he needs to better educate himself on this critical issues or seek advice from advisors/confidante in foreign policy before he losses his ever - increasing supports. Finally, I hope my message will reach to him ASAP

Yang needs to change his slogan. MATH doesn't work cause few Americans want to think harder.  It should be FAAA = Free Americans to Aspire Again. FAAA, the nice F word we can say to each other. FAAA, cause you know you want to!
#####
I voted for Trump in 2016. For the past year, I have been seriously searching for who to vote for in 2020. I've found him!!!! Andrew Yang for President!!!
#####
I like idea of UBI, but congress will not pass. If it passes, too expensive in the long run. Personal income taxes would go up. UBI could bankrupt America. Yang needs to share his plan on how he will create high paying jobs for the unemployed workers bcs 1000/month is not a living wage.
#####
I heard Gyna is funding this guy, I dont know man, sounds like treason.

8 months an still sendin people ta this video. It's so fuckin good.
#####
I only started listening to Yang because I thought his ideas were stupid. Never thought I'd become a Yang ganger.
#####
Sanders, Warren and Biden are all great candidates. But when they win, when one of them becomes president - you and me, the average American, who is just trying to find ways to make that extra buck, failing to get where we wanted to be  - all of that will still be the same. Nothing changes for you and me, not directly. But if Andrew Yang becomes president, and he sets up the Universal basic income - it could mean a tremendous change in my life and yours. That's 12,000 tax free dollars per year - which is almost close to the annual  median personal income of a working citizen. It might not be a big deal to those 'living comfortably', or the older folk now in their 40s and above, with almost no student loan debts to pay off. $1000/month will make a big difference in my life. I am sure it will make even a greater change in the lives of people who need it more than some of us, like the many we cannot help, those living on the streets, those who are starving. The people who live without having to worry about what happens at the end of the month, can easily have the luxury to argue about principles, the economy, how China is looting us, who is more snowflake and who is not. But for people who are young, who are struggling with our own problems - problems which could be solved at least partially if we need not have to worry about making enough to survive every week, Andrew Yang is HOPE! If we won't rally behind him now, we are going to lose this opportunity.
#####

How about you acknowledge the fact that your platform has a major contradiction.


Import cheap labor to do the "jobs that no one wants to do", when those jobs are going to be replaced with robots and automation.
You're perfectly fine bringing people in this country to do jobs that will be taken away from them in no time. 


Importing people to do jobs that will be replaced with robots is fucking stupid. 
But hey its cool, 1000 dollars a month, every month, for eternity is going to fix that.....right?
#####
Ok, I'll vote for Trump.

Is this an offbrand rich chigga? I like it.

I'm on the Yang Train. I'm older (56), but he's one of the few candidates in my lifetime that actually represents how I feel about things!

UBI = free market death 

For anyone unironically supporting UBI:  Instead of taking the shortsighted and lazy path of voting in politicians who promise (by threat of force) to rape all small business owners, why don't you simply acquire a marketable skill?








....oh..that right...it's work -_-
#####
The Freedom Dividend is not about money. It's about dignity for all Americans. These are normal people just trying to live a decent life.

This is exactly why I support Andrew Yang.
#####
1k permonth.   You know the homeless can start over.  Can leave the street. And get a fresh start. No more homeles. No more people stealing.  Crime rate goes down. People are happy.  Not because the money. But because the feeling that we have something
#####
Just donated my last dollars to Yang's campaign and i dont regret it at all
#####
Freedom Dividend works. It's one way on how we can all move forward. 
      Yang 2020.

UBI is not about money it‚Äôs about humanity and a way to save capitalism üß¢

This is so inspiring, I hope the Yang campaign can make a slew of these kinds of videos

Will you all vote for him as quick as you thumb up?
#####
Andrew Yang is a hero!!
#####
Why Cant he give a black family money
#####
Yang put the money where his mouth is. So each one of us Yang Gang supporters must form a Yang army in each community we live in. Mobilizing around towns and cities to bring Yang to the mass audience in America who still don't know his name yet. LET'S TAKE ACTION üí™ . Like Yang said, talk is cheap... whining, complaining, and crying do NO GOOD. Remember he is ASIAN and must work 10x harder my friends. I printed Yang for president fliers. Handing them out and posting them wherever I go. Go Yang Gang... God speed!!!üôèüôè
#####
I‚Äôm totally impressed with Yang I hope he becomes our president
#####
Yang campaign should run this as a Facebook campaign AD.
#####
He checked himself into a hospital... There goes the 12K lol
#####
Andrew yang! Walking the talk! This is what moved me even more.  I am truly inspired by Andrew.   Mainstream media needs to cover this instead of alienating his campaign.
#####
Freebies for everyone!  Who is going to pay for all of this cash given away to every person in America?  Do illegals get the money too, just like the healthcare, and college?  Everyone in the world will come here.  I like freebies too, but this is not sustainable.
#####
Dignity for one and all is what this is. That $1000 allows someone to get meds, to buy a decent pair of shoes for that job interview. Growing up poor I slept in the kitchen on a fold out canvass thingie. That $1000 could have mean a decent mattress and pillow. This was already tabled by other senior leaders in the 70s but now with rocketing prices this policy is needed more than ever.
#####
Taxing the rich definitely is WRONG, you might lose jobs but the business owners and big CEOs would lose everything ! They are the ones that take the most risk. This is going to kill America‚Äôs innovation
#####
My husband and I just finished registering as democratic to vote him in the primaries!
#####
Wow!! Americans have hope to change their lives.  Make him your president.  A visionary like no other.
#####
Wow look how Yang is destroying America here(sarcasm)
#####
This my guy of hope man..
#####
That is how UBI Freedom dividend would do.
Improve everyone's lives.
#####
for his household it be 3000 per month. 1000 for him, 1000 for his wife, and 1000 for his daughter (who has to be 18 to receive). 36 thousand dollars every year plus what ever they make on jobs
#####
When I hear about Andrew yang I‚Äôm crying because love Andrew yang!
#####
Now imagine this for EVERY American
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Vote for ANDREW YANG. Me too.
#####
I‚Äôm voting for $1,000 a month!
#####
Is this family getting 1k per every family member or just 1k total for the whole family as an experiment to showcase the idea?
#####
This is not going to make people lazy, it's going to inspire people to work harder because they are getting help.  Remember money is never enough, who's going to just sit on their ass trying to live off that 1k?  Me and my wife don't have kids, we both don't make that much at our jobs but we're ok because we don't have any kids.  I can't imagine what this extra 1k a month can do to families with kids that really need it.  It could do so much in every way.
#####
We need to get rid of the corruption first . Amazon and other businesses would find a way to turn the UBI into a monthly debt instead of a profit . We need to first address the reasons people are not able to live on what they make . Big Corporations would raise prices on goods and services , you bet your ass they will . I'm not against UBI but we need to stop the problem . When the bully is taking your lunch money your parent(s) don't give you more money . You knock that motherfucker right in the mouth !!!

This really needs more views!
#####
So this family should be getting 3k a month, Mom, dad and daughter?
#####
I'm really happy for this family :)
#####
Andrew has the solution.
#####
A 1000$ month would keep me off the streets and I would be able to afford my own place. I‚Äôm a 26 years old millennial and work two shitty part times jobs that don‚Äôt pay a living cause of that I‚Äôm forced to live with my parents because the job market sucks, nobody is training anyone to fulfill job roles without ‚Äú 2 years of work experience masters degree preferred for entry level work‚Äù and full time jobs are scarce almost as if they are imaginary people with degree‚Äôs are taking up all the ‚Äúentry level work‚Äù so I was forced to just take what I can get which meant anything that was offered to me. Andrew Yang has my 2020 vote
#####
Obama was like the black dad that was never there but showed up during the birthday parties and gave the best speeches saying all the right things and taking photos with everyone but once the party was over he bounced and left the kids to clean up the mess

Hillary was like the evil step mum who tried to win the kids over in order to get the Dad‚Äôs money but one of the smart kids found out about her master plan in an email that she unwittingly sent using the home laptop and was subsequently kicked out of the house

Trump is like the overbearing controlling white dad who meant well but was overly strict, who built a wall around the house to prevent his daughter from dating that Mexican guy next door who he deemed a bad influence

Yang will be the chill dad who tries to be hip and cool but comes off goofy, who listens to your problems and never imposes anything on you, and on top of that, giving you $1000/month just because he loves you

As jobs become less secure, pay less, and prices go up, more Americans are simply struggling due to the greed. It is unreasonable for only one half of the system to change. The rich are getting super-mega-ultra-filthy rich at the expense of the worker. When a CEO fails, he gets a $100 million golden parachute, even if his failures result in the death of the company. Meanwhile, a worker can make one small mistake that has relatively little impact, and be shown the door with nothing. 


The higher-ups are already engaging in wealth distribution, in the form of things like signing bonuses and golden parachutes.


We're already tried "trickle-down," which does not work, because the wealthy just horde it and lock it down into tax havens. That said, I think the "trickle-up" approach of UBI will work. Hard-working Americans who are barely getting by will be putting this back into the economy, and effectively *_back into the pockets of the wealthy._* This means they should have no reason to complain about this. 


They're not going to be less wealthy because the people who made them wealthy can now afford to go to the doctor, eat better, or have a more healthy life. It does not harm them at all.

I must first say that it is tremendously impressive that a candidate puts his money where his mouth is to demonstrate an idea he believes in. I do however, wish the family would have been encouraged to be more concrete in sharing how the Freedom Dividend has helped them so far - we need them to *show* its on the ground impact, not reiterate the 30k ft talking points of the platform. 


To be clear, I'm not saying beneficiaries of the Dividend ought to "air their dirty laundry" - they owe us nothing and deserve the dignity of privacy, but the campaign's message may resonate with more people if the video were less abstract.

I think to get a more accurate result of the outcome of the Freedom Dividend, you should give it to me....üòÅ


But to be honest, you can't just pick and choose a family for the Freedom Dividend to showcase this example. You have to do split tests on all socioeconomic sectors of society and tax brackets in society. You have to give the Freedom Dividend to 1) someone who is not able to work; 2) someone who is unwilling to work; 3) someone who makes up to $9,525; 4) someone who makes $9,526 to $38,700; 5) $38,701 to $82,500; 6) $82,501 to $157,500; 7) $157,501 to $200,000; 8) $200,001 to $500,000; 9) $500,001 or more.

I feel that this example does not reflect the overall picture of who The Freedom Dividend will cover. It's a bit misleading to say the least.

Fucking Badass!

I am so down with this movement..

Scarcity brings out the worst in people, it's just human nature...and scarcity hasn't been this prevalent in this country since the Gilded Age...and it will be much worse WHEN automation displace millions of more workers in the near future. The FreedomDividend is the only solution with enough upside to help manage the future economy we're rapidly heading towards.
#####
Yang is a bigot. A few weeks ago he as talking to a group of Asian Americans telling them that in one generation they would be just like Jews in the US and that they would be targeted by some white male shooter in their place of worship. His meaning was clear that is that Asians in the US would be rich and powerful like Jews in the US and therefore targeted by some angry white guy. It is his primary motivation for the thousand dollars per month per citizen that he his pushing. He worries about the millions of white guys who will become unemployed do to automation.
#####
Andrew and his campaign are so much more than the $1000 per person. He really understands what America is going to be facing soon and for that, he has move vote (and donations). I liked this video, just wanted to see the father look at the camera a bit more. Looking forward to the Town Hall on CNN tonight!

Thank you Yahweh 4 AY and the Test run for this lovely family, I pray is success to be the 2020  President Elect.

If CNN and the media don't allow Andrew a chance to win and save humanity, then our society is truly in deep trouble with huge problems.
#####
Good luck 2nite on CNN Townhall Andrew!  Be yourself, keep your cool, u're gonna kill it. Represent brother!
#####
Wow, nice video!! Really powerful to hear personal testimonials...thanks for sharing!
#####
What is refreshing about Yang is ... it is not a right or left thing with him... it is help to all,... it is a forward thing....if trump watches this town hall tonight ... he will scream SOCIALISM!... but if Yang gets good responses from the audience.... trump will steal the idea and claim UBI for all .... if i win in 2020... same as he is doing on healthcare... hopefully people will not fall for it...Funny how the right call it socialism .... but can't tell you one program they came up with to help the american people... still waiting on the great healthcare plan... what has it been now? going on 3 years?...

I make 65k and an extra 12k would be huge really. I survive fine but I would be able to help out some family members more, and save for a new car or vacation

This is wonderful, except, I really dislike that the bumper sticker came out "Humanity First". I think loving one's neighbor is probably the most meaningful thing we can do here, but I feel uncomfortable with that order of precedence. I believe it should be God First, Humanity As Well - or something like that. Obviously poverty alleviation is a huge issue, maybe even a causal factor in almost all human ills, this is obviously why Jesus said "the love of money is the root of all evil". But I don't think we'll ever get there without also putting God first, and the rest of the commandments. Still, out of the available candidates, this seems to be the most Christian option in action. Still, there is something missing.

Yep.... I have never donated to a campaign in my life at age 69.....I am DEFINITELY DONATING TO ANDREW YANG ..... PRESIDENT ANDREW YANG 2020 GOTTA  ((((( LOVE )))) THIS MAN <3

Yang put the money where his mouth is. So each one of us Yang Gang supporters must form a Yang army in each community we live in. Mobilizing around towns and cities to bring Yang to the mass audience in America who still don't know his name yet. LET'S TAKE ACTION üí™ . Like Yang said, talk is cheap... whining, complaining, and crying do NO GOOD. Remember he is ASIAN and must work 10x harder my friends. I printed Yang for president fliers.

Ok so let's really think about this for a bit.  What will businesses do when everyone has an extra $1000/mo to spend?  Raise prices, obviously.  When virtually every company takes advantage of all the extra money that's now out there, your grocery bill doubles, your utility bills double, virtually all prices go up.  (It wasn't that long ago that a value meal at McDonald's was $2.99...now it's over $6.  Watch what happens when EVERYONE is given $1,000/mo out if thin air). All of a sudden, the $1,000/mo UBI is only worth $500.  So everyone gets upset and it then gets raised to $2,000/mo just to have the same effect.  So prices go up even further.  In the meantime, the life savings of the middle class literally gets chopped in half ($100,000 in the bank can only buy $50,000 worth of stuff in today's dollars because the price of everything has already at least doubled).  This is basic economics...you CANNOT create wealth out of thin air like that.  This will have disastrous consequences for the economy and especially responsible middle class savers.  No thanks, Yang.  I like some of your other ideas, but UBI will ruin us all.
#####
""VOTE for YANG."" HE IS NOT A PUPPET OF LOBBYIST.
----------------------------------------
DO NOT VOTE FOR LOBBYISTS FUNDED CANDIDATES. THEY WILL DO WHAT THE LOBBYISTS ASKED THEM TO DO LIKE, ""FORGET ABOUT FREE HEALTHCARE, AND THIS  AND THAT, FORGET UBI, INSTEAD WE GIVE THEM FREE COUPONS...PEOPLE WILL LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF MONEY.""  Most of the Democrat candidates accepted money from lobbyists. Now, they are the puppets and will obey what the lobbyists told them to do.***** AND THAT IS NOT GOOD.
#####
the only democrat i respect. hes not scared to debate right wing people and have a civil conversation.

I‚Äôd vote üó≥ for Yang but before I have to know if UBI is actually sustainable.

Give this man donations and also share these video on social media so people friends and family can see for themselves how dope this guy is!!

Love Yang. But how do his outstanding ideas ever become law with the slime we have in Congress. Nothing with life can grow there.

I like Andrew Yang but I also like the Wall since I live in CA. Not trying to be mean-- I tried driving in San Jose where strip malls are and every 4th driver was a handy man construction truck driver  at break neck speed for no apparent reason. I was praying to find the highway exit. I grew up there and it is drastically different than when I grew up.  G-d help all of us. I love them but we need discernment.

Andrew yang must be more assertive if he wants to jump from tier 3 to tier 2 or 1. They aka the establishment media and elites already have their money and support behind buttgegag and biden.

I like him but he follows a script uses the same sentences to answer questions (crowd phycology). The same sentences he uses in his speeches. And the fact he wants to get ride of min wage. Everything else I like. But we all know what corporations do when they can get away with it. This is also why we have min wage laws and child labor laws. He never talks about that. He had my vote untill I saw he was against a min wage.

1) Porque propone esto? Pq dice que en los proximos 5 anos miles de de trabajos se perder√°n a causa de la automatizaci√≥n. Ya se estan perdiendo. En los estados que Clinton deberia haber ganado, y que Trump gano, muchos trabajos se perdieron a causa de la automatizaci√≥n. No es coincidencia que gan√≥ en esos estados. 2) Como se pagara? Ahora, las corporaciones pueden terminar pagando nada en impuestos porque el IRS impone impuestos a las ganancias, y son faciles de esconder. Yang un sistema  de impuestos llamada value added tax (VAT), donde se le aplica impuestos a cada transacci√≥n. De esta manera, compa√±√≠as tienen que pagar impuestos. 3) El problema es que ya no va ser como antes. Aunque seas buen trabajador, perderas tu trabajo porque tu no podras contra una computadora que es mas inteligente, que no duerme, i que no no requiere un saldo. No podemos dejar a tantas personas sin alguna forma de ayuda.

Andrew Yang quiere un ingreso b√°sico universal porque estamos experimentando el mayor cambio tecnol√≥gico que el mundo haya visto. Para 2015, la automatizaci√≥n ya hab√≠a destruido cuatro millones de empleos de fabricaci√≥n, y las personas m√°s inteligentes del mundo ahora predicen que un tercio de todos los estadounidenses que trabajan perder√°n su trabajo a la automatizaci√≥n en los pr√≥ximos 12 a√±os.

No se si entendi bien. Al final hasta pagaremos mas q lo que podriamos recibir. Todo lo que compremos subira de precio. Los q ganarian son los q menos consumen. Pero si no compramos pagando ese nuevo impuesto no habra dinero para cumplir su promesa. Entonces seria una ahorro porq nos cobraran mas por lo que compremos y nos devolveran 1.000 dolares. Cuanto aumentara el costo de todo?

The best thing about Yang is the fact he doesn't insult our intelligence. He doesn't tell us to believe in what he says, but believe in what we can see with our own eyes. Then he provides his solutions on how he changes the course of what we are feeling in our guts. There is no putdowns and there is no showmanship. There is just his sincerity in helping the country, and the world, become a better place for the current and many future generations. Yang Gang all the way!!!

#####
Yang is a Trojan Horse of neoliberalism.  Yang seems to attract the weak minded that can't sort out his dog whistles, and his libertarian BS.
#####
I still remember the time I lost all of my money while I was waiting 6 months for unemployment to tell me I didn't qualify, never again do I want that to happen to anyone.
#####
Yang will not be President in 2020 since he will not get the senior vote primarily because his UBI seems to discriminate against seniors in the respect that workers receive wages and when opted-in will receive the UBI added to their wages. In contrast seniors receiving Social Security, the majority cannot opt-in since benefits are more than the UBI. It seems discriminatory since seniors should be able to opt-in, get the UBI, and keep their benefits which are much lower than wages even minimum wage in comparison. Therefore, it seems doubtful Yang will get the millions of votes which seniors represent‚Ä¶..

He has got my vote, and donation! First for both.

He may be great n ideal to be President but his biggest hurdle , I think, is that America is not ready to accept an Asian leading them. Sad but it‚Äôs reality, race still plays a part in everyday lives. Powerful Media will slaughter him by not giving him the reel time.

Andrew Yang is a very smart guy; he has very creative ideas to optimize efficiency & solve many of the problems facing the average people. I hope he does well as the primaries progress & more people get the chance to learn what he calls for. If he doesn‚Äôt win the primaries, he should definitely be considered for a top position. For example, can you imagine him (with his creative financial background) in charge of HUD (Department of Housing & Urban Development) instead of (Trump‚Äôs pick: Ben Carson) the empty shell incompetent clueless goofball running it today? Yang would transform the highly rigged mortgage industry that exists today to actually help average people meet their housing needs without having to struggle & without being ripped off by the predatory mortgage banks that write their own laws that are supposed to govern them. Andrew Yang üëç

I like that he's a Problem = Solution person.  Yang seems to be the only one with a solid plan, with an outline of how he plans to achieve it. Most Reps and Dems are to busy hating each other to get anything done. Yang, You've got my vote!
#####
Andrews peppering of identity politics makes me lol.
#####
He‚Äôs the only one that knows the truth, the only one saying it, he‚Äôs done the math
#####
Andrew Yang will be President of the United States. I just hope it‚Äôs in 2020
#####
A visionary. I‚Äôm not used to seeing that in our dumb politicians.

Andrew Yang; a man with a forecast of the future who sees tuff weather ahead and want's to brace America for the coming storm.  No one has revealed this eventuality except for Andrew and alerted us of its unequivocal devastation.  It is only fitting that he takes the helm and navigate the ship.  Andrew Yang; commander and chief of the United States of America.  Has a nice ring to it".

I've been so depressed and cynical about the world and the people in charge of it for so long. I just assumed humanity was going to eat itself. Yang is the first reason I've had to be optimistic in forever.

Never felt so happy to vote for a presidential candidate before. President Andrew Yang 2020. Let's pull together and make this happen üí™

Please talk about the middleman cost of US healthcare!
#####
Yang needs to clarify how seniors receiving Social Security will benefit from Freedom Dividends because it sounds like Social Security would be treated the same as a monetary welfare benefit rather than as a retirement income from work.  How is that fair?
#####
How about $2000 per month? (he mentions a previous plan for $30 K in today's income...that's more workable, frankly).

22:00 "GDP driving us off cliff!  We need right measurements for how well we are doing!"  Oh my God, I can't believe a candidate is saying this!  I can't believe we might actually have a president who thinks this way!
#####
The point is that tariff revenues are a tax on American economy 
(households and firms), and these tax revenues collected by the U.S. 
Federal Government are not enough to cover compensation to the U.S. 
farmers for their losses due to China's retaliatory tariffs. Agrifood 
commodities are a buyers market: soybeans are sourced globally, traded 
globally and their prices are set globally. When China imposes tariffs 
on imports of soybeans from the U.S., the Chinese consumers do not pay 
the tax on their purchases of these, instead they substitute by 
purchasing readily available soybeans from other parts of the world. On 
this, see:¬†https://trueeconomics.blogspot.com/2019/05/14519-agent-trumpovich-fails-to-deliver.html.
 Brazilian farmers win, American farmer lose. Uncle Sam subsidises U.S. 
farmers to compensate, using tax revenues it collected from the American
 consumers of Chinese goods.



But farming lobby is strong in the U.S. Thus, total quantity of 
compensation awarded to the farmers in now in excess of total tax 
revenues collected from the American consumers. It's a 
lose-lose-and-lose-some-more proposition of economics of trade.

Yang Knows the Law, he understands technology, and has real knowledge in economics!

He is the one with more chances to beat Trump!
#####
56:40 What I'd like to see from farmers/agriculture is with UBI we can make USDA certified organic the popular choice. Since people can afford the higher cost. The higher cost is actually because government subsidies exist to benefit farms that use chemicals provided by corporations like Monsanto. But produce is actually more beneficial without the use of pesticide and fungicides, as they kill phytonutrients and indirectly cause cancer.

Why is the penguin calling Andrew Yang, "Mr. YanK." There's a big ass sign behind him that clearly says "YANG."

$1,000/month could actually allow the working class to live in most cities in California lol.
#####
16:50 "What would you do with $1000?" 
I'd buy an electric bike that I've been wishing for, for the past 3 years but could never afford. I commute everywhere by bicycle 6 days/wk, but there are a lot of hills in this town which puts a lot of stress on my body. That $1000 electric bike would last a decade easily and make it a lot easier to get around town. Not to mention it's environmentally friendly.

What I'm worried about though is with businesses inflating their prices immediately after this takes effect. Especially with limited supply, high demand items that are expensive, like my electric bike. So that $1,000 bike would immediately jump to $5,000. And 5 months later when I have $5,000, the price will have jumped to $10,000. And so on...

When is he goin to make a new speech lol?

In taiwan, a family of 3 pay $100usd a month for universal healthcare, that‚Äôs what Andrew yangs parent was talking about. And the craziest thing are, the hospital are so good & efficient, and yet, it‚Äôs so cheap.. American health care system is a joke
#####
...Andrew Yang has created a Dizzying list of more than 100+ policies !!!!,....and the number is growing and growing....hundreds by 2020....? ; among those policies are medicare for all, the UBI, the paid family leave, $100 vouchers for all Americans to donate to nonprofits, reviving earmarks to make bills easier to pass, hiring a White House psychologist, legal marijuana, geoengineering to fight global warming, etc ...etc....etc...some of his policies seem to be grounded in Math. and data.... 
Andrew Yang began his Presidential Campaign on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic Primaries. Yang says his campaign is about facts, solutions, and people....but the real fact is that ...after "18 months" of Presidential Campaign....!, his great Town Halls, interviews, rallies, speeches, after so much Media attention, there is no doubt Yang has become a very well known presidential candidate these days...but now on May 2019, he averages "only" 0 to 1 percent in Nationwide Public Opinion Polls.... 
Andrew Yang has no shortage of things to talk about, he dreams Big !!!!....but Political History, Reality, and Pragmatism have always shown us that Math. and good intentions not always give such a huge number of ideas and policies the chance of being carried out and accomplished successfully for so many reasons.... they become very often a fiction novel, not a real platform......

..." Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be "...... ( A. Einstein ).
#####
Yang is for NOW....what was, was good...now it's time for "what is" ...forward, no need for looking back...
#####
One thing I don‚Äôt like is that he‚Äôs in favor of the electoral college. I get it, he‚Äôs got to appease to those states with the current system, but damn. üôÑ

Wrong Yang!  Illegal immigrants are getting freebies paid for by the legal American tax payer! What is your stance on illegals invading America?
#####
If yang likes Obama,  I wouldn't vote for him.  How do we know he is not a plant by the Dems?  
What is his stance on illegal immigrants?  Will he reconsider abortion?  And ban it?
#####
I like that yang wants to do the UBI but yang is for abortion and that is murder.
#####
You say you want to give every adult 1k no questions asked. Then you proceed to ask them how much they currently receive to get by with government assisted program money. To see whether people can qualify. Or opt in and lose their assistance. Then you proceed to ask the elderly retiree how much they receive in social security and maybe even their retirement benefits? What about those with pensions? And proceed to not allow them to opt in because they exceed 1k.

I thought you said this policy was called the freedom dividend. I thought everyone gets it no questions asked. We will all forever be Americans who majority want to support our local businesses and communities. So I think this idea was a good idea until I listened to a lot of your videos. You say this will remove the stigma of inequality if everyone gets it. But that is not true. You have clarified there is an opt in option and requirements to so call qualify. That in itself leaves room for stigmatization to grow and bubble among and between the rich, elitist, middle class, and the poor. The more I dissected it I realized the hard truth. You are not telling the entire narrative. Your telling your own, and left these specific and very important details out of your speeches. Is it intentional or unintentional? But I actually like you better now. You are human after all and not some prophetic savior or robot. You are a hypocrite, but like most hopefully good willed and unintentional.

I just think you should tell the whole truth around your main focal policy of your campaign. We are all Americans like you say. We should all benefit from taxing big tech. So please review your policy and remove the marginalization of any American from your Freedom Dividend. 

This includes the Native American who already receive reparations. This includes current Alaskans who benefit from current state incentives.

You should be taxing big oil market to make up for the government assisted money savings. They are building the pipeline to streamline and increase oil delivery and efficiency. There goes another trillion dollar market area who is using AI and human alternatives to increase profits and pay little to no taxes year after year after year...

Thanks.
#####
i like the UBI for all, but seniors should not be made to choose between UBI and their soc. security...soc. security is not welfare benefits, ..seniors work all their life and pay into a sort of pension plan and the govt. promise to give you SS ..so if millionaire bill gates is given UBI, so should all seniors ...without conditions and certainly not forced to choose between UBI and SSecurity--- does yang know that SS uis not welfare ?

Change is scary. Folks want change but when it is presented it's either fight or flight. 

Yang is rational and even as someone who voted red in 2016, I see yang being one of the best things that could happen to the American people.

I think he originally said the 1000/month would be up to the age of 64 but I think now he is proposing to have it be for life. Which makes sense because many seniors do not have enough to retire on.

Read through Yang's policies and consider giving the campaign a boost by making a small donation at yang2020.com . Math and humanity 2020!

I think Yang is the 21st century candidate. Other candidates keep doing the same thing like fighting, out-of-reality but not understanding & solving the problems.
#####
I like when news outlets try to call him "internet" famous like it's nothing. It's been all about the internet for over a decade now. Get with it, oldies.
#####
Andrew Yang is full of crap. Regardless of how automation impacts the jobs market, more jobs have been lost to China and India in the last 30 years. The myth that automation kills jobs as been around since the first industrial revolution in 1820 - automation got rid of textile workers...then there were automobile workers...automation cut those down then there were the household appliances jobs, automation killed those then there were smart phone and Ipad manufacturing jobs....history shows that innovation will always create new jobs even as technology advances. But automation didn't kill our jobs today,Chinese Indian Mexican and Brazilian factories did. The jobs we lost in America were not replaced by factories full of robots and AI in California...these jobs went to Shanghai and Mumbai...they are THERE right now. So unless Yang can tell us how to beat China and India, how to be more competitive and innovative, he's useless as President of USA.

I've heard some people say "but he's not a politician". So? he knows exactly how to solve americas biggest problems. The last thing we need is another regular lying politician, the ones that are already in positions of power and just lie to get the vote then do absolutely nothing to better the country. I feel like whats holding people back is that he is too "new" BUT LOOK AT HIM, he's so intelligent and answers every question clearly and concisely, what other politician does that? Bernie Sanders is great too but it look like Andrew Yang will everything he wants to do and more. This man is genuine and wants to better people's lives, you can see how sincere he is when he gives examples.
#####
i am 90% sure that he is actually going to become president and unless someone better runs for president, he's going to be president for 8 years and absolutely transform america. Then other countries will start to follow and the word will rapidly become a better place.

you know, i'm from Thailand, and we had a candidate whom was similar or just like YANG, he was also young, has all the solutions to our problems such as corruptions etc and he technically almost won the elections and had lots of seats in the parliament, but eventually still lost to the military elected pm. Maybe we are not as lucky. But In America you guys do not have the same problem as we do "Military" so if you guys give him a chance i believe it would be the best decision for your country and the humanity.
#####
Yang singlehandedly brought 21st century issues to the ongoing political discourse in the US. 
   He is the only candidate who understands and offers solutions to both old problems and 21st century challenges we are all facing. 
     That's the reason why he is drawing larger and larger crowds in his rallies/ meetings as well as generating lots of campaign donations from average americans. 
     This guy will win it.

$3.144 Trillion actually per year: we are talking about 262,000,000 people(via 2017, including 16 and 17 yr olds -> who are now 18 and 19) x 12,0000. Then, he wants Universal Medicare, Climate change(debunked as cyclical -> the cycles happen no matter what and those pics and videos of emaciated animals as a result of climate change were hoaxes by those that support it, Nye is a hack, and Thunberg was ispired by climate change enthusiasts, as well), and so many more programs that have to be paid for! He has so many programs that we'd likely be $6T or more every year!  

Reagan said, THE NINE WORDS THAT HE HATES: I AM THE GOVERNMENT AND I AM HERE TO HELP! THE REASON: THE COMPLETE CONTROL! ALSO, HE WARNED US ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT GETTING IN OUR LIVES BACK IN 61 AND 64, SO THIS KIND OF GOVERNMENT PUPPETMASTERY SYSTEM ISN'T A NEW PROPOSAL AT ALL! IT'S JUST BEEN REJECTED MOST OF THE TIME! THEY ALWAYS TRY TO TRICK YOU BY SHOWING THAT IT CAN WORK IN SOMEWHERE LIKE ALASKA AND MAYBE IT CAN FOR A LIMITED TIME OR UNTIL THEY WANT TO "RULE"! FUNNY HOW HE SAYS OR IT IS SAID, "NO STRINGS ATTACHED", BUT UBI OR SOCIALISM, EITHER ONE, GIVES THE GOVERNMENT YOUR STRINGS!

I PLEAD WITH YOU; DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON INCREASED GOVERNMENT AND HAVE AN OPEN MIND ABOUT WHAT IS BEING SAID!

THEN, THERE'S THESE THINGS:

A. Yang only supported things
1. Change the voting age to 16?!
2. His removal of the penny; would this coin go onto a card perhaps?! This would move us to a cashless society! Chipped?! -> After all, the technology exists for this mark of the beast today! This was predicted millenia ago!
3. Under UBI control, freedom of speech and religion would go away! B5st9ality, p5doph9lia, and other taboo laws can become edicts! A system of puppetmastery can be set up to have needs met--if they will bother to meet them at all. If they don't meet them, then you are scurrying about like a stray dog or cat! America would be ready to be either ruined or grafted into the new world order(Bush 1, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Obama, Albert Pike, etc)

B. Yang has these things in common with every Dem leader:
1. LGBTQ+ upon in6an*s and ch9ldr5n: p5n9ses get cut off and g9rls can become sterile, too! Guys can also become sterile through the hormone use, as well as having their member cut off. Parents or the ch9ld can have this done to the child! Many want to detransition, but now their voice and their look much more resembles the opposite sex from which they were born! B9s5xuals, p1ns5xuals, and trans people HIDE  their sexual orientation or preference OFTEN from heterosexual only men and women to get these people to have sex with them!  At the same time as these things, gay rape, gay statutory rape, and gay incest are all apart of this movement! These things lead to deep depression, suicide, insanity, HIV/HPV, etc. Then, natural g9rls get EASILY and UNFAIRLY outcompeted in sports! Last, you're alright with grown men or older ch9ldren being in the bathroom with your little g9rls just because they want to be woman today or lying to be granted access to a g9rl/woman location where there are no cameras! THIS EXPLAINED IS THE LGBTQ+ MOVEMENT! WHY SUPPORT THIS, WHEN THAT'S WHAT IT IS?! 

2. Meaningful guns gone; you must really trust the government?! Plus, they want unchecked immigration, which includes radical islam(EMP and rebel threat), terroristic groups/gangs(rebels would treat citizens as the spoils of war), and criminals will run amuck! Listen, not all immigrants are that, but some are and they would be a HUGE problem!

3..ABORTED B1B9ES DO FEEL ALL OF THE PAIN OF THE ABORTION; AN ABORTION DEFECTOR TESTIFIED TO THAT! AND, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BY NOW, IT CAN HAPPEN AT 9 MOS NOW! YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT DEAD B1B9ES WIND UP IN OUR VACCINES!!!!!! CAN YOU SAY AGENDA?!

SO, IT'S NOT JUST THE UBI, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE AS WELL! PLEASE LISTEN TO REASON! WHY VOTE THIS WAY?!

Either Yang or may be Pete Puttibeig . Young n smart and open to learn n adapt to strategies with best results around the world. It's like picking a newest smart phone young guys vs old n outdated flip phones old guys.
#####
2 HUGE problems with Yang's ideas.  1.  PEOPLE, ie the status quo ARE the ones who buy and support all the big businesses, REGARDLESS of how businesses are run.  This isn't the Civil Rights Era where people will stop using the bus because of their policies like the Montgomery bus boycott.  This isn't India where everyone will stop using salt from an unjust country.  EVERYONE in America is satiated by video games, movies, random entertainment, and things to buy.  AND those things are all from the companies that make money for the few rich people who DO NOT want to live by any types of humanist system Yang preaches.  So the MAJORITY of Americans support the system the way it is.  It takes education to not do so, and in general I dont' even know 1 person who watches documentaries on important topics and reads books.  Instead people watch sports, play video games, read fiction, and other entertainment so they are NOT educated on what and where to buy things, what to support and what not to.  2.  He is spouting ideas that ARE NOT capitalist ideas so he needs to stop confusing capitalist policies with his own humanist policies and RENAME what he's talking about.  It IS NOT capitalism in the purest form so rename it.
#####
I heard he wants to touch the military budget.
Until now the election only concern regarding 40% budget. It seems like the military allowed it as long as not touching the 60% budget.
The military is such powerful force.
How is he going to fight such force?
And how much?
#####
Legitimately.. I will cry is this man is not the democratic nominee

Most politicians are prostitute to the rich,  time for change vote for yourself and
 the real and only Yang.

Finally someone with substance and vision, this man has my vote %200

Get the boots off of people's THROATS.

This interviewer was terrible. She sounded almost illiterate. WTF Nevada?
#####
Oof yang is losing his touch. I think he's replacing confidence in the American people to confidence in himself. It's a small change in his behavior, but it's evident. It's like he's just playing the words from his mouth like a record player. Idk if I'm reading too much into it
#####

istg if he doesn‚Äôt win I‚Äôm going to throw myself off a cliff. I miss the voting age by FOUR MONTHS. I wish they had some law in place about like 6 months until 18 can vote too? Cause so many Gen Zers who aren‚Äôt of voting age would vote for him.
#####
HEY FELLOW YANG GANG. PLEASE SEE THE{ HACK} , ON NETFLIX. SO WE CAN LEARN NEW TACTICS THIS IS WHAT GOT TRUMP ELECTED AND WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AGAIN.

I like how he talks directly to the person who asked the question.
#####
Give me $1k a month and I still go to work. It is not enough! I can put it to saving or pay off my debt like student loans.

Peter Schiff does an excellent job of debunking this nonsense. Please take the time to listen to why these socialist ideas are complete rubbish. You can't spend your way to prosperity. If printing money were the solution it would have worked in Venezuala, Argentina, Zimbabwe and Germany and it clearly didnt.

Yang has a MLK flavor in his leadership.

Really! Americans right now don't know what an opportunity they have with voting for Andrew Yang......if you believe he can get the Freedom Dividend passed through congress then get him in the White House!!!
#####
YEAH  ,FORWARD  over a CLIFF!!   TRUMP 2020
#####
I am with you too Andrew Yang!! You are an American I can be proud to support with all my heart.
#####
With the "Freedom Dividend" it won't be destruction of jobs.......it will be freedom from jobs.  We will still work and keep busy but it will be what you were born to do and life will be excellent.
#####
I think it is such a great message . This policy acknowledges progress has been from countless immeasurable contributors of past and present. It allow all to share and enjoy the fruits of progress and not be left behind. Honouring humanity as we progress. It's a Great step forward in our consciousness. Well done for taking it to an election!
#####
thank u for using the FOX clip. andrew is always on FOX speaking to the opposite side. meanwhile he doesnt go around telling people like Pete.
#####
When America sneezes the whole world catches a cold.  Andrew is the only person to stop this from spreading and make society recover.
#####
Andrew Yang is a tireless visionary who clearly understands and offers solutions to both old problems and 21st century challenges we all face today. 
    Yang will change not only the US but also the rest of the world.
#####
Dear God please help Andrew Yang be our next president. We are being squeezed out by the rich and government. We have worked hard we deserve to live with dignity. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª

MSM CNN etc. are going to continue to ignore our Mr. Yang. That is why we have to GO VIRAL ourselves for the Freedom Dividend.

What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.

If we the people don‚Äôt step up now and vote this man into the White House, Another 4 years of this self proclaimed messiah is going to take this nation and the world into the darker realms of hell on earth. He‚Äôs is absolutely correct to self proclaimed himself as the messiah or ‚ÄúThe Chosen One‚Äù He‚Äôs chosen by the devil himself. Trump is the devil in the flesh. Please vote for Andrew Yang, for us and the world. The whole world is depending on us.

This is the first time I have supported and donated money to a campaign! Andrew Yang makes so much sense!

@Andrew Yang for President 2020, you guys should mention Professor Yuval Noah Harari. People need to read his book too.

Biden just announced today that he‚Äôs running! We have to make sure he doesn‚Äôt win the nominee! Keep spreading the message about Andrew Yang to your friends and family and post these videos on your social media to convince people to support Yang!

#ADOS are a group with a specific justice claim. The #ADOS movement demands a specific agenda with policy prescriptions that address the losses stemming from the institution of slavery, Jim Crow, redlining, convict leasing, mass incarceration and immigration. 
Without specific measures being instituted, #ADOS are locked out of the country our ancestors built during chattel slavery. Without reforms through transformative government, we will be left to continue living a third world life in a first world country.

Yang needs to keep this in mind if he wants the black vote!!

Terminator 12 : the revenge of Yang
#####
Andrew, why is it that you're willing to give even the 1% an extra thousand dollars, but not those on food stamps and TANF? And I find your solutions on public housing/gentrification unsatisfactory. Aside from all that, I think you're an amazing candidate... but as a person coming from extreme poverty, and having family still stuck in that trap, I feel that I can't support you until you change your stance on the freedom dividend a bit.
#####
The obvious argument against the war on drugs is that legalization would reduce criminality , crimes against property and interpersonal violence. The drug war warriors will argue that the criminals will then turn to other types of crimes . I guess you could see increased enrollments
in corporate accounting and computer cryptography classes so the scoundrels can really steal like world class Banksters...I mean gangsters .
See , the major problem with the drug war is : You never hear of a Sheriff or policeman going into corporate offices and demanding that they , the executives " empty their books " ; you never find Law Enforcement officers patrolling the hallways of Central Park South or Billionaires Row manhandling residents . 
In an aside . When ever I read about an incident of violence or mass violence , I immediately say to myself : Well , the suspect wasn't smoking pot , because that makes you peaceful ; and the suspect wasn't taking opiates , because they know that they will be experiencing withdrawal in jail .
One hundred and fifty years or so , the majority of Americans had complete certitude that ether African Americans should be slaves , or that there was no place in America for them . They were wrong .
Today , a majority of Americans still think that the ingesting some varieties of chemical enhancement are wrong . This is just as wrong as that other sentiment of one hundred and fifty years ago
#####
Andrew Yang would already poll in the top two , if in 2012 , Americans elect . org had been successful in establishing an Internet Presidential nomination . That would have also meant , If desired, the complete negation of party politics ; a circumvention of the primary's ;and an avenue for taking an argument  directly to the people .This had almost happened but the marquee Internet candidate at the time disavowed the process .
#####
I am a YANG BANGER now !  I will continue to policy wonk him to ensure No End Save Victory .

$1000 a month helps but it cannot replace 100% of the wage that was or would soon be lost.

An additional solution:

Since robots will take over our jobs leaving us with no salary, why not own those robots and have them earn the salary for us?

So, as President, Yang should work with banks to give loans to people who will purchase the robots that will work for them.

Example: truck drivers displaced by driverless trucks, can buy the robot truck that will earn money for them.

That way, people will earn a living wage and they may even be rich.

No hand outs.  No Socialism.

Honestly THIS IS LIKE A MOVIE YANG VS MACHINE
#####
Andrew, there's a TED talk I think you should watch. It's called "Why do so many incompetent men become leaders." 

I've seen it and to me this essential for anyone wanting to be an influential leader especially president. You'll likely need to be tactful to beat these other politicians, understand your opponents. 

Most of your potential voters aren't going to know you or understand you fully, look for ways to be influential to those people. I really want to see you succeed and I don't want you to fail because you were effectively not a competitive choice in the mind of the average American. You get how people think about primaries right? There's a lot of friction past the "choice between the lesser of two evils". That psychology is really important.

But you and your team are going great! Keep up the great work!
#####
Andrew Yang. The One
#####
the way to put the american people in charge is to establish democracy. when the activities of the public administration are driven by the electorate through  referendum and under the direct control of citizen initiative, you can at least be sure the welfare of the citizens is paramount. the necessity for open administration also ensures corruption and incompetence are hard to hide. mr. can not create his ideal society alone, presidents don't rule. not yet. congress will resist, supreme court will resist, and the chance of yang getting to the oval office is slim to begin with. remember, the previous choice of the democratic party was hillary clinton. their next choice is more likely to be beto o'borntorule.

I think sometimes I've thought "It's me against you" with politics. I've joined groups of people too as we promoted "You are the enemy" "You are the problem" 
Now I listen to Andrew Yang and I realise the U.S was built by US. I can forgive myself for left/right thinking and get onboard FORWARD.

This was beautiful. I look forward to more videos like this.
#####
Loving the logic based, economic theory that Andrew brings to the table. No typical dogmatic talking points, instead an innovative new schema of the world around us... You have my vote!
#####
There is a movie being made of Isaac Asimov's "Caves of Steel" which depicts a future in which Robots do all the mining and farmwork, but where there is great resistance to them being used in the cities. In fact in an early scene a riot erupts in a department store where a customer is being fitted for shoes by a Robot. Asimov's novels go on to depict the contrast with another society (on another planet) that has embraced Robots, and there are surprising consequences that go beyond putting people out of work.
The movie will be an interesting opportunity to depict and to explore the kinds of consequences to society that we may be seeing very soon.
#####
Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
#####
Although I support Andrew Yang in general, I think there's something he's overlooking. Robots on the factory floor may be OK, but I doubt that the public will welcome self-driving Uber taxis onto their city streets, and I think that hooded teenagers will take great joy in taking a baseball bat to any Fed Ex delivery bot that dares to go drive along a residential sidewalk.
#####
Spread the good word everyone!
#####
YANG GANG 2020 LETS KILL AMERICA
#####
see the power of 1000 dollars a month in the comments
#####
The videos on here are usually pretty cringy or boring. This one would work well as an ad. It's a bit slow, but doesn't waste my time. It's to the point and lets me know what I need to know about Yang.
#####
Mr. Yang, I believe you see what is happening no doubt but your estimate of the timing and what else will offset the changes as well as your main solution is not what I think will work best. But you are impressive and say or rather are preparing people to see some of the changes and concerns and I think you add greatly to the discourse. Most smart people should want to team up with you to brainstorm, debate and collaborate.
#####
Great vid, well done. YANG 2020!
#####
Yang will get all American back on their feet. Rid of poverty. Unite us.
#####
This is the man to UNITE all the tribes again.  YANG  MUST WIN. Humanity First!!!

He's going to be president.

A new president for a new era!

Mega corporations paying no taxes. Hmm
#####
We Yangin!
#####
URGENT: @2:35 the video say Henry.
#####
Mr . Yang , your Universal Basic Income proposal is putting the cart before the horse . First , you  need to end the war on drugs , and legalize some classes of these drugs used for recreation. Otherwise the UBI will fuel more steroid infused psychopaths in Law Enforcement uniforms chasing fat overtime pay checks in pursuit of their American Dream at the expense of everyone else . Are You Feeling Me ?

I supported Trump in 2016. After all the lies, it's time to switch to yang!

looking to the right... nigahiga podcast ft Andrew Yang
Genius marketing on youtube...
#####
If you got suckered by Trump and you know who you are. Switch to Democrat redeem your soul and vote for Yang
#####
Trump went from a TV show to the president!  Why don't you think Andrew Yang doesn't have a chance?  I believe he does with the situation we are faced with the Trump presidency! Not good with Trump!  Yang has a beneficial plan where Trump didn't and doesn't!
#####
I still play call of duty black ops two and I have to say people are more toxic in school then they are in the game
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Please LIKE this comment to make sure the message gets delivered :))

Your podcasts are a godsend, especially the ones with people like yang and and peterson, these are topics that people of all ages, especially people my age (23) need to be filled in on, they give me hope and direction for a better future and a better world.

They should put more taxes on fuel, housing, electronics, and on cars. Like if you buy a new car you have to pay an extra $5k on taxes for the car. People buy cars that are $10k over MSRP so what's another $5k. The government can add 50¬¢ to fuel prices. 10% on house/apartment rent and 10% on electronics.

hes really good at not pointing fingers, but i wonder who he values the least..

Hm, I wonder why they're more powerful than the government...
#####
I love ethan and yang is a chill dude but it‚Äôs mildly painful to hear ethan talk about politics like this, it‚Äôs just kinda obvious that he only has a very general understanding of the issues they‚Äôre talking about. still it‚Äôs nice that they‚Äôre making politics more accessible to they‚Äôre viewers by having a presidential candidate on, I doubt any other candidates would be laid back/ confident enough to come on a platform like this.
#####
Just found out you can get a channel blocker addon for your browser so I never have to see your stupid channel reccomended again, you lame sell out.
#####
Yaaaa I checked back into politics to be reminded of why I don't. I work way too hard to not catastrophize what's coming. What's the point of stressing over elite people making bougie decisions? I can't control the circumstance. Read an article, NPR on the way to work once in a while, then cast my vote. Less be real... If it's gonna happen it's been well on its way to happening for years now
#####
I know that this completely random and super  off topic  but anyone else think that there merchandise  especially Ethans sweater   is  shockingly  close , seriously  suspiciously  close to the try guys  pattern and  logo, it's so very  similar  that they even  have the  colored  square patches  pattern  designe with a  slight  variation in the  colors  they're using  on their  merchandise,  it's a strange  coincidence atleast to me  idk not  claiming that they  for sure  purposefully ripped off try guys  design only  that  I find it odd
#####
He makes economics look less complex then it has been

"Think of donating to me as an investment." That moment when politicians bribe their voters with their own money.

This election will be the first one I am old enough to vote in I honestly feel lucky Andrew Yang will be the first candidate I ever vote for, I hope everyone my age who finally gets to vote does so even if it‚Äôs not Yang but be real you like him too üòÇ
#####
Not even american and I want this guy as your president.
#####
This is a real dude running for President based on things that pissed him off. The others seem to be applying for a job. Yeah, they have their different methods but its a job to them. For Yang, it feels different.
#####
I usually hate listening to politics but it was a pleasure listening to this. Please invite this man back on to the show again. We need a President like Mr. Yang.
#####
Damn, (and I keep saying this in my comments here) I voted Trump & almost have tears in my eyes thinking about someone of this caliber having even a chance to become president, so insightful, so calm, so focused, I fuckin LOVE this guy! Libs, get this man on the fuckin ticket & he's already stolen this Trump vote
#####
I was TOTALLY on board with EVERYTHING he said until the "I'm all for a path to citizenship for people here undocumented" , I'm for A FEW immigrants, the number could be debated, but we've never even been asked what we want to do on this issue, you can't just allow a bunch of folks, that blew off our laws & just snuck in, to be rewarded with citizenship and therefore free fuckin money, & if we're promising them this, how many more would be incentivized to just sneak in, stay a few years, get amnesty & be rewarded with free money?
#####
Mentioning guns is a surefire way of NOT getting consevatives to vote for you. As a Brit I just can't understand why America doesn't do something about gun violence. Fuck some amendment written in a different time and just do something. You've had more mass shootings than days so far this year. You have little kids doing active shooter drills for fuck sake. Other countries had a mass shooting and acted straight away and they don't get mass shootings anymore. Even terrorists in Britain can't get hold of a gun and have to use a knife which means less deaths and easier to stop. I'm 37 and can only think of two mass shootings in my lifetime and one was a school shooting which changed gun laws forever in Britain. The other was a guy with a shotgun who I think was a farmer who had the gun legally.
#####
Yang: 100,000 people, $1,000 a month=12 million a month.......he IS a different typa chinamun

If you libs can get this guy on the ticket I'd change my vote

The moment UBI was lost was when MLK got killed. He was literally given his Holliday so people would stop talking about everything else he was trying to do. Everyone was so happy about his Holliday and the media made sure not to talk about anything else he did or was trying to do besides what he is only known for now.
#####
GD Ethan!! That was an absolutely AMAZING point about "even IF you invest your time you still don't feel like you can know what's going on", beautifully put
#####
I voted for Trump & am EXTREMELY conserative, much MUCH more so than Trump or probably even 90% of other conservatives & the ONLY other person (as of right now) I would vote for is Yang, largely due to the UBI.

Will this turn into the new Social Security too? 1,000.00 Retirements? 12,000 a year to retire on...

At the time the 2nd amendment was written, there was more than "single shot rifles", there were fully automatic rifles, and even gunships were legal for people to own. Jesus Christ the longer I listen the more brain cells I lose, you're a fucking idiot and so is yang.

H3H3, Cmon, guys. Im a long time viewer and sub since ~200k (podcast's sub) but this entire podcast is filled with inaccuracies and acts as an echochamber, in my opinion yang is the best democratic candidate despite some of his ludicrous ideas (the $1000 a month thing for all americans, for example.) For every american, to get $1000 a month for 12 months would cost the taxpayers 2.8 Trillion dollars, which by the way, taxing all fortune 500 companies extra would likely cause them to relocate to a different country to avoid paying the crazy taxes. Now hypothetically, lets say that the companies did continue on despite the VAT (value added tax) of 10%, that would only create 950 billion, which is a far cry from the 2.8 trillion needed for the UBI. from what taxfoundation dot org says, a more realistic scenario would be "reducing the UBI to $750 a month and a VAT of 22%"! This would cause every purchase you make cost extra, up to 22% extra to offset the VAT, mainly since companies dont take kindly to a decrease in profit margins.


Then comes the CARBON TAX. The worst idea Yang has presented yet, he proposes a tax of $40 per metric ton of carbon. Taxing carbon emissions will raise fuel prices (which i should add, does not only power vehicles, but large capacity generators, any cargo ship/passenger ship and many more). and also increase the price of almost everything you buy, since the things you buy need to be shipped there (unless made in house), which takes fuel to move the product. Forbes predicts up to a 10% increase in the prices of basic needs such as; Electricity, food, clothing, water and shelter.

Flat Taxes would protect poorer Americans. The tax code is larger than the Bible, this means corporations and rich Americans can use complicated backdoors to get out of paying taxes. We need a one-page tax code that is transparent. We need to let the rich keep their money but stop them from shipping their money to off-shore accounts, we need to crack down on venture capitalists like Paul Singer who buy off Republican politicians, and we need incentive systems that push for more marriage and families. This is coming from a Republican and Trump voter.

...yang kinda cute
#####
I've had nightmares in these self driving vehicles

Andrew Yang is going to be the most memed figure of 2020.

How is the problem not China? They steal intellectual property at the rate of billions a year.

Take authentic individual purpose out of our lives, trade it in for traditional forced indoctrination and this is the world you get.

Why would u not want him to be ur president
#####
But won't the government go after your income tax no matter where you are as long as you're an American? My friend was born here but never lived here and 30 years later he had a notice from the US government....
#####
Picture this. Bernie and Yang together. The old and the new joining forces. That's what I want to have in my life.
#####
This is the first time I've really seen anything from Yang and I've gotta say he's the first political candidate I could listen to talk politics for hours. Officially a member of the Yang Gang.
#####
üå¥üå¥
#####
lolhe got my vote but i dont like his laugh
#####
I want to like yang, but immigration concerns me. If he pulls a leftie and decides to import poor people and pay them to vote for him, Americans are going to keep losing their voice. 




I do appreciate his lack of pandering though. Major problems with the democratic party are blatantly buying and importing voters. The democratic party is due for a split, because non republicans are forced to vote for garbage like Elizabeth Warren due to the democratic party's rigged primary system. Something like a people's party and a non-people's party lmao. Too bad most voters arent smart enough to stop supporting the trash front runners. I'm sick of trump as much as you, but I'd sooner slit my wrists than show support for Bernie Warren Clinton or Biden.
#####
Yang is a fucking beast and I love him.
#####
Andrew kinda cusses a lot.
#####
Getting some seriously creepy vibes from this guy...
#####
not american, just here to like the videos and comment so this guy gets more attention
#####
Cannot wait to hear him on the podcast again this month. Love listening to him speak üëè

If you believe that then you believe in fairy tales. Can not believe people would not vote for a woman veteran. People are so naive, they would vote for people that would promise you free handouts, instead of a woman who has spent her life to keep your sorry asses free and safe. So much for "Thanks for you service"

Okay do buy everything off of Amazon before the prices skyrocket

Usa and yang gang leave me alone... Con-sult artificial intelligence sexual coercion is a big NO NO on a man with a seal w/ the highest degree of conciousness do not compare yourself on him. I bet they gonna forgive you let me put this way same old story no providence from CHIEFTAIN ALMOST FORGOTTEN.
#####
Yang seems to look at the real root of issues.
#####
I've always said we need a coastal elite to run this country.  Here he is.
#####
I swear this man needs to be leading this country! If the dnc gives the nomination to to old farts like warren or bernie, I'm done with them
#####
Yang is like Obama and Clinton mix awesome

YANG FOR PRESIDENT! EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED! üá∫üá∏

I find it refreshing that a candidate presents solutions, while media and politicians are just smearing each other like children
#####
Coming from Serbia I generally have a huge amount of scepticism towards American politicians. This guy tho clearly speaks feom his hearth and mind, my full support.
#####
Andrew yang really solves the problem. Life is getting harder everyday for the average American. AI and technology only benefits a subset of the people. Yet these tech companies are using loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Amazon and the likes are killing all the retailers and people are losing jobs. But they are pocketing and making some people hecka rich. But these rich people know how to play tax games and not paying fair share. We really need to implement what Andrew yang propose on universal basic income. And that money need to come from luxury VAT. Otherwise we will face societal problems getting worse. More Homeless people on the streets, more car thefts etc. these problems will exacerbate because people can no longer afford to make rents, have a job. Think about it people. Please I beg you. Even if we are not ready for an asian president, we really need to solve the problems with his proposed solutions. That‚Äôs the only way to go
#####

His Concept of paying citizens a monthly income was proposed in Morocco by non other than a Mathematician and the Moroccan Mathematician name is BEN BARKA who was assassinated by the Moroccan Government in France.

Amazon put me out of work. I am an author who was paid for writing books. The books took years to write. They helped people. Now our intellectual property is given away "used" at Amazon. The population benefits more easily, from free information and culture, but we the creative artists cannot survive. We have been hit by the "get it free" Internet, intellectual property thieves around the world and maga stores including Amazon.
#####
Here in the Philippines, people with good intentions and the most qualified to run for presidency almost never wins. and if ever he/she won, he/she will get back-to-back-to-back backslash from medias, protest from different groups, from citizens who hadn't supported from the start and even those elected politicians from other parties.
#####
how could you not vote for a guy who wants to pay you $1000 a month and offer you health care?
 VOTE YANG 2020.
#####
Shoot now I have a debate on my own.... Yang vs Warren? ü§îüßê

He is 500% correct on Amazon for closing 30% of the stores across America. Why? Bcuz ever since I discovered Amazon 10 yrs ago I have not stepped out of my doors to go n shop like I use to do yrs before Amazon.

Yeah, I am sooo ready for a fun and productive, efficient system with the bonus of Asian/American jokes

An AI greeting is creepy? LOL
You know what is creepy? forcing people to talk for hours in a call center and all other mindless grind jobs.
The robots contribute to society, why do you want to force people, that don't want it? An unmotivated worker is a problem.
In most jobs you have 2 or 3 people doing 90% of the work, the rest can be replaced by a toaster.
People get minimum base income, to not be worried and get into depression and crime. Is this not worth to pay for?
Our taxes go into the pockets of people who want a second house and fifth car.
The motivation for people to work is to have more. Bye, some stuff and spend money traveling or enjoying life.
Now we have the situation, that people with jobs have not the time to spend their money. People without jobs have no money to spend.
Businesses can be made more predictable. Fire and Hire people will be easier for both sides. 
Small enterprises have better chances to survive not paying money for unused work power.
When robots work for you, why do you need a job? 
Are you born to work? Is your worth defined by your work? Do you die immediately without enough work?
Are you a half men, if you work 4 hours 4 days a week?
Somebody brainwashed people to think like this. 
Animal work to survive. Humanity managed it several thousand years ago, but somehow we work more for less.
We have machines and are afraid of working less than 12 hours for a paycheck, that doesn't allow you to sleep well...
#####
I boycotted the debate & am just catching some clips & interviews about it. Looks like the other candidates are stealing his platform with vague commentary, not #data. Yes, it will be better than Trump's "vision", but Andrew Yang knows his shit. Another candidate will be a luke-warm substitute for Andrew & his thought out & detailed policies. He has stated all along that he will help in any capacity that he can, even if he is not elected. If Andrew Yang doesn't become president it will be a travesty.
#####
Trevor - When are you going to have Andrew back on?
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 


In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

If I got that dividend, I would save. I'm a single mother of two, no child support, and I literally have almost to none in savings because I just can't save. I live paycheck to paycheck and even if I didn't have to save for my children, either for a safety net or college, I would save up for a vacation. I never thought I would ever get to go on vacation or get even close to a family vacation, but I want to do that. I want to share experiences with my children and give them memories. I wouldn't stop working, but I would enjoy life more if I wasn't constantly worried financially.


Currently, I'm a full-time student working two part-times as well as a single mother. I'm trying my best to open more doors so I can give my kids a more promising future. YANG 2020 for President.

#####
Gee making the rounds on the MSM circuit.  If that ain't a dead giveaway.  He is priming the pump for 2024.  Getting all those non committals into the DEM lair.  Slow indoctrination , getting people used to hearing free money every month, the rich are going to give it to you, you will have freedom to pursue your dream vocation.  Dang Yang is going to support you.  You dreamers you.  Come to my side, I'm so smart, I like math, I gonna get Amazon to pay for it all,  you just dream about your dream job that AI has stolen from you, you dream on and on cause Dang Yang gonna support you, no worry little grasshopper, I take good care for you.

If you are American, but did not vote for Andrew Yang, you either an idiot or in the same league with Jeff Bezos...
#####
Oh my God, I am not an American but I really LOVE him! 1000000% would vote for him. You could see his goodwill to change not just America, but the world view of the future economy.
#####
Yang needs to team up with celebrities to get more views
#####
Even President Tweeter is addicted to Ai.
#####
They usually introduce him as "an entrepreneur." They forget to mention that he's actually a CEO for Venture for America, a lawyer with a Doctorate in Juris (Jurisprudence = philosophy of law), his dad has a Ph.D. in physics, his mom has a Master in Statistics (both from UC Berkeley), and his brother is a professor at NYU... Dang! sounds like he came from a smart family. No wonder why his opponents do not attack him like others because he gives them facts and evidence with his reasonings. I like him  :)
#####
Bold ideas. No. He has the same ideas that capitalist have been using to lobby Washington all this time. Vilify poor ppl but first deceive them into buying our conservative bullshit and voting against their own economic interests.  Yang is a progressive imposter.  His Orwellian approach is brilliant but poor people will suffer under a yang administration.
#####
Andrew Yang seems like a nice guy. That disqualifies him to be President. His ideas of welfare payments of $1000 a month will never work. We have people living off the government now with welfare and food stamps of more than a thousand a month. Trump 2020
#####
Donated.  He's smart, one on one with Doncon and he will turn in to Donbabycon.
#####
80% of Trevor's show wont exist if Trump wasnt a President of USA because most of the time trevor's talking content surrounds around Trump. Its ironic how Trevor keeps his stomach full due to someone's existence.
#####
The only person to benefit from this presidency will be him.
#####
At first I kinda felt weird taking money from a business. But then he worded it as a trillion dollar business that pays no taxes and then it's like "Oh! Well sign me up."
#####
He will be president.
#####
No more Trump of course on next election but really? Yang? He's good but we need his background crosschecked, his ID tell he's american, what about his heart? What about his soul? Are they 'american'?
#####
If Andrew Yang wasn't Democrat, I would be voting for him.
One thing I don't believe is that, NORMAL people should not be given free money, work for it!
#####
I want $1000 in every month üò™
#####
the asian guy can be trusted, we are the middle men jk
#####
Since I'm not an American, there can be loads of thing i don't know about American politics but I really think Andrew Yang can make a difference. He comes from an entrepreneurial standpoint and mindset that allows him to be respectfully sit down, listen and talk even with those who oppose him. I guess the election is not just about who has the best policy but who has the ability to deliver it. And with that progressive approach, I really hope Andrew Yang can be the one to make that change

The first nominee who doesn‚Äôt want to fool us but enlighten us and think harder . I‚Äôm conservative and logical and I‚Äôm on board with him. 

To further enlighten, America has performed giving out funds previously to all citizens, back in 2008/2009 with a ‚ÄúStimulus Check‚Äù it was just about $1000. The issues that occurred, Americans are obsessed with things ‚ÄúUn-American‚Äù and purchased merchandise that was foreign produced so they found it didn‚Äôt 100% boost the American economy when you‚Äôre purchasing Sony cameras or putting a down payment on a Toyota vs a Ford.

Local businesses did benefit but overall the American economy didn‚Äôt.
#####
American's democracy should be termed dictatorship of corperations. This man will never make his way to the president as his policy concerns most on working class. He is what America needs at the moment or what the world needs at the moment. But sadly, the system in the U.S. only will choose the one who fit in the system, and he doesnt fit in. People like this kind will make his way in China though.

Andrew Yang has a great vision to help others. But so did Jacques Fresco 
( https://youtu.be/PIMy0QBSQWo ), Buckminster Fuller ( https://youtu.be/V8U1kehhVd4 ) , and many others who several decades before Andrew Yang proposed ways and alternatives to take care of all humanity while intelligently managing our earth's finite resources. I encourage all to not only vote for UBI but also look up these other great thinkers and consider their ideas of changing our society in unprecedented ways.

Don't judge a book by its cover, vote for Andrew Yang for President for his ideas.

#####
The cards that will be dealt to this guy, is immigrants, racial, and insecurities in people that don't follow the whole story. 

He is not ending all problems in the coming future, he is paving a step(s) of a "path" that can actually allow the citizens to benefit from advancement in technology, and those advancements are coming whether you oppose or not, and he is just allowing its people to not be sidelined and go with 0 income and balance out at negative dollars. Which already happened, is happening, and will be harsher than ever. 

He knows well that he will not be in the seat long enough to do a full on expedite of 25++ years worth of catch up, but at least he is doing it, because other politicians he previously tried to appeal to, did not see his proposals as winning

The reason so many Silicon Valley millionaires are behind UBI is very simple. As robotics increasingly replace workers in Amazon warehouses or fast food restaurants and as self driving technology will replace the millions of uber and Lyft drivers all these workers will need to be laid off. So according to today‚Äôs rules amazon and the other companies would have to bear a burden of these unemployment benefits. However if the UBI is offered then no unemployment benefits would need to be paid. So the burden gets shifted from these companies that laid off these workers to the tax payers. Get it.

Ok guys, time to step it up. We need more people that are politically disengaged to learn about Yang. We have the power to do this.

It is not MATH (Make America Think Hard) but it is MATHAJ (Make America Think Hard About Jesus) None of these Democratic Presidential candidates ever talks about Jesus in their speech from the podium. Do they feel shame talking about Jesus? Do they want to take Jesus out of the picture? America is a christian country and we christians will not be fooled by these Democratic candidates gablygoobly speech. All the christian pastors of united states church MUST tell their congrigations to vote for our Christ loving Christian President Donald J.Trump and re-elect him for the second term. Amen.

Refreshing but can he make it through to the end of the finals?  Watch and see!  If he can make it through I will be watching to see.  Still interesting  hmmm!
#####
You need a longer stick if you're that short. Yang has to stay bowed & crouched to fit in your angle üôÉ
#####
Can‚Äôt believe NBC actually recognized Andrew Yang
#####
Dont rely on NBC or MSNBC for giving Yang fair air time. they have blatantly shown to be biased against him by omitting him from some of their coverage.  All these  main stream media outlets are corrupt and manipulative
#####
Either yang is tall or the lady is short
#####
#YANGMENTUM
#####
Andrew Yang is a great human being. Anyone who will take the time to learn about him and watch his interviews and find out what he wants to do if he becomes president will give Andrew Yang there vote.
#####
Andrew Yang rocks. Really the only candidate worth supporting. He is young, smart, has great plans for the US. And he puts a smile on your face, he is actually a nice guy. (A politician who is also a nice guy? Is that even possible. Yup Yang is our man.) #YangGang
#####
She's cute AF!
#####
NBC screwed over Yang yet again in another graphics snub, hate to say it but maybe FOX really is more fair and balanced in other things
#####
Glad to see that they did a piece with Yang here.  It's such a critical time for our countryand we need the BEST ideas out where where they can be shared.  Now, I just hope NBS and MSNBC can fix their run of omitting Yang off the scoreboard when he's performed better than other candidates.
#####
NBC News is fake news. Include Andrew Yang in your reporting and enough with the fake news! You are one of the the reasons why our country is so divided.
#####
Stop the media blackout on Andrew Yang!
#####
Yang is such a cool guy
#####
Yang2020!!
#####
Dangerous NWO liar.   He is anti energy and will destroy our nation.  He is part of the climate change LIE!
#####
Watch this guy will be a president.
#####
Andrew is a good man.
#####
Is Andrew really tall or is she just really short?  I can feel her neck pains
#####
The real question is: How short is that lady?
#####
such an authentic laugh, his heart is golden.
#####
I know we all like and love Andrew Yang, but don't just show it online, make sure to go and vote in the primary so he can be the nominee. We have to help Andrew. He cannot  get to the WH w/o the #YangGang.
#####
I see Andrew Yang , I click & I like. SIMPLE.

I feel like I've seen him somewhere before???

Hot woman

the country is determined to create change? huh. So this is you determined?
Face it. There is nothing out of the ordinary about humans wacking each other. We aren't a great species, if you like not getting wacked.
#####
Andrew is empathising with this woman‚Äôs ordeal. He has visible tears throughout the shot. This #betamale shit I‚Äôm seeing throughout the comments is inherently #betamale. Try take the route that requires thinking rather than cynicism

#####
Fuck cnn y‚Äôall bitches took Andrew‚Äôs videos down...disgusting
#####
A leader should not cry in such situation. It's a sign of weakness. And anyway it looks fake.
#####
YANG is an actual human compared to the other candidates. His tears are a sign of empathy and compassion, not weakness. Unfortunately, a majority of my fellow Americans prefer to have a lying rapist clown as president.
#####
He‚Äôll either be a legend or a cautionary tale, but he‚Äôs going to be something.
#####
Yang for 2020
#####
Andrew yang was also worrying about his son possible to face killed by gun force. That's reason why Andrew yang cried.
#####
YANG is an idiot.
#####
I‚Äôm a Johnny-Come-Lately to this post, but good on Andrew Yang for doing what all of us who care about the almost-uniquely-American scourge of gun violence find ourselves doing much, much too often.  Every time I think I have no more tears to shed, my senses are assaulted and my heart breaks again and again and again when we are nearly daily reminded that for too many in power today, gun rights reign perversely preeminent above the right to live.  Haven‚Äôt we done things the NRA‚Äôs way long enough?  Haven‚Äôt enough innocent children been executed yet?  Haven‚Äôt we worshipped at the altar of Second Amendment Supremacy To All Else long enough?  I‚Äôm probably going to vote for _whomever_ the Dems nominate because with a gun-loving demented racist sociopath & his pusillanimous sycophants running things, I‚Äôd vote for a termite-riddled tree stump before I vote for anyone with an ‚ÄúR‚Äù after their name.  Though I‚Äôm not committed to any candidate yet, Andrew Yang never ceases to impress me.  The man is not only intelligent and thoughtful and dedicated, the man‚Äôs got such heart...and in this clip, you couldn‚Äôt miss how broken it is over all this senseless violence.  I know how he feels.  I don‚Äôt know what will become of Andrew Yang, but I am beyond-thankful that he cares enough about all of us to sacrifice so much to simply _DO THE RIGHT THING!_ I can‚Äôt help but adore the man and his passion. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

All you leftists should watch this. Ex soviet kgb agent Yuri Bezmenov predicted all your thoughts and actions 30 years ago. Because it was literally his job to create people like you for the sole purpose of destabilizing nations to make them vulnerable to communist revolution. None of your thoughts are original, they're prepackaged from almost a century before you were born. You're useful idiots the type of government You're hellbent on electing. You're not on the right side of this fight. No matter how egalitarian you think you are.

Is CNN being rasict? They made an article about the Fresno mass shooting in the hmong community. Their headlines carries a celebratory tone, making it seem like a good event. And now they doing Andrew dirty? Whats up? I dont wanna assume CNN is rasict but they even havent issued or made an apology to us hmong ppl nor gave us audience  any reason why they did andrew dirty.

America has a gun problem. In fact the problem is with Americans themselves who think killing is the answer to everything. Take a good long look at your politicians who start wars all over the world and kill millions of people and ask what example that sets for the American people and then look at what's happening at home. All that killing is coming home to roost.
#####
What a crock of shit!!!

Yang lost my vote sorry I was gonna jump ship but trump 2020 very disappointed

Give that man a tissue because he isn't getting an Oscar.

Wtf. China is biggest enemy of USA. You fuking stupid ass Americans seat here and discuss about Chinese guy to be commander and chief. How stupid is that?  I don‚Äôt care how smart this Yang is he is Chinese drop out. USA at war with China no fuking Chinese are in high level of government officer. Fuking fake news CNN aka China News Network

Andrew Yang is not left or right. He is forward. Trump is scared of him, he even admitted to it.

CNN disappointed me by taking down those videos of my man.  I think CNN no longer reflect people's view not only conservative but also democrats.  SO CNN, WHO's view you reflect, big cooperation?

Omg what can I do to get the peoples vote??
I know!!! Starts crying

@CNN, Yang is much more than a humane and caring human being. Give him the full coverage that he deserves and stop with the media bias.  You will lose a lot more followers.

Dude breaks down and cry
CNN reporter: The human candidates appear to expressing emotions during a talk about gun violence.
CNN caster: Excellent Analysis, I'm sure other humans have a similar emotion when talking about gun violence.


What the fuck are you okay CNN? Did you suck the soul out of them or did you get them like that?
#####
CNN, where are the other Yang‚Äôs greatest videos on his policies like those you have on other candidates???????

Damn, I respected him before but this is the worst fake crying I‚Äôve ever seen. He‚Äôs imagining a situation in his head and then ‚Äúcries‚Äù so much that he cant speak. Definitely not president material!

I bailed out Wall St., the auto industry and banks that were too big to fail in The Crash of 2008, losing everything in the fray -- my career, my health insurance, and my considerable retirement investments.  GM is alive and well today because of MY generosity, and still paid no taxes on $4.3 Billion in domestic profits last year.  So it's okay to subsidize Big Business, but it's not alright to add a little to my below-poverty level income, right?  What's wrong with this picture?  I deserve better.  Yang 2020.

They did something similar like this in China to my family, then it took a hard turn into communism. :/

We already "give" millions of dollars to States, Counties, Cities and Towns. They are expected to distribute those funds to individuals via services, like police, fire, etc. Instead, much of that money is wasted or improperly spent. UBI will take that money and instead, give it to individuals directly to spend on a local tax for another fire truck, or buy local produce or support a local handy man service for some upgrades. Or combine the money with family, friends or neighbors to purchase a fixer up rental house. Anyway - no money wasted. NOT LEFT. NOT RIGHT. Forward... #YangGang
#####
$1000 for every Americans is duable, if American stop giving billions in other countries, because Americans is over tax, but the goverment is giving it away to other countries, also stop making expensive weapons, but instead just sell sell Americans product to the whole world, People around the world likes made in USA
#####
Notice that all the economists that are against UBI are ancient!
#####
6:09 Sounds idealistic...but the reality is, we are not doing that. Corporations are shedding jobs faster than they create them. And there is no government/societal effort to try to ensure everyone has a job. Profits first is the good ol' American way. But with automation rapidly evolving, if we don't evolve our economy to handle the sudden displacement, we are shooting ourselves in the foot....hobbling America so that the Jeff Bezoses of the world can swim in more cash than they could possibly ever need!

Come on CNBC you are framing this completely wrong... Your title should actually be "Elon Musk And Andrew Yang Support UBI - Are the Global Elite ready to give back our fair share?"

As Yang said, we are the stockholders of the biggest economy in the history of the world!    Where are my thounsend bucks a month?
#####
#YANG2020 my ppl
#####
Even if all the people do if UBI is implemented is spend it... its still going into the economy.. and even if VAT tax is implemented to those major tech businesses... UBI would give the people money to spend on those major tech businesses.. thus going back to the economy..
#####
Let's start another experiment. Give me $1000 a month for five years and I'll report back  yearly. There has to be longitudinal parameters for a true measurement of the program.
#####
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are both pro-UBI, but for some reason CNBC cares more about some economists nobody's ever heard of.

time to dislike on all my alts

human beings and loving free thingsüòÜüòÜ. America deserves a president who isnt just going to around giving people handouts because everyone knows that's not sustainable... but instead we the people need a president who is going to build a country that works everyone. Whether rich or poor, young or old. It will take more just a shallow UBI idea to do that. To just come out and say that everyone should earn 1000usd out of nowhere will distort the economic equilibrium and will in the long run lead to the collapse of the American and probably the global economy as we know it!!

It‚Äôs not money for nothing. It‚Äôs money for all the data these corporations harvest from us.

#####
Who bail out thaw banks ?!?!?!? They have the money but when it come to the people the give you the shaft in the hole
#####
UBI is a double edge sword, but it still has more good then bad to it, i feel like some Rules might need to be implemented just so money isn't used wrongly (and yes i know it could still be used in a bad way even if you buy normal things, i just want to make it harder for anyone to use the money in a wrong way), i know people in my area that might stop stealing things from people but would use that 1k a month on drugs but i also know a lot of single mothers and fathers that would use that 1k for their children and their Cars, not to mention bills and household supply's. Also 1k a month would make a small amount of people not want to work anymore but a large number would continue to work for more more, 1k a month for me is enough for bills but i still want more money to buy things id like to have for my hobbies.
#####
How about if you make over 60k a year you dont qualify for UBI ???

"The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other [...] Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available..."

#####
You haters can hate, but like Mr Musk said , it will still come anyway , whether we do it early to gain experience or do it late when the country's economy is fked and the crime rate climbs up
#####
To give everyone 1000 a month would cost just over half of the us military budget, I think it‚Äôs reasonable.
#####
Why couldn't this $1k freedom dividend¬†be funded through a personal Information tax on giant internet corps like Amazon and Facebook collecting all of our personal¬†data. Obviously this data increases marketability and subsequently revenue as well. A tax figure could come from the estimated difference between sales with/without data.¬†This would inadvertently allow citizens to receive an income in exchange for their personal data. Far fetched?

Bear in mind it's not "Americans" calling it "free money." It's CNBC, which happens to be one of the huge, bloated corporations (that barely pays any taxes) Yang is talking about.
#####
I mean seriously this automation might actually be the end of USA.
The reason well think about it,  with tons of unemployed people crime rate will surely increase thus destroying the country from the inside. 
And the victims the mid-class and less privileged  which will lead to the less-privileged committing crimes (drug dealing, stealing,etc) to support their families.
And guess the rich will have very high security  causing the less-privileged to pray on the Mid-class  citizens
BTW I am not American so why do i care ? Cause we are all human . Any way Good luck america may the president who cares most about all the people succeed *PEACE OUT*
#####
Just think of UBI as an Amazon rebate, who doesn't love rebates??

You all out to get Yang ! Just like you guys posted a different picture for the debate !

UBI sucks. 10,000 a year!

hold up hold up.you are telling me, there is NO VAT IN USA??fucccccc

I would pay my rent and bills with it every month and use my hard earned check for my family to live comfortably without stress and worry of disconnected utilities.

The only reason Ive been able to further my career was from the luxury of living with savings from my family. Many people do not have this luxury and they suffer greatly for it when their potential is just as great as everyone elses! I had time to further my skills while my friends had to push through 12 hour shifts at a job leaving them no time to live their life. Give people the cushion to focus on themselves and they will achieve amazing things!
#####
This is smart because we have a problem with illegal immigration, but if we make all American citizens get $1000 a month. Immigrants that are not yet citizens will be encouraged to get there greencard.
#####
if the issue is technology is being used replace jobs How would the answer be to pay people 1000 a month how would the answer not be to restrict what we use technology for. Technology should be used to make our lives better not live for us

It did not fail in Canada. It worked really well in Manitoba. And as the pilot project was suppose to take off in Ontario. The newly elected Conservative Government (Doug Ford) just suddenly killed it even though the results on its affordability and effects weren't even in. Just want to clarify on that.
#####
I don't know about you but I'll put that 1K to good use. By the way, that UBI as Yang has said, will come from big tech companies who has grown because of us "the people" that either spend on their products or just use their products and give them data so that they can keep growing financially.
#####
It‚Äôs our money anyway. We know best how to manage it. I‚Äôd much rather have a trickle up policy than a trickle down one.
#####
You got it wrong. LOL It's not for doing nothing. It's for allowing tech companies to use your data. Andrew Yang calls it the Freedom Dividend. It's a return on investment. Do your MATH.
#####
I will tell you what Universal Basic Income will do that no one is even talking about. 
It will decrease many criminal categories by at least 50% and in some categories almost eliminate the criminal activities. But rich people don't really care, cos they are living in parallel societies where their kids go to private schools etc., so they are not really being affected by criminal environment.
And living in a criminal environment forces people to develop personalities that the academics label as "Sociopaths, Narcissists, Borderlines etc" because you need to be crazy to survive a crazy environment.

$1,000 a year or month?
#####
I'd be able to afford to go to the dentist for the first time in 15 years ;/
#####
All rich people are against this. I think this is one of the most amazing things that could be done for American people. Lazy people will always be lazy. But other people will use that income security to better themselves and their life‚Äôs. If I had 1000 a month to pay for my baby‚Äôs daycare or a part of rent, I will be running to get a better education, to be better at my job. Cuz I have that security, that I can afford care for my baby while I study and work. Or that I can cover a part of my rent, which is crucial.

Good to have this presented clearly.

Hm is this what I think it is. A type of new society where people works replace by machines and money get separated from how it supposed to be. I have been thinking about this for a long time for why we are still living in a dark age where people keep abuse money from other people works. There is no way to close the gap between the rich and the poor as well as human aren‚Äôt the labor to one to another. You basically ask to work but not understanding how to work while there is no money for you to invest, especially technology, business, and education. The problem that this UBI must be separated in money using for human physical needs, intellectual activities, and survival. Dealing with insurance is an alternative route since this only for large investment or safety protection (basically this is a business model, not community access). You don‚Äôt do that because you know how greedy we are as a person even the banking system themselves. Money should be divided into 2 groups: cash and credits. Cash only for paying physical materials and credits for services in needs, including entertainment, education, daily basic supplies such as foods, water, shelter(rental), and other survival conditional supports.
As for those who want to take advantage of this system to make their own money into the pocket. It isn‚Äôt going to be easy if the money is just a visual digital value (like Bitcoin as a new type of currency). The credit system is based on how much contribution for that person into society economy. In order for people to get the money, they have to prove that they are working and continue to contribute to the society with a record of success and failure by agreement trademark (signature approval). This is where we need a contract, recommendation, or review from a certified resources (those with qualified credits and have permit license via Social Security). Credits build up by works (things that help others or improve life quality), and the more contribution add to the basic income, the more money you will get back each month on saving account. There only two types of payment system needed: a net income account and saving account. Net income is the basic money for daily spend and receive throughout individual works that directly get from salary payments and transfer money. Saving account only receive the UBI and manual deposit money for fitness plans (only welfare or benefits is allowed to deposit for no tax or fees). The differences that saving money will not get charge by tax while net income does.

Another type of money that needed to have but this is restricted to a group project or community use. The Commercial Business Budget (CBB) is only using for companies and a group of people who want to invest in scaled projects that individual can‚Äôt do alone with their own money. This is where market holders, tax, stocks, and credits get shared by everyone who sign up for them. Base on how much net worth the company get and the percent that a person invest into this project. Depend on the agreement, each person get to retrieve a certain amount out to their account for business and other uses (taxing probably higher than personal use so the only way is taking out the money and transfer to personal account if someone really want to use outside of the business use). Because this is public to anyone so if someone overuse the money, others will get notice right away (to avoid moral aspects, cooperations need to secure the money with a safety system beside PIN or SSN to the funds). The rest work like usual business model.

Tax should be different between personal use and business use. The saving account is free tax and no money transfer in except UBI and other free tax income. Instead of creating a bunch of welfare that people don‚Äôt even use, let choose whatever they want to be with their own money and take responsibility for their actions. If someone afraid about something we can‚Äôt pay back in time. There are insurances and extra services for borrowing or lending money. Paying fees for banking and extra charge for resources can be removed from how things just did with the financial crisis. Bank should focus on dealing with commercial properties not personal properties. It‚Äôs same for educational institutions and non profit groups. For the question where the money come from, look at the stock market over cryptographic blockchains for how to get the money. Supply and demand, trading throughout global market economy. The plot hole would begin back to where people think that we owned a land and all materials around us as our properties. You don‚Äôt physically create them, we steal them and make money (rather saying ‚Äúborrowing without a refund‚Äù is a more correct term). So, it doesn‚Äôt matter how worthy something is but further the needs for providing an access to productive activities are more on concerns.

Technically, technology change how things work and it is more about conveniences than stuff like healthcare, insurance, and put high taxes on everything that neither rich or poor get the money they deserve to have while working the heck of what they are doing in general without the society noticed, especially community services, or non profits organizations.

He wants to get this money from Amazon and Google. 
Amazon and google will simply stop selling your information. No one works to give it away. If you read the small print on amazon and google u will see that you forfeited your information by using there services. This guy can't just knocked on a companies door and say I'm taking your money and giving it away. These companies now own that information.  You can't simply take what isn't yours. Can you imagine what this would cause lol. And doesnt welfare give under 1000.00? Then ya all welfare recipients will go for that 1000.00. This certainly sounds like a sales pitch to get in office. Be wary
#####
I don‚Äôt believe in UBI, I think rather than give money to people directly just spend it directly on healthcare, teaching, infrastructure, housing, frontline public services etc.

People need to wake up!!
how can the average joe be against this??

Hello YangGang!

I'm all for UBI if it doesn't impact general inflation of common goods (food etc) which would generally be an issue since America lives in a capitalist society.  It's a slippery slope that would have side effects that would need to be addressed before moving forward.


If figured out properly, I'm all for it...  Those small test generally mean nothing though..

6:40 he talks about "smart" guns, which in theory, sounds awesome, keep in mind, I am a gun owner, but that technology has been cracked a couple years ago, someone at a hacker convention basically bypassed that system with almost no effort. That knowledge is out there and a person stealing or buying a gun illegally could easily find someone to bypass it. I like the idea, but in this current day and age, it isn't really viable.

It would definitely reduce the firearms use, therefore there would be fewer people being shot or killed....

A breath of fresh air.. contemporary, relevant, technology benefit based, humane reasoning that is also practical.¬† The biggest strangle hold on America is the current RebubliKan led Senate. They blocked Obama's programs, judge appointments, many policies just because they were Democratic... Obama's.. .and they - McConnell - CAN. Two point solution - Replace McConnell, Nunes, Graham, et. al.¬† and elect a man, a Democratic staff of Yang!
#####
So. Fake.
#####
First off we already have Universal background checks. Second I can get behind the personalization of guns. but there has to be a way for the gun owner to be able to allow their child, family member and or friend to use the gun. if they choose to do so. So when they go to teach their children about firearm safety as well as how to use firearms they can do so. So there has to be a way for the gun owner to be able to do that and allow the child to be able to use the gun while under their supervision. but not be able to use it when not under the parents supervision. because as a parent and a gun owner I want to be able to teach my child gun safety and proper gun etiquette. like  in which situations is it okay to use that gun.  those 4 situations being one target practice 2  Firearms sporting events  3 hunting and 4 personal and Home Defense when your life is in imminent danger. so as long as there is a way for that gun owner to pick and choose who can use the firearm while under their supervision. but not use the firearm while not under their supervision then I can get behind the gun personalization. I can see the potential for that as being a way to prevent criminals from being able to use stolen firearms. as well as a way  to prevent some forms of accidental shootings, because you're not going to be able to completely stop all of them. lastly you can't buy back something that you never owned in the first place. so you need to change your terminology on that one  and if you just so happen to buy an antique or potentially historical firearm then those need to be placed in museums not destroyed. because with such a program there is a possibility that you will purchase a firearm that there is only one of or a limited number of left in existence and such Firearms need to be preserved as historical artifacts not sent to the smelter. if you can guarantee to me that these things will happen then I'd be willing to support the personalization and the buy off programs.                    P.S.    you're not taking my AR or AK they have not fired a single shot in anger so therefore you do not have the right to do so.

Still dumb how Democrats use the term assault weapon. Fully automatics have been banned for 50 years, and semi automatic rifles like the AR-15 are not the main weapons used in mass shootings. Love yang, but hate nonsensical terms. And during the assault weapons ban of 1994-1998 the most infamous school shotting happened, Columbine.

This is the reason I won‚Äôt vote for him. He has a lot of good points but this is an outright infringement on our rights.

Thanks for pointing out the source of the problem, most people are unhappy in small and big areas. Economic instability has driven people to the edge, that‚Äôs one step forward instead of just taking the good people‚Äôs right to protect themselves. That is the only reason to even own a firearm. It‚Äôs a privilege and a right at the same time. Problem solving is the way, not stirring up the wrong pot.
#####
Finally a candidate that focuses on the majority of the U.S. not the poor or the rich but instead the shunned middle class
#####
Everyone ought to own a gun. Everyone ought to be able to protect themselves. Not just from robbers or murderers but from anyone who encroaches upon them. Whether it be the government, business, shooters, or anyone else.

some of his policies are too far left, and the democrats dont have any good candidates. Ill be voting for Trump

Fake crybaby.
You will lose if you EVEN try to take away our constitutional right buddy!

Yeah yang sorry but you're uneducated on guns, how they function and the actual statistics of gun violence over the past 50 years. 

Every year alcohol causes more kids 17 years old and under to be killed by drunk drivers in America than mass shootings have killed in the past 50 years, but we won't hear you or anyone else blaming alcohol or cars for that.

Get real son, I was considering a vote for you but the gun "issue" is non negotiable. 10-13k average gun homicides a year is nothing for "400 million guns" and 350 million people, suicides are irrelevant also and have nothing to do with our rights.

Mass knife stabbings happen often elsewhere and here, what's next knives?

Oh by the way universal backround checks exist in all 50 states for any dealer certified to sell guns, including gun shows, have you ever been to one? You can stop the "universal backround checks" shpeal it's not working.

So far this is the only area where I have a big problem with Yang. I'm so sick of this logic, or lack of it, that somehow the number of guns is equated to the amount of crime. Why do these guys keep assuming the way to reduce shootings is to just reduce the number of guns in America? The fact is that most of the guns are owned by the most law abiding of citizens. Most of those guns are currently locked in a safe in the owners house. The guns used in these shootings were not bought at a gun store or a gun show. All the proposals of various gun control laws only serve to disarm the law abiding, they would make no difference in any of these shootings. They keep making these tragic murders into another opportunity to garner support for their unconstitutional efforts to criminalize the armed citizen. Many of us know what this really is and always has been. This is how they slowly dissolve the 2nd Amendment out of existence. The people should not trust a government that doesn't trust them. There's only one reason to collect all those guns they are so scared of and it has nothing to do with the kids in that school or the boy on that stoop. Just look at the crime stats on the communities that have strict anti-gun laws. They have the highest crime rates, especially crimes involving guns. So how's that working out for them? The communities with the highest percentage of gun ownership have the lowest crime rates. Coincidence?
#####
HUMAN ...Mr. Yang is due for some significant insight courtesy of me by next week at his campaign address.

#####
Nobody wants to see the president break down and cry. It sucks, I like Andrew Yang. I dont like gun control advocates or the thought of infringing upon gun rights but Yang is a good guy. I'd like to see him win the presidency, but I just dont see it happening. People want a strong president who wont cry like that in front of people. I dont think hes weak, but many people will. In all honesty I dont think he could handle the stress of being president.
#####
Yang said that we need to have will to improve poorer place and change the culture. And I could not agree more I only hope the method of this can be uniform enough so that it can be passed into law. This is because Improving opportunity and infrastructure in economically Poor zones is going to do more for lowering gun violence than gun restrictions could ever do. Yang seems like a very Mindful And intelligent  candidate that would definitely be one of my top choices

I dont believe in this idea for Guns. Guns should just not be infringe. I would say this. Gun owners have gun safes and keep access to these safe very secure. I dont believe in gun suppression i believe more of gun understanding. Background checks are universal already look up your facts. I believe in a system failing at times. Failing to notify when a mental patient has been released without being put back in the system that he/she is released. I believe that anyone should be allowed to conceal carry as long as they are law abiding citizens and aren't clinically disabled. I dont mean mental treatment that already bans you from purchasing a firearm during the treatment period until you have been cleared by a mental physician. That shouldn't ban you because of several mental illnesses that are treatable and curable. Automatic Firearms are BANNED........ we only have semi-automatic firearms. Rifles, Shotguns, pistols all are semi-automatic. AR-15 and Ak-47 sold at your local gun shop are the civilian version which are Semi-Automatic Rifles. Gun free zones are victim zones because many shootings have occurred in gun free zones so this side I don't agree with Yang. I am more Moderate Leaning Democrat but please don't start taking steps into the 2nd Amendment. Our Bill of Rights are our birth rights as Americans. Dont Infringe upon them Another thing is Many of the proposed bills protect Criminals rather than law abiding Citizens. A criminal falls in your property while trying to rob you has the right to sue you for injury. A criminal shot by you while robbing you at gun point has the right to sue you and you could be prosecuted for murder because apparently the justice bureau believes you shouldn't defend yourself until the last second when your back is against the wall and you have no options left facing a gun barrel pointed at you then your allowed to use force to defend your property and your life, if you do it before you might be charged as a murderer. Whoever doesn't believe me please fact check me I have spoken to many Cops, Sheriffs, and even Lawyers about this. You will be facing charges specially in States like California and New York. These states don't believe you have the right to defend yourself unless your options are spent also they are seeking to ban armor, another thing is armor is usually used when people are scared of getting shoot by a stray bullet and it happens in cases when police activity on high against gangs or other criminals. Their excuse to ban armor is because 1 shooter every 100 shootings happens to use a vest which isn't even bullet proof..... meaning no Kevlar. Also Kevlar comes in different grades and protects you up to a certain caliber of round fires from a certain gun. For all those unaware of gun rights and just gun facts go to your local shooting ranges or gun shops they will inform you and before you even dream of buying a gun they will ask for ID, proof of address, 100bucks for background check, sometimes 2nd proof of address, SS# because they need to know your not a felon or mental patient. Look up Brady Law. This is mandated. Federal level. These fake announcements have to stop. Yang so far i have loved many things you said but this I can't stand behind. You might lose my vote for this one. I come from a home that has had Military people and Law Enforcement in the family. You want to know what makes people safer. Americans keeping up with their rights and keeping up with their community checking that their taxes are being used properly being informed of corruption and misuses of media biased. Also guys remember the Bullet Proof Backpacks being sold.... yet they are trying to ban them..... because they are not safe..... because 1 criminal used after many cases... Gun Safety Laws and Red Flag Laws are Unconstitutional. They dont prevent it. Many Cops and Sheriffs have spoken about it several times they repeat one thing all the time "CRIMINALS DONT FOLLOW LAWS ONLY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS DO"....... Leave the law abiding alone lets vote for improving the crack down on black market guns and gun trafficking.... lets deal and pay attention to bullying in school..... lets look at areas where gangs prey on our young trying to recruit them..... these are better areas that dont stop a law abiding citizen from having the means of defending themselves in case of break ins, also guys Conceal Carry gun owners cant help on mass gun shootings because of "Vigilante Murder" thats when someone goes with their weapon and tries to shoot someone down just because they are stopping the mass murder. Its horrible law that has made it impossible for many Gun Owners from intervening because of the lawsuits that will drop on them if they do this. If not by the criminals family it will come from the state. Lets be more pro guns not to allow vigilante actions but just deterring gun violence because of the fact that Criminals will now fear if Civilians are armed if they have a conceal carry. What is a criminal fears Law Abiding Citizens with Conceal Carry who are ALLOWED to INTERVENE in SHOOTINGS. Lets talk about that Church Shooting that was stopped because of a Citizen with His AR-15. We dont talk about these or hear about these because it doesnt push that agenda to is geared towards banning guns.
#####
It's easy to say what you know everyone wants to hear. With how he tried pushing fake tears I now lean towards this being a play to get elected. And for that 1000.00 a month....
Amazon and google will simply stop selling your information. No one works to give it away. If you read the small print on amazon and google u will see that you forfeited your information by using there services.

Yang wants to give $2000/mo to eligible Americans. And he  proposes a more comprehensive  social welfare network. Where the money coming from? He says tax the rich, tax the corporation, tax digital ads, and tax this and that. In the end all these taxes come from the pocket of the working-stiff. Just look in the rear view mirror of politic. The current mountain of taxes levied on the working-stiff were once proposed by political candidates  who promised to tax the rich, the corporation, the vices, the polluters, and so on. Every 4 years, the American people show the world they are eternal optimists or fools.

How do I join the "Yang Gang"?

The culture if homicide is correct.  It's not the guns, it's the way parents are raising their children.
#####
He isn't a democrat by definition. He is an independent running under democrat. He takes all the good things from liberals, democrats, and republicans and use it to figure out solutions to economic and social problems of America. Its one reason why MSM does not like him because they can't define which political party he aligns with. Which makes him dangerous to all of his opponents and MSM.
#####
To be clear, I am not affiliated with any political party. Yang isn't just the best choice. He's the ONLY choice!  Looking at logic, no one else has any idea what to do with our situation. They are all career politicians. As their careers have made enemies on the Republican side, Yang has not. The Republicans will likely work with him. The other candidates may have ideas, but those  ideas will be shot down by their Republican counterparts if they are elected for political reasons.  Obama struggled forever to get anything done because the republicans would just not cooperate, even if they agreed with his approach. Yang can cross lines and get agreements because he is not a politician and he has ideas that work. There are many republicans that want to change the world. These are just people. But they are in such competition for winning elections, they forget what is important. With Yang as President, they don't have to worry about competition. They can focus on solving problems. If his ideas work,  then everyone can get on a new path.
#####
Man, really sucks to be 16. Yang's one of the only things that's seriously had me invested in politics, yet I can't give him support.
I'm begging on behalf of my generation, vote him into office!

Yang should receive an Academy Award for that performance.

ying yang no different that the rest of the vile disgusting communist democrats..... they hate america and constitution

A personalised firearm system wouldn't be a terrible idea, as long as it was a completely self contained system, no wireless contact to outside sources. It would be a nightmare if the government was able to remotely disable every gun in the country at once. And it absolutely shouldn't be a requirement, like he said. It would also have to be tested and proven that it was reliable. No gun owner has time to fix a faulty fingerprint scanner during the time when they actually need the gun most.

I really love Yang but he needs to educate himself on guns. There is already essentially a ban on automatic weapons. Red flag laws  are an open door to violations of the 4th amendment. And the technology to personalize guns is unreliable at best. Imagine needing your gun to defend your life and your grip suddenly doesn't recognize you.

Andrew Yang is making sense. Last night‚Äôs debate demonstrated to this voter why Yang deserves our full attention. Two main¬† Andrew Yang policy positions resonate with me, Universal Income and how the¬†Robot Apocalypse can bring our divided nation together.¬† The dark side of automation is a looming issue creating deep chasms in our already divided nation.¬† Consider how well our current Executive in chief exploited this group‚Äôs legitimate feelings of economic loss. We are in the midst of a major transition to¬†artificial intelligence¬†(see automation).¬† The President has blamed immigrants when the clear nemesis is¬†Artificial intelligence-the advance of technology. Imagine how farmers felt during the genesis of the industrial age.

Let‚Äôs look at truck drivers. There are 3.5 million truck drivers on the road today (robot trucks will be here within 3-5 years and quickly replacing drivers). The savings are considerable ( replacing human drivers with self-driving trucks that can run all of the time) will save an estimated $168 Billion a year.¬†¬†Artificial intelligence¬†is replacing thousands of call center jobs right now. About 8% of American jobs are in the STEM field, 92% are not. The 5 most common jobs in the U.S. right now are 1) Administrative and clerical 2)¬† Retail and Sales 3) food service 4) Truck Driving 5) Manufacturing. Right now all aforementioned jobs are in the midst of a change to Artificial intelligence (automation).¬† 32% of Americans graduated from college, 68% with a high school diploma or below. 68% of Americans are working in the at-risk to automation industries.¬† ¬† We need an interim solution for the margins to keep the most at risk from going off the rails-into much more expensive societal concerns (incarceration, homelessness, drug addiction, emergency room healthcare).¬† Remember an extra $1000.00 for the average working American, living paycheck to paycheck, would largely end up right back into the economy in the form of retail, deferred car repair payments, dining out, out of pocket healthcare costs.¬† This purchase activity would result in revenue back to the states/Fed.¬† We would see the revenue back and save on societal shared marginal costs. ¬†Easy to take the jaded view and consider these payments a form of welfare. ¬†Remember that we practice corporate welfare every year by allowing companies to pay the equivalent of ZERO income taxes. ¬†Why not ask these companies benefiting from automation to provide a dividend back to all of us and especially those displaced by automation?

¬†‚ÄúThe monthly stipend, which Yang dubs the ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù is intended to ameliorate economic insecurity, wealth inequality,¬† and the other symptoms of social malaise stemming from capitalism‚Äù.

Automation is more efficient than¬† ‚Äì human labor.

Time to take a look at Andrew Yang.

From watching the recent interview of Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang by MSNBC       there is some truth about the suspicion that the Network is working against AY's candidacy. Most of the questions asked of him were seen as negatively skewed and interrogative in intent. Rather than asking Andrew to elaborate on his ideas for improving more Americans' livelihood such as his UBI scheme, he was asked the question which he had already explained in many interviews: how to finance such a costly initiative; as was also why he didn't vie for a senate position first instead of ambitiously going for the presidency, since he has no political experience. It confirms the suspicion of a deliberate attempt by MSNBC to interfere with AY's presidential candidacy.
#####
One issue candidate. Thanks for running, nevertheless.
#####
i literally can‚Äôt fathom thinking a different candidate winning and getting things done that he would get done. OUR COUNTRY NEEDS THIS MAN!!!
#####
Andrew Yang is a fantastic orator same as Obama.  He sounds very much like Elon Musk.  But.... he and Tulsi Gabbard  both fantastic orators like obama and very intelligent.  Yang's plan to help US is simply not feasible $250 x 332000000 = 85 billion per week.  I thought americans were sick of all talk and no action - that is why Donald Trump got elected - prison reform, lowering taxes, renegotiating trade deals, keeping firms in the US, reducing red tape, deal with NK etc etc etc.  DT is still the best choice.
#####
I admire a guy who can cry openly on stage. In this age where people like to tout antipathy as being "logical." Andrew Yang who shed tears by putting himself in the parents of gun victims shoes.
#####
Want to end gun violence? Stop treating guns as the problem. Gun violence is a symptom of something far more divisive and sinister, and a great example of it is the hiring practices of the leftists, further special interest as a whole. You can't take from one¬†group, further give to another without restriction or reason,¬†and not expect¬†backlash when you leave the¬†deprived without any rights past gun ownership. And when you push the narrative of controlling human emotion as a solution, further make people afraid of speaking their own mind, what exactly might you imagine the end result to be? History is filled with examples of violence which have consistently led to¬†one revolution after another, and you're all abundantly stupid not to recognize it...
#####
I'm liking this guy more and more.
#####
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBuIGBCF9jc
#####
If this guy wins as the next democrat candidate I'm gonna vote for trump. Unless bernie wins
#####
Andrew Yang: Just keeps deflecting questions or not answering them at all. the crying is all just an act. This is not a type of person we need for president. Andrew Yang: please answer How you are going to help all Americans the very 2nd question asked. the hooter is victim too. WHAT?... it looks like Yang is running to promote technology and this technology will have to come from Taiwan his home country to compete with China. Yang dumps the responsibility of guns onto manufactures. it's not  manufactures fault for what the public wants or willing to buy. Andrew Yang is not pro American Manufactures.
#####
Mr. A Yang please, let‚Äôs focus on American and no outside politics and fighting wars that cost a country billions of dollars please?
#####
MATH
#####
Shame on you MSNBC for treating Yang with 0 dignity. Not gonna bother with your brand from here on out.
#####
Bernie= old sage, Yang= young wizard. They will make america great again.
#####
I see you in that like dislike ratio Yang gang, and I like it :)
#####
it doesn't matter how anyone spins it,  all you have to do is listen to one sentence that Andrew Young says to realize what a supreme human being he is and you are drawn in to want to hear the rest of what he is saying.  He is the person needed to make up for all the shallow bravado and lost time, energy and ihaughty rhetoric that we have witnessed these last four years.  Its a no brainer - AW's timing could not be more auspicious. When the world is ready and has had enough,  the leader appears.
#####
Wow so am I only aim is BlaCK
#####
What has Donald Trump said that has indicated that hes a white supremacist?
#####
Andrew Yang sucks for saying that about President Trump. Shame
#####
This upload is absolutely childish in every sense of the word.
#####
Shame on CNN and C-SPAN. You need to focus on his policies and not ask stupid questions. Andrew Yang doesn't need any white nationalists, domestic terrorists or hate groups' votes at all.  Time to put educated reporters out there. Such a shame.
#####
Embarrassing move by CSPAN. What kind of news is this?!
#####
Andrew Yang's 3 big policies are: 1) the Freedom Dividend, 2) Medicare for All, and 3) Human-Centered Capitalism. He has 100+ policies on his website, which detail his vision for an America of opportunity, freedom, equality, and abundance. Check it out at yang2020.com/policies
#####
Forgot to mention he forgot to mention he‚Äôs a rapist and a racist and a criminal
#####
What a twat
#####
yeah because trump is at least in some way a white personally I like to believe that hes just an idiot and self absorbed
#####
Lol at least he‚Äôs stating facts... unspoken and intellectually a forward thinker  ... what a combination üî•
#####
Lol fucking C-Span. Doesn't bother to upload any other footage of Yang other than the most "controversial" statement he makes because he was asked about it directly. Way to smear a dude trying to do what's right for everyone in this country. Shame!
#####
Yang fell for the media‚Äôs trap. I feel like this is gonna come back and bite him  in the future.
#####
That made me like Yang less. Utterly ridiculous.
#####
Cmon guys it‚Äôs really not cool to show such a superficial side of him /:
#####
Please look into Andrew yangs plans more deeply . You will like what you see . Vote yang
#####
Cspan is poop
#####
Fuck u c span.. biased cunts
#####
whose ever saying shame on you cspan can suck my irish cock. interesting clip
#####
FUck you C-span
#####
Yang isn‚Äôt gaining support, he‚Äôs buyers no bots. All the responses are the same. Wake tf up.
#####
lmfao looks like 561 fat 8Chan & The_Donald users found ways to down vote Youtube...
#####
C-Span fuckers
#####
You know you'd get more views on your YT channel if you gave him positive footage?
#####
The C must stand for crap
#####
MORE LIKE CSPAM. Fuck you guys for not getting the real word of this mans vision out. Disgusting!
#####
aaaaaaaaand u lose
#####
You guys are terrible for choosing this clip of all things to show
#####
I love white people but most the time, yall stupid as fuck. Let the asians speak. He is the best ever......
#####
Fuck you, C-SPAN. Garbage network, go back to and do the only thing you're useful for - recording White House Correspondence Dinners
#####
FUCKING DELETE THIS GARBAGE
#####
welp i am no longer voting for him. I thought he wasnt apart of this dumbass bandwagon of people calling everything racist but i was wrong
#####
for the record.. he said we gotta judge people based on their words and actions... he never once called him a White Supremacist.
#####
Some people get it but a lotta ya'll don't seem to.  Trump want's to be considered a White Supremacist so what's wrong with people referring to him as one?  It's not an attack when someone identifies with it unless you're telling me Trump is not allowed to identify with that.
#####
The republican loves white supremacist.
#####
30 seconds of anything Yang says is more than C-span deserves on their channel after doing the man like this, shame on you.
#####
Stupid move Andrew yang. We the people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 like you in 2020. But we don't like you calling him stupid liberal s***. Don't sell out to the alt left. Don't be one of that puke Green Team. Do you notice that this is the only Andrew Yang video on the internet that has more dislikes than likes? Watch carefully. Because we're still voting for you, but that can change easily if you continue to engage in mudslinging like the other 95 brainless Democratic candidates running against you. You will not beat Trump at a name-calling war. And you will lose all of your conservative supporters. You can't win this election without us.
#####
Shame on you cSpan looks like you're "fake news"
#####
So Trump is kicking the shit out of China in trade and all sudden an Chinese American steps in to run for president? Hmmmmm
#####
Damn yang I supported up until this point now you got me second guessing that
#####
More AI is a good thing. It makes us much more productive and dramatically lowers costs. Labor is a resource that we want to use minimally. People enjoy leisure, but they also enjoy higher purchasing power. 
If AI eliminates truck drivers, well now those people are freed up to do other things. And that means shipping costs go down, goods costs go down and we're all richer. That extra wealth is what creates employment elsewhere and grows an economy.
#####
USE ME AS A C-SPAN IS DISGUSTING AND I FULLY SUPPORT YANG BUTTON
#####
Here we go again, Media always trying to divide us again and again! I guess if we united then it will hurt most of the rich people that are a stand or supported by Corruption of Governments!!
#####
Another Parrotcrat. Worthless candidate.

1000$ more like 1000¬•. What a fucking sham, and Americans fell for it, AGAIN. We STILL have to suffer through Bernie's presence, but this guy was for sure the 2020 Bernie "grassroots underdog."
#####
I used to think C-SPAN was unbiased. The other day they were having callers on a radio show talk about whether or not they believed electability will play an important role for a democratic win this election. The ONE caller who mentioned Andrew Yang was cut off just as she was going to talk about how he is bringing new ideas to the table...
#####
Asian shit
#####
Yep the old racest card when you have nothing left in the arsenal bag... boring answers and predictable
#####
I want to know his answer to this question? "Is Taiwan a separate nation from China?"
#####
You could tell he was not feeling that question and the answer he gave. He felt pressured.
#####
I was going to vote for yang but not after this.
#####
What a moronic economic illiterate !!
#####
Well, if it quacks like a duck...
#####
Andrew Yang -= asshole
#####
Surprise to hear say that about Trump. Never said it before until now. Seems like people were pushing him to say something he didn‚Äôt want. He couldn‚Äôt say it with a straight face. He was looking up the whole time.
#####
Yang is Cancelled
#GabbardGang
#####
You had one job.


*_YOU HAD ONE JOB C-SPAN_*
#####
poor yang feeling the pressure to be something he isn't. Can he maintain his integrity? We shall see.
#####
play identity politics see how it works out. I'm out.
#####
Trump is wholly pro-American but I wouldn't say he's a white supremacist. Sad to hear Andrew is falling into the same circle of liberals he called out on.  If this short clip is taken out of context, please let me know.
#####
Wish he wouldn't have took that view. It's obvious donald duck not white supreme. T'is far too self centered too concern himself with the origin of species. I Like Andrew though. Smart cookie.
#####
The thumbs down on the video are directed at you c-span. Not Yang.
#####
CNN-SPAN
#####
based on the fact the Trump believes in boarder security like most countries do
#####
I personally don't like what Yang was saying there. However, I think the media is trying to screw him over by asking him clickbait questions. Also 30 seconds just to smear him and this is coming from CSPAN. Sorry but CSPAN take this L. #YangGang
#####
And there it is...I had a feeling Yang would be different from the other Democrats but alas.
#####
This man can save this country from economic disaster. All you can do is post click bait! Your despicable!
#####
Sorry Dems, you're being forced to having Joe Biden as your candidate.  Maybe if y'all weren't so much into emotional reasoning and actually used critical thinking, you wouldn't be in this spot.

Quit trusting MSM, quit focusing on cheap talking points and quit making your lives about Trump.  Your house is corrupt and you need to clean it so you can get Yang or Tulsi in there.  

You have nobody to blame but yourself.  Same crap the Reps went through when the blue repubs split from the right-wingers.  Get it together and get a WORTHY candidate to pit against Trump.
#####
He got popular and gave into the radicals. Sad to see.
#####
When Dems have NOTHING to help Americans it's the race card how sad.   Calling Americans who voted for our president white supremacists is now the norm for Dems.  They haven't a policy platform nothing.  This is typical.  Spewing lies and hate that's the DNC and candidates.
#####
Buddha vs Christianity, who are you going to believe true American Christians.
#####
riiiiigght, and all hope is lost...
#####
lol, I see the right wing cucks have had their feelings hurt and hurried to vote it down.  whiny ass bitches are so predictable.
#####
My comments is dissenter so youtube don‚Äôt delete this
#####
Listen to him closely, Mr. Yang is a commie spy skagg. In an earlier more correct age he would have been hanged for espionage.
#####
It's frightening  when telling someone who doesn't like our country to go back to where they came from is considered "white supremacy."  I mean wow.
#####
Yang is a piece of garbage for saying this. He can shove his $1000 up his tookus.
#####
Tell that to A$AP Rocky.
#####
DEMOCRATS ARE THE REAL RACISTS
#####
Coming from a communist, that doesn't mean much.

The parasitic YangBots are out in force defending their Messiah of Gibs.
Wouldn't want to jeopardize that sweet free money you're all hoping for, now would we?
#####
This lost all respect I had for the the guy. Yang will lose.
#####
Yang sounds like a Parrot for CNN, but then all the Demtards sound the same Parrot recording for CNN!
#####
Bullshit c-span!
#####
Andrew Yang Will Never Be President
#####
America is a white country.
#####
Yang said something else racist.  He said he is afraid that robotic trucks will cause white truck drivers to lose their jobs, which may cause them to kill his Asian children.  I don't know why he mentioned "white" truck drivers.  I'm tired of this anti-white crap.
#####
The left is sh*t and by far has the most racists... By far! Straight out the mouth of a bi racial black man. Not all of us non whites are brainwashed sheep.
#####
I'm black and feel only dumbasses say that dumbass shit and obviously have not researched well. .. 1 thing alone. The Crime bill... & I can name a dozen other things.
#####
Yang is another clown and cspan is rocking with the fake news sound bites.
#####
Really disappointed that this is the only clip being uploaded. Shame on you c-span :/.
#####
ALL!! EVERYONE OF "THE FOUNDING FATHERS" WERE WHITE! THIS IN ITSELF PROVES THEY WERE RACISTS!! YES!!! WHITE SUPREMACISTS TOO!! YES INDEED!!! NOT ONE N WORD IN THE ENTIRE GROUP!!!!
#####
Young lost my vote
#####
That's the first video I saw with so many dislikes about yang...I think yang just blew his chance. What an Idiot?
#####
Based on his words and actions, Trump is a Zi0nist. He‚Äôs very proud of his Tree of Life award from his Chabad Lubavitch handlers. 
Well..I guess in roudabout way, Yang is correct, since Zi0nists are racists / supremacists.
#####
Excuse me your democrat is showing
#####
I just watched over an hour long coverage from this C-Span report and this is the only official thing they upload?  This is some BS right here on C-Span‚Äôs part.
#####
This is the end of his run for the WH. Based on Yangs words he is a Cultural Marxist..im done and I wasted 20$ on his good idea of UBI..very sad to see him come out of the closet on what type of economics he actually does support, and it's not capitalism that  doesn't start at 0.
#####
why are people saying oh no!  he shouldn't have said that!   when he and EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE should be saying EXACTLY that!!!  yang has guts and integrity!
#####
There is a new documentary series on Netflix that fully supports this conclusion... it's called "The Family".  Go watch it. #YangGang #Yang2020 #BoomersForYang

There is two genders Male and Female

@2:20  - Clarification - The Freedom Dividend would not be mandatory replacement for government assistance programs.  It would be choice replacement by recipients. It those receiving assistance would rather receive the dividend they could. If they later decided they'd rather backtrack and receive the assistance program they could. It is believed by many that the Freedom Dividend would be a better choice thus eliminating programs due to people not wanting them by preference of the dividend.
#####
Your going to have to implement ubi because there won't be enough jobs and your gonna have to educate everyone for free because the problems we will have will be to complex to handle with basic education and all the basic jobs will be automatic

UBI will create inflation... isnt that what American needed? Capital injection instead of quantitative easing
#####
I'm totally for UBI but I also advocate that it needs to implemented with what I call UBL (Universal Basic Learning).  For instance government provided free Maker Spaces in the same concentration as Starbucks.  Then people will have someplace to go with their new free time to experiment with self actualized learning.  We will be amazed with the proliferation of new ideas that will come out of this.  Education as is now practiced is an outdated concept that is left over from the industrial era.  New ideas will bubble up from the bottom once people realize their ideas are valid too.  Our current system of education into new technologies is coming from the top down and is severely holding back the rate of new invention and making to few people very wealthy.
#####
Obama‚Äôs government was dirty and those who defend it are dirty.  Biden and Obama were partners in crime...  Obama was spying on Trump from the very beginning.  He wanted his crook partner Hillary in office so he could continue to be involved in his criminal activity, knowing if Trump got elected,  he would be exposed.  One of the biggest crooks and the worst Presidents in our history. These thieves in the Dem party will do anything to stay in the shadows. WHEN WILL THESE CROOKS BE PUT IN JAIL?
#####
If I had $1000 this month I would‚Äôve bought food & refilled my Inhaler.
I wouldn‚Äôt be wheezing & hungry right now if Andrew Yang were President.
#####
It solves the health care for his term if he comes president
#####
UBI on top of Social Security would be incredible! Think about how many people are working past the retirement age instead of enjoying their golden years worry of financial insecurity. Some elderly still have a mortgage and with UBI they could pump that extra money into it and pay it off faster and then retire.
#####
I think Gates and Bezos will end up endorsing him too because they would rather submit to a VAT than a wealth tax.
#####
Watch the meme candidate win
#####
For anyone curious about inflation, just a few thoughts to bear in mind. 1. In the last three decades productivity of individual workers has skyrocketed. The real cost of raw materials has - for the most part - gone down. Only three sectors of the economy have risen dramatically: healthcare, housing, and education. Salaries - in real terms - have sharply declined. Taxes on businesses have  dropped to record lows. When products cost less and less to manufacture, there is increasing deflationary pressure. Inflation can be bad. Deflation is absolutely catastrophic. Automation and AI will further reduce cost of manufacture, cost of wages, levels of taxation (payroll tax), and cost of raw materials. Quite simply, the only weapon we have to stave off deflation will be increased taxation and distribution of cash to keep the wheels of the economy turning. It really doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt like socialism (or what you think that word means), simple maths is irrefutable.
#####
3:03 thats not how inflation works...
#####
UBI will not drive steady inflation - that is not how inflation works. Prices go up when the proportion of money in circulation to goods in circulation goes up. UBI does not change that proportion, it just keeps recirculating money.


Think of it this way: whether that 1k per month gets spent by someone with a lot of money (as happens now) or gets spent by someone with less money (as will happen when a person with a low income receives more money from UBI than they pay out in a consumption tax), the same total amount of money is still getting spent on the same total value in goods.


However, if the 1K per month helps drive micro businesses, that could increase total productivity, which would then increase the amount of goods in circulation. In theory that could drive deflation, but it won't because the Fed very closely monitors these factors and makes sure to print enough money to avoid deflation. Deflation is terrible.
#####
Love the reporter with the glasses at the end speaks facts
#####
We need solutions, not stories from people running for president! Go Yang!!!
#####
To create a fund for $1000/week for 18-death, Yang is going to introduce a VAT on goods. A value-added tax (VAT), known in some countries as a goods and services tax (GST), means that the richer you are, and the more goods you buy, the more you contribute to the fund that supplies the $1000/m to those who need it because of their jobs/career being taken by a machine (the fourth part of the industrial revolution). You can opt in and receive $1000/m whether you are Elon Musk or a single person with a learning impairment or if you have a drug addiction. But drug addiction is likely to become less because $1000/m changes the decision power a person has, allows them to take a chance, and to plan ahead (HOPE). Currently many people feel no hope. Suicide and drug overdoses have overtaken car accidents as the leading cause of death bc they have no hope or security. People aren‚Äôt having children for the same reason.
#####
UBI is not inflationary! 
1. He's not printing money ! So its not inflationary
2. Competition is deflationary . I.E Ebay may increase their prices but Amazon might keep their prices the same in order to stay competitive. Who do you think the customer is going to prefer?
#####
yang isnt a venture capitalist. have a bit of research yea
#####
It's Brian Cheung I went to school with him lol
#####
AGAIN Yahoo!!! You kill me by bullshit interviews by not doing your job on researching his policies ! Still lucky I can't just change all my main emails off of Yahoo mail yet. üòëüòëüñïüñïüñï
#####
Best choice ever!
#####
1:38  "Do you think its actually gonna solve the problem in that people don't have enough money? by just giving them money?"     this question deserves a darwin award.
#####
She clearly did not do any research on Andrew yang
#####
Yang has my vote. I support  Trump and still do. Yang has better ideas though.
#####
THIS WOMAN IS A POOR INFORMED AND YET HOSTING FINANCE CHANNEL. WHERE'S THE INFLATION WHEN FED PRINTED TRIL OF DOLLARS QE OR OBAMA BAILED OUT WALL STREET???
#####
Why use the term free money like that is she slow? First off without the manufacturing workers doing all the hard labor none of these companies would have been successful therefore their hard work has lead to these companies to be in position to pursue AI. If you think we shouldn't get anything back for that you're insane it's not free at all lol. Not to mention the VAT guarantees there won't be any serious level of inflation.
#####
Good Elon Musk recognizes a fellow man of intellect in Andrew Yang wise choice sir.
#####
How can you call a national nonprofit a capitalist venture. Venture capitalist is not a way to describe Andrew yang
#####
LETS GOOOOO YANG GANG!!!
#####
Andrew Yang for President !
#####
If you raise your prices to scalp me,  I will take my business elsewhere.... Or start a business undercutting your prices.... Have a rotten, bloodsucking day
#####
Make
America 
Think
Harder
#####
Meme Gang
#####
Elon Musk who takes drugs regularly and whose company is teetering on bankruptcy endorses Yang....uh huh
#####
Immigrants taking our jobs is precisely the opposite of what AY is saying he says automation is stealing jobs by the millions. Note that during the GFC some democracies spent like crazy to stop going under, one granted every school in the country enough money to build anything they wanted and it worked! Money spent in a community cycles back through it multiple times and each time the government gets to tax it  etc. etc.
#####
president yang..........yes.............
#####
Giving $1,000 a month to every American Adult will actually help the economy 'coz people will still spend the money and pays tax.
#####
Before you go gaga over Yang's $1000 a month, find out if it cuts into or out your Social security Benefits?
#####
Way to go Andrew Yang!
#####
"He would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important" Elon Musk is glitching
#####
Smart men; wise choice.
#####
I've been waiting for this news. I knew musk would endorse him! They're basically the same person in parallel lifelines xD
#####
i cant believe these idiots actually work for Yahoo Finance whatever that is...pathetic, we must live in a simulation.
#####
listening to three idiots who have no experience or degree in economics talk about UBI or "if we can afford it" makes my brain hurt.  Yang has explained (and anyone with half a brain) can understand and figure out how it is paid for.  Additionally, when she makes a comment about inflation b/c people have more money I vomited on the floor b/c she is so stupid.  The process would not devalue our currency only someone who has never taken basic economics would/could report something like that, just terrible people on TV are so uneducated and report misinformation
#####
Honestly the whole inflation thing is funny to me cause its a question thats asked without any true thinking...if  something goes up then there will be someone who comes along and will be like "i can do this for less" and will make a killing. If tacobell makes their tacos 7 bucks ima do it for lower prices or the prices they had originally lol it kills greed and encourages economic  competition.
#####
The media trying to beat down good policy again.. they do it on all good policy and good candidates.. every time.
#####
L like yang very good men
#####
Omg guys. Yang loved The Cure when he was young... duhhhh, sitting on television means stupid?
#####
YangGang2020!!!
#####
Elon Musk endorsed Yang because he's a memes guy?? Again, arrogant.
#####
You need a whiteboard and actuaries?  Do you guys even prepare for shows? I'm not talking about make up.. so let's see... You know beforehand that you'll be discussing a technocratic economic policy called UBI and you didn't go to Andrew Yang's page or watch a video where all these questions are answered WITH studies listed? How arrogant.
#####
Andrew yang for president
#####
It‚Äôs so frustrating hearing the same dumb hosts ask the same dumb questions about UBI that Yang and many other have answered a ridiculous amount of times. Just watch ONE damn video of his explanations. It will not cause inflation Jesus Christ
#####
The lady talking .she can now use   her own fund,when sofiia Ai take over her job.she can snub UBI.
#####
Pretty BS Take
#####
The Universal Basic Income is a policy that must be put into place as soon as possible. When automation starts peeling away all of the jobs what do people do? If UBI is in place we are giving everyone the power to work out their income situation before automation wipes out their jobs. UBI is a very well thought out because it is one idea that will solve many problems in the future to include giving the options to single unwed moms, removing the boot on everyone throat where 50% are living paycheck to paycheck. UBI is a humane plan to prepare people to deal with the harsh reality of automation. 
We need a leader who understands this. Yang has demonstrated that he has thought long and hard about this being the only democratic candidate that is pointing these realities out! We must act now, we must put Andrew Yang in the White House for all of America.
#####
It's not free money morons. They never mention the "free money" companies get via subsidies, do they? Yang mentions changing our system to VAT-TAX and holding corporations accountable... Our data is now worth more than oil. Automation, even handheld tech *REMOVES HUNDREDS of man-hours and manpower from your community.* The money is there.
#####
DO NOT Compare Andrew Yang to Herman Cain please!! Genius vs Moron comparison
#####
Well-informed crew.
#####
Traditional media sound so fake.
#####
OMG...  All 3 of the people on this panel are complete flocking idiots! "Oh my God Skippy, but then, like, everybody will have  like, a thousand dollars and then, like all the companies will be, like, they have a thousand dollars so let's just, like, raise the prices on stuff!"

WTF???? PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING!
#####
Why would they make a video and claim to be reporters but not do proper research????!?? This is what trump means by fake news, fo study Andrew uncle and actually listen. He‚Äôs not blabbering around like Bernie& Biden!
#####
These mf are not even listening!!!
#####
Go for it, Andrew yang

If hell freezes over and Yang wins ?? That doesnt mean everybody gets $ 1,000 a month , red tape , laws , funds , opposing democrats will stop him for sure ( 100% GUARANTEE HE DOESNT WIN )

"we need an actuary and a whiteboard not blablabla" I love it!

üëç yang is the only candidate all my friends and family agree with, regardless if they're left or right. Let's go forward.
#####
I support Yang
#####
I like what he‚Äôs saying in podcasts but can he seriously deliver on any of the stuff he‚Äôs talking about. He might be just selling us a dream like Obama. I would be worried a bit about his character as well; in that I think he could be bullied with military policy and other things
#####
Omg. Yahoo finance - are any of you trained in basic economics? Inflation caused by redistribution of wealth?! How embarassing this panel is. Especially the bird brain on the end
#####
they say they love covering politics. think Elon is supporting Yang because they're both big Twitter users. refer to the way Yang speaks as blabbing....if any of these people had spent any real time educating themselves it'd be nice.
#####
Wow these people are so naive to understand inflation, money in the hand of consumer increase purchasing power not the inflation. Money supply in the market is the factor that cause inflation.

Why not if Yang stays away from those undemocratic socialists like Bernie, Warren and AOC

Why is this bimbo calling him a "venture capitalist?"

Hi Yang Gang Family - I got lucky & found an AWESOME Andrew Yang Song! Let's get it out there. Very, very addicting! (Pardon that the Composer is bare-chested. A great voice though.) Look for the Humanity First Banner. 
YouTube Title:  New Andrew Yang Song
YouTube Channel:  Leo Francovich
#####
I think the crime rate will go down if people have more money.
#####
To all of you Andrew Yang supporters who know the data:  what are the chances of him really winning this thing? 

There is a stong "cult" behind him in the Web, but outside of that, I dont see much support (his ideas are very popular,  but the media fails to talk about him compared to Biden of Copmala).

So does he have a real shot?
#####
Thank god we can all earn 1000$ by subscribing!
#####
this has nothing to do with andrew.  this is really about universal basic income. an economists idea thats been talked about for a long time amongst other politicians in the past as far back as thomas Paine.  UBI is necessary for our technological world thats changing.

this is the differences between a politician and a human being!!!

YANG 2020
#####
With all the child abuse and neglect along with animal abuse and neglect I think America needs home inspections for parents and dog owners, and I'm a right winger.
#####
He's got norm macdonald and Dave Chappelle in his corner now.
#####
The crying was fake but I still like his views as a candidate. If his views ever change or he does not live up to them I'll add him to the list of the other uncaring psychopatha.
#####
Ya‚Äôll need to vote this man into office
#####
His reaction seemed staged? Yes, some of the emotion was real, the hug seemed genuine, however the crying did not. We‚Äôve never had a candidate who was that down to earth but wouldn‚Äôt it make for a great candidate, definitely would up the changes, plus maybe he is a good guy, let‚Äôs just hope they aren‚Äôt trying tooo hard to show everyone who he is.

Lol Andrew Yang is a weenie #betamale

How can you not cry while listening to a woman describe how one of her twins died while the other watched?
#####
One thing that would also help would be for the parents to teach their kids about firearms from a young age. Just like you‚Äôre taught to look both wars before crossing the street.
#####
Quick burn the constitution so he stops wining
#####
How do you stop kids from unintentionally shooting themself or a sibling? Teach them about guns and gun safety. It‚Äôs that simple, my mom had a gun in the house as long as I can remember but she taught my brother and myself about it and that it was NOT a toy.
#####
I don‚Äôt appreciate the fake cry. All that for no tears. üôÑ im not into liars.

Hopefully he can teach a class on crying without tears. Pretty darn amazing.

#####
well props to his sympathie, but his solution is garbage the only thing hes doing is making the goverment pay for the new guns from the taxes you pay which wont make it "free" and just give the Gun lobby/industrie more money. Dont get me wrong Yang has some realy good ideas but he failed on this topic.
#####
Can he also discuss how many times children were saved by guns he wants to take away from law-abiding citizens?
#####
Empathy has a cost, you can spontaneously weep

MAMA SAYS DONT VOTE FOR CRY-BABY PRESIDENTS WHO REFUSE TO STUDY TYRANNY AND DEMOCIDE.


No background checks !!!!!!!    They are just lists of gun owner which gov has always uses to confiscate guns !!!!!
The real solution here is to:
1  arm all our venues
2 create training venues for both police and citizen.
3 Allow citizens to patrol with open and conceal carry 
4 Give citizens a police radio to report while patrolling
5 Allow citizen patrolling in any venue.
6 Allow conceal carry for all citizens in most venues.


THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DISARMED ALL OUR CITIES.....AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED BY GUNS !!!!!


DEMOCRATS REMOVED THE DETERRENT TO PSYCHOS AND CRIMINALS WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.     DEMOCRATS CAUSED ALL THESE DEATHS !!!!!!


INCLUDING THE 50+ SCHOOLCHILDREN AND TEACHERS KILLED IN THE DEMOCRAT DISARMED CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS.


VOTE !!!!    And Remove all Democrat Politicians in 2020.

A Quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero - Addressing the Roman Senate in the year (43 B.C.)

"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. 
An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. 
But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, 
heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; 
he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, 
he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, 
he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, 
he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear."
#####
Fake crying is for babies and women.
#####
WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO FOR ISRAEL
#####
Terrible acting skills wtf
#####
He has more actual proposals and plans than anyone (Bernie is close) but the media completely fails to acknowledge his candidacy as legitimate. Thank goodness for youtube, where people can seek out multiple vantage points of the actual news amidst the dross that we are fed, and can form a more informed opinion instead of just swallowing the crap we're given from mainstream media. props to NBC for this video, despite the fact they are indeed mainstream media.
#####
so fake~~
#####
what a clown...
#####
give up your guns! Look, you made the yellow man cry because of your freedoms!
#####
You could tell that he wasn't "trying" to feel the emotions and felt them naturally
#####
Yang is stupid
#####
Irresponsible gun owners
#####
I‚Äôm not an American. But I just want to say that he cried exactly the way my Chinese father cries. Both not with much tears, but their expressions are exactly the same
It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt really want to cry, and are trying very hard suppressing it. Really like my father ha
#####
I saw this in another YouTube comment saying people were criticising him for ‚Äòcrying like a baby.‚Äô

A reddit user reportedly said:

 ‚ÄúHe cries like a Father‚Äù 

If he doesn‚Äôt win this election, I‚Äôm not sure what our future will truly hold.
#####
What's this? Human emotion? STATISTICS? someone better tell Yang that's not how politics work in this Toxic country
#####
Yang paints a picture of a beautiful possible future. Doesn‚Äôt get stuck on all of the problems that face us but focuses on really thoughtful and innovated solutions.
#####
what does a "personalized gun" mean? im still confused by that
#####
BETA MALE.

America...it's time. It's time for you to finally ban guns.

Lost some respect for him

That fake cry though üòí

#####
Hes holding back a laugh at the start

Yeah I'm sure these comments aren't being "curated". Laughable crocodile tears.
#####
The cries looked fake to me.
#####
I'm very much anti-gun control, but it's nice to see somebody who isn't a complete psychopath running for president
#####
How to take advantage of emotions to be elected... sorry Andrew, but fake crying won't work.
#####
Hmm not 1 tear, oh yea he's touched for sure. I've had a firearm  around me since I've been able to know what a gun is & never been shot because I was taught correctly. The leading cause of teen deaths is by vehicles but you will never hear anyone talking about keeping teens out of vehicles.
#####
So fake!  Imagining "it was one of them" so he could force himself to tear up.. Pathetic BETA MALE!
#####
A bunch of Yang npc‚Äôs in here
#####
Hey gang, bet you haven't seen Yang wielding a sword. https://youtu.be/5cOBuxxPfmI
#####
I‚Äôll vote for him if he gets it.
#####
Because he‚Äôs a normal human being, not like millions of Republicans.
#####
If Andrew Tang doesn‚Äôt win, maybe I should retire in another country.
#####
This is the man we need
#####
Hold on lemme pause (cries) then just explains his agenda like a robot
#####
Fake Cries.
#####
here, a man shows his humanity. thank you, mr yang
#####
My president. Humanity for humanity.
#####
"4.6 million children live in homes with guns, *hundreds* get shot because of it every year"......Wait, so you just don't understand how statistically low that is ? How many children live in homes with cars, and how many die in car accidents every year? Probably a similar ratio, so should we ban cars too?
#####
What a stupid question. It‚Äôs the parents responsibility to keep their children safe. We always point the finger and never take responsibility. Start taking responsibility for your carelessness. Also Yang was trying to emotionally appeal to his audience by fake crying.
#####
Had Yang's book from the library from sept to Oct, nobody put a hold on it during that time but it was a wealthy library so. Anywho, my first impression is he has a very negative view of how labor works in terms of evolution. I'm ignorant as well, but I am going to say industries die and that causes new industries to grow. The premise to his work is that when industries die, then nearly everything is dead. It just seems humans can create wants and needs. This gets into psychology  of wants versus need and if that becomes mainstream then the American dream might be dead.
#####
He appeared before 15 college students and a grandmother. The eff outta here

This is what happens when a CBS reporter used to talking about house fires and farmer markets has to talk about climate engineering and nuclear energy.  She is reading a script and has clue what she is saying.  That is why she has that lost look in her eyes.
#####
according to the IPCC earth has warmed about 1C since 1850, and sea levels have risen 340mm (13.4 inches) over that same period.  If you live to 80 you'll experience about half of that change over your entire life... and won't notice it.  Didn't the Dutch solve an actual issue with sea levels about 1000 years ago with primitive tools and for a whole lot less then $5trillion.  Aside from that, wheat, rice and other course grain production has continued to rise with the little bit of extra atmospheric CO2.  India is now an exporter of wheat, they grow so much they can't eat all of it.  So what is the actual problem Yang is claiming he will solve with $5trillion.... i know it's "climate change is real"... but what actually is the problem... where is all of the catastrophic warming we've been promised for 40 years... what actual problem is he solving ?
#####
https://youtu.be/1zrejG-WI3U

1000 a month,5 trillion dollars? So where is this coming from? Thin air?

#####
I see Andrew Yang can barely fill a room with people..lol..
#####
Yes where do you store the nuclear waste??? and why would you rape the planet for Uranium if you care about the planet.. another boneheaded idea by Andrew yang.
#####
Nuclear power is controversial all right because it's dangerous anybody in their right mind knows this except Andrew Yang.. Fukushima is still ongoing and the Aging nuclear power plants need to be decommissioned.. air disaster waiting for the next tsunami or earthquake or terrorist attack Andrew Yang needs to go go go away.
#####
Man, this was surface level coverage. Treat us like adults and talk about the actual proposals, please. Thorium reactors are not controversial in the scientific community, they're controversial with people who watch Netflix shows that demonize nuclear energy.
#####
So wait,  his solution is not to solve the problem
#####
CBS's collective misunderstanding of the relatively small health/financial impacts of the storage of spent nuclear fuel is astounding. Has a CBS employee ever been to college? That being said, thanks for seemingly supporting presidential forerunner Andrew Yang! #noplanetB #lovenotconsumerism
#####
Yang gang
#####
Google Andrew Yang instead
#####
No Yang, then we vote for Trump or won't vote at all.
#####
Yang is the only candidate that makes since for bipartisanship.
#####
Cheap
#####
This does not sound negative.  "Things are worse than we think" is his title and this clip lists all the solutions and some possible downsides.
#####
I honestly would be more receptive if a candidate actually proposed something like absolving Social Security and offering a one time lump sum payment to pay everybody off and, instead, everybody invest in a 401k plan for retirement. If they did that, they would save 400 billion a year that can go towards other things. However, every single plan they come up with says they want to implement a tax to pay for it. Also, question to Yang: does the tax come out before or after the free money you give me? If after, then why not just not give that money out and use it instead towards this? These programs they keep coming up with are horrible. They are logical in theory but absolutely terrible in practice. Look at Obamacare. It was a great idea. But, the way they implemented it was absolutely atrocious.
#####
Read the plan
Space mirrors are cited as an *absolute last resort*
The plan does not anticipate actually needing to use space mirrors if everything else goes well
#####
This is why I'm voting for yang, so Americans can have free UBI money, so we can do what's natural these days & that's getting our money that we work hard for so we can provide for our families & tax the biggest companies in the process, who the fhck wouldnt want that as a American lol

#####
it's Anti Climate Change ,  to slow down Climate Change,
PLEASE get the ideas/facts straight.
#####
Nuclear is NOT controversial in the scientific community. I repeat, it's NOT controversial in the scientific community. It's such reporting which makes it controversial amongst masses.
#####
Vote Yang 2020 !
#####
Still don‚Äôt agree? We‚Äôre going to provoke escalation in the Middle East. Secondly, you should ban smoking a huge aspect of co2. Nuclear energy worsens our environment with radiation, making it hotter without emissions. Lastly, you‚Äôre going to drive up cancer in our citizens.
#####
This is going to ruin our economy, but it is whatever people want these days, most of them don‚Äôt care or are uneducated. You can‚Äôt tax carbon, you‚Äôre going to make people overprice carbon. You can enforce legislation, but the market advances on its own terms. So what now yang? You‚Äôre going to tax us $40 for exhaling? You need to specify where the carbon comes from. Lastly, your progressive socialism will one make the sun explode with light reflecting back to space. You‚Äôre going to cause more heat in the space relativity. I agree with your zero emissions proposal for cars, but nothing else. To be 100% electric is communism. Try hydrogen, plants, electricity, solar power, and wind energy. KEEP THE MARKET COMPETITIVE! Tired of these socialist ideals.
#####
Andrew Yang's thinking is HIGHER GROUND. Come join us! üí°üëç
#####
GLAD most "Comments" below reflect how we're much SMARTER than CBS! Same with Polling.
#####
We have to address emissions by cruises and planes! Cars are minor in comparison...

He's an impressive candidate! I hope he has as much influence on policy as anyone I'm watching going forward

Well... if every SpaceX satellite was not just solar powered but also could include a big mirror around it to deflect sunlight, every little bit could help I suppose.
Perhaps when SpaceX creates newer models in the future it could be enhanced with a sun deflection feature.

We probably need to create more forests. Plant a trillion trees worldwide.
#####
This man is the truth
#####
Wow! Andrew Yang said it Out Loud!  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse than you think‚Äù Most of us know that. I have always been wondering what can we when catastrophe strikes?  He is a brave and wonderful human being. Thank you so much Mr. Yang for now letting us know we have to prepare in addition to addressing and correcting the climate CRISIS. We are all going to need that $1000 a month, aren‚Äôt we?
#####
You know you‚Äôre a threat when they have to take out the time to mar your image.
#####
Yang has alot to learn about America...... Majority of the US funds go to the Military not the citizens
#####
CBS stop politicizing nuclear waste. You idiots are destroying the environment.
#####
No mention at all of Yang's support of thorium reactor research and development? No explanation of how they're resistant to meltdowns because thorium isn't independently fissile? No explanation of how they create far less quantities of waste that's far less toxic for far less of a time than that from uranium reactors? No explanation of how other countries are far ahead of the US in research into this form of zero-emission power? All I'm hearing is more fear-mongering about outdated uranium reactors and a cheesy emphasis on his solar mirrors, which he's stated several times are merely a possibility for a worst-case scenario. This report needs a lot of work to actually serve its job of enlightening anyone.
#####
If we don't have the environment, we don't have anything really.
#####
Its over climate change, I have the high ground.-Andrew Yang
#####
Protecting the environment is the most important thing! #YangGang
#####
Do your research!!! Andrew Yang doesn't just want nuclear power he wants THORIUM NUCLEAR POWER. Thorium transmutes to uranium 233, which doesn't result in nasty waste.  Current byproducts of "normal" nuclear power transmute uranium 238 which results in plutonium (good if you want nuclear weapons/bad if you want a safer environment)
#####
ridiculously biased against Yang. disappointed in CBS
#####
First of all everything he will do will fail the only thing that won't fail this is Ubi and when Donald Trump wins 2020 Andrew Chang will get a seat on Donald Trump's cabinet to set this all up and make it all  work
#####
Do you people not see how the title says "trillion" while the description says "billion"? Pretty sad how that passed through the channel's checks.

Best Candidate Andrew Yang does not get media coverage... why?
#####
#yanggang
#####
Old guy u need  that 1k so that u can relax at home at this age.
#####
hey msnbc, your racism is showing.
#####
SO GOOD!
#####
Such a rude ignorant ugly human being.
#####
it shows Msnbc is bad and stupid!
#####
Grandpa needs go take a nap. Cranky.
#####
Terrible interviewer
#####
MSNBC is trash
#####
MSNBC is stuck in 2002. Get with the times old man.
#####
MSNBC is fake news.
#####
Almost everyone agreed that Andrew Yang is the most relatable, a direct communicator, and really intelligent person who looks out for everyone. That is the only reason he is running for President, but it seems like the main media and the DNC are working against him constantly. They don't want him to be the Democratic nominee. They are going out of their way to not mention him.. It is getting to the ridiculous point. I believe that the DNC and the main media know that if they cover or talk about Andrew Yang the same way as the rest of the other candidates, he would end up to be their nominee. If you truly listen to all the of debates and all the other sources, Andrew Yang is the only candidate that is actually looking out for everyone. Some of  you might disagree that is fine. Just compare what the rest of the candidates are putting out with what Andrew Yang is saying. 
It is amazing how well he is doing, even though, the main media and the DNC are trying their best ignore and to eliminate Andrew Yang from the running for the Democratic nominee. I guest they haven't learned their lesson from 2016's election. They kept pushing Hilary Clinton on us, which result in Donald Trump as our president. I definitely guarantee their are enough YangGang out there that will revolt if you put any other Democratic candidates as their nominee, Donald Trump will win the 2020's election for sure. To me it is so stupid to go out of your way to block a true candidate for the people. Basically, you are giving the presidency to Donald Trump. How stupid can the DNC and the main media be? WOW!!!
#####
Andrew is a new, younger, progressive democrat that is really freaking out this old timer. This really shows that MSNBC is no better than FOX as they both are selective in their candidates. At least the FOX interviewers weren't too rude about Andrew's ideas.
#####
MSNBC sucks
#####
Ok boomer
#####
Yang said data and this guy had no idea what he was talking about üòÇ
#####
Worst interviewer ever I hope he doesnt get a $1,000 a month
#####
The most terrible media all over the world.
#####
With an added $12,000 a year, I could outsource my home cleaning and have more time and money to grow my small business, I could eat out a little more and support more small businesses. I most definitely would still keep my day job while investing in my side job, aka, my small business
#####
Im going to have to consider voting for Yang after seeing the way he handled this rude interviewer. Impressive!
#####
see you in 2020, oh wait, we won't :)
#####
if Andrew Yang didn‚Äôt win democratic nominee , So I blame Media, because of  MSNBC we must support Yang2020  or Trump 2020.
#####
I don't like that old chock on the left. MSNBC FAKE NEWS CHANNEL.
#####
old dude doesn't understand what "data" is.
#####
Sooooo disappointed in Chris.  I read his book and watched him with great love and admiration in the late 90's.  How he interviewed Yang here is ridiculously and shamelessly rude!
#####
This interviewer isn't listening??? And he cut Yang off???
#####
This old guy needs to retire!
#####
MSNBC is state-owned media.
#####
MSNBC is cringe
#####
chris matthews is too old and too set in his ways. wouldnt even let Yang talk. he already made up his mind about him. 

fukin sad msnbc
#####
I hate this station more than Fox
#####
MSNBC = Most Stupid Network and Biased Channel
#####
Yea wow chris matthews tried to take a big wet slippery one all over andrew because the mainstream media can't handle the fact that they're a dying industry
#####
This guy is a moron and so is all the people who support this idea . His idea is to tax companies like Facebook and Amazon and google to pay everyone 1k a month. What do you moron think if Facebook and Google retaliate by charging us for using Facebook and Youtube  and next time buying thjng from Amazon will be more expensive ?????.
#####
Not sure whether to like for Yang or dislike for NBC ü§£
#####
I love how he interrupts him because he realizes how much sense he‚Äôs making. It‚Äôs uncharted territory for Chris.
#####
What‚Äôs the name of this boomer?üôÑ
#####
This old shill was downhearted as if the world was going to end when news of Trump's election came through even though it had been rooting for HRC win . Glad that warmonger woman was defeated  but MSNBC is till doing the same to Yang, Tulsi and Sanders. Despicable channel with despicable people.
#####
#tellthetruthmsnbc
#####
MSNBC's viewer count has been decreasing, and yet they are willing to lose 300,000 more viewers (no. of Yang Gang contributors)
#####
This old fool with all his life experiences is still a corporate shill.
#####
all the likes for Andrew Yang and dislikes for the old interviewers who don't have a clue what's happening in the country. Yang or Tulsi for the win!
#####
you guys cut him off right when he was about to explain it. Great JOB MSNBC For throwing a wrench into the wheels of democracy.
#####
#ChrisMathews you are obsolete, ignorant and a tool. Please retire and keep some dignity #yang2020 #humanityfirst #yanggang #math
#####
It's one thing to ask tough questions, and another thing entirely to just be an A-hole. This interviewer is being an A-hole.
#####
What does he and the network hate him so much lol
#####
It's not the old guy, it's his boss at MSNBC that told them to cut
#####
this old man need to go to sleep permanently.
#####
I love this guy Andrew Yang.  Read his book.  His deep-data analysis of why the institutions of healthcare, education, government, and economics are broken and no longer trusted or serving everyday American people is unbelievable.  His solutions are next-level game-changers.  This is by far the smartest person in the presidential race right now.  He's not a politician.  He's a visionary.  And if we want our country to charge headfirst into the future as a global leader we NEED THIS MAN to be president!
#####
The reason you do 1k a month is because it's enough to make a difference in people's lives but not too much that people can quit their jobs and live off of it. Even the people who work on just minimum wage make more than that a month and can still barely afford all of their bills. Guys like this don't live in poverty though, so they'll never understand.
#####
Alaska and North Dakota are both resource rich states that offer generous subsidies, tax breaks, education grants or stipends (such as the Alaska Permanent Fund) and no one refuses it! üóΩ Curiously, Alaska and North Dakota, both very red states, are also not a welfare states (federally dependent) like Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, West Virginia, etc. Go figure. üá∫üá∏
#####
The arrogance of a reporter who builds nothing.
#####
Yang handled that interview with grace, he was all smiles til the end.  What great positivity and energy from a candidate.
#####
#askpresidentyangarealquestion

What a dickhead interviewer.
#####
Automation Will destroy white collar jobs too. Goldman Sachs And others in The Wall Street now using Algorithms or machines for traders and analysts. Applications for MBA Have started to trend down. It‚Äôs just a matter of time these elites realize automation will destroy their jobs too.
#####
I used to like Matthews, but this clip just shows he turned out to be another tired, old, grumpy man bought out by the execs in corporate America!
#####
that's really rude. WTF.
#####
Fvkc u Chris Mathews
#####
I love when Zach smiles at minute 1:47 like "Yeah, Andrew's got this, no problem"
#####
Chris Matthews "why not 10k a month"

Gardener "why not give all the water this tree needs for the rest of the year today?"
#####
This old guy needs to retire! He‚Äôs old and hateful at it too.
#####
One of the worst reporter I‚Äôve seen.   

Yang2020!!!!!
#####
MSNBC is poisoned by bias. Their brain no longer functions.
#####
It shows how old people need to stop governing this country
#####
That interviewer shouldn't be so rude to our future president:))
#####
YANG FREEDOM DIVIDEND MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
#####
Chris Matthews is very dismissive and hostile.
#####
If I had an extra $1000 a month it would literally change my life. A lot of Americans are in this same situation. Vote Yang!
#####
Old rude guy
#####
It's unprofessional how he asked a questions and before the answer cut him off! I hope Andrew will remember him
#####
Don't matter.  #yanggang2020 BAYBEEE
#####
Thumbs down for this RUDE OLD FART!
#####
One of the reason people voted for Trump was because of the bias BS of the democratic media
#####
I strongly suspect this interviewer doesn‚Äôt understand how Facebook makes money.
#####
according to actual news reports,  Chris Mathews was about to have a seizure called the "chris Farley moment" and had to abruptly stop P.A.Y.  from talking. He just made so much sense!..common symptoms include nose bleeding and intense migrainesüòÅ..definitely dangerous for old people!!!üòÜ

Dumb old man, wasted his whole life without getting any smarter
#####
Wait until the money printing devalues those $1000 fiat dollars. He‚Äôs gonna have to update the dividends to adjust for inflation. BITCOIN!!!!!!!!
#####
This is why sometimes CNN is more trustworthy than MSNBC
#####
think i might not understand anymore on how he gets the dividen money. some say is gonna make the poor pay a little then before. if so then why always get from the poor again n the rich alway just gets more and more but it doesnt help the poor is like andrew takes a little from the poor and give it backto the poor andrew u need make sense this just gonna not good for them cause see they raise the product and those who on progams they dont get the dividen that have to pay MORE for the product and they didnt get your dividen money so at the end u got less of money because they pay now for the product if the product is raise price because u took a slice of amoze money. i see this with people checks they give u a raise then the product got a raise too and then u just ends up like before the raise thats why the poor always stay poor if that how they always gonna do things like this.shaking my head. ok let be hopeful that this doesnt happen with andrew dividen because it dont need to be since amozo dont pay tax and those MANICHINE self check up that no employee but custom work they take money from there so they probably make money since they dont pay employee because manchine. okay i hear people say is just gonna make amoza raise price on its product because too much money they lost is that true if is true then why not just give it to the people under rich(indivual making onemillion a year not talking about couples or smaill busisness)first i agree with megan in the view she say why give to the rich they dont need an extra onethousand. try that first and as time goes by more ROBOT takes humans jobs and they get more money from the robots and things go smooth then can give to the rich. why is give rich later because wen people get the dividen money they go support the rich that why the rich keeeps staying rich
#####
I just donated to Yang's campaign.  I normally don't give a crap and I didn't even vote in the last election.  But just like Trump, Yang isn't your typical politician.  But Unlike Trump, he actually has real good ideas outside of his Freedom Dividend plan.  They guy actually uses his brain.
#####

#####
He was very rude.
#####
Automations , Chris
#####
Wtf is up with the old guy
#####
he is rude because he is frustrated, cuz he doesn't know how to fight back logically.  Andrew Yang is throwing facts and reason to this guy.
#####
NBC needs better ‚Äújournalism‚Äù.
#####
Worse interviewer haha smh
#####
The establishment simply cannot wrap their minds around the American people getting to spend tax money, instead of allowing the politicians to play games with it.
One thing American citizens know very well: Our government has a terrible reputation for being irresponsible with money.
Maybe it's time we took back the check book, at least partially.

It makes their brains boil to think of citizens paying car payments with money they would prefer to skim into their own accounts.
They're about to break out into hissy fits when the Yang Campaign starts overtaking establishment candidates.
I can't wait to watch it happen!
#YangGang #Yang2020 #TheFreedomisReal

Imagine being that rude
#####
This old dinosaur doesn't know what he's talking about.
#####
MSNBC is full of stupid old journalists who bla bla for corrupt money... Do not try to lower Andrew Yang as you dont get it... He is a man of vision and a voice for present generation... You will need him to make yourselves and your future generation happy... Loosers disrespect great people's ideas... You can do nothing to Andrew Yang, he will be the winner...
#####
I do think it's a great concept, however 1K isn't enough. I want to get out of poverty. I'm still voting for Yang but I hope that freedom dividend increases and doesn't just stay at 1K. I want it to increase thereafter. It's a great concept but 1K isn't enough because people with disabilities are the least likely to get jobs because of discrimination against us.
#####
Shame on you MSNBC...

A lot of you don't know who Andrew Yang is.  The #YangGang invite you to research a bit about him to see why his voters are so passionate about him.  We are a collective bunch and are pushing humanity forward.  We are the revolution of reason.  For Andrew to show his empathy is what this world needs more of.  We are becoming desensitized to violence and that is very inhuman.

Unfortunately the debates don‚Äôt show off the better candidates
#####
These rich people talking about "$1000 doesn't make any difference tho" wtf
#####
I wish Yang got to expand on his point about the deficit being about expenses AND revenue. You can vastly increase revenue by having people able to spend more, through things like UBI, wage increases, Medicare for all, etc. You don‚Äôt have to just cut services, especially if doing so hurts people‚Äôs disposable income
#####
You would have to sign up for the Freedom Dividend. If you don't need it, you don't have to take it. It's your decision. The government isn't going to judge whether or not you need it.
#####
The candidate who searched ideas on google and actually ran despite having zero experience or success 

His 3 companies that failed:
Stargiver - outright failure
Venture for America - outright failure failing to meet even 4% of objectives 
Manhattan prep - sold before recession to avoid impending failure

That's the summary of experience this joker who wants to be POTUS has ...
#####
An example of trump supporters would vote for andrew yang is in the meghan mccain herself. Look on the other video where the view invited yang again and see how meghan now is cheering for the yanggang.
#####
Fucking god these mfs are so fucking annoying goddamn I hope he never has to deal with these mfs again damn
#####
$1000 money can help poor people and also families who have lower income and etc... so the way Yang  plan is not bad .
Real Democratic part don‚Äôt need to take a lot of tax for employers the good way is to build more businesses place and work place for People who live in USA. 
WTE I like YANG GANG... 
I believe to pay $1000 dollars every month is not a hard thing for YANG lol . Take out the tax for big companies like Amazon or some biggest company that have a lot income then pay üí∞.

I like the idea of a psychologist in the White House.

Yang is the best candidate to beat Trump. I love how this guy thinks.

Miss McCain says nobody need a THOUSAND DOLLARS in this table. Ok why don't you give all you money to charity and be broke ass Republican and see if you don't need 1 thousand a month. You're not even part of 1 percent in America. Over 200 million Americans struggle and live paycheck to paycheck. If you give 1k that will help immensely in the family. What a dum dum host McCain that's why her dad lost in presidency cause he's got dum policy to go to war all the time. Smh

Get off the Democratic Teat... Universal Income comes from your taxes. Our 22 trillion debt is outrageous and this will just make it worst. You will just send those people and companies overseas.

#####
YANG!  Not Young, lady.
#####
Biden needs to drop out of the race and give Andrew yang a shot . That is if Democrats want to gain back some of the voters they lost who went to the trump camp. I voted for trump because of the idea of America first but yang is actually adding a monetary value to this idea and I would vote for him any day of the week over trump .
#####
Meghan is such an angry, bitter woman. She acts like she is so abused and mistreated al the time. But whenever she does speak it's so negative and closed minded. Everything she says is exactly the opposite of what I believe is important. But she is unprofessional i am sure conservatives must feel she gives them a bad name. And she tries SO hard, saying things like, "Well, where I grew up we defined happiness with chickens and shot guns" or whatver she said. She babbles.

Had to do a big time search for every video on Yang to understand all the details. We are in a learning curve when it comes to how Yang got to where he is in his convictions.

That redhead boomer is a dickhead

The voices that are saying Americans in general are stupid are coming from America , not from any other country . I have watched a few over the years so look into that and change the title maybe ?
#####
I laughed in tears when the moderators argued with each other, while Andrew Yang acted as grown up to quiet their fight by logic and reasoning.üòÇü§£
#####
Behar said by giving a $1000/ to every American 18 + & above is like giving a man a fish instead of giving him a line with which he can actually catch fish , for Behar who is earning really is high she can talk because she is not faced with the same problems every normal American is facing which is probably 70 to 80% of Americans . These families are working 2 and some 3 jobs just to make ends meet and if there would have been instead of 24  hours a day it is 36 hours then I am sure those same people would be working 4 to 5 jobs , slogging to make ends meet . In spite of working for so many hours they still face obstacles which can render them homeless if they were hit with one unfortunate accident etc. So really when these rich folks try to ridicule a person who is wholehearted in his efforts to make America actually be successful it is very unAmerican because they are being self centered and pretending to care only while they are on air . That‚Äôs what I see all the way here in Malaysia .

I‚Äôm so glad yang doesn‚Äôt ruthlessly attack trump and conservatives like the other Dems. He criticizes and shares his opinions based off facts and data. Some may disagree with him, but I think he can unify both parties and the American people.

A vote for Andrew is a real Yang for your bucks

I will vote for him as long as people on welfare dont get the 1000 dollars a month this is for the hard working poor responsible people to keep up with the irresponsible elite people who get handouts
#####
Yang is the truth get woke
#####
Less than 50% of eligible citizens have voted in the last five presidential elections. Keep an eye on voter registration numbers. I think Yang may be the person to make Americans break the 50% mark in voter registration and voting.

The guy is truly for the good of The States, but sadly he won't make it, his policy is against way too many rich dudes in charge, even challenging the DS. Everyone who some how managed doing that in the nation ends up assassinated.

Make this guy the next president come on bruh!

Yang is a smart guy. He makes sense.
#####
I've never paid attention to politics until i heard about Andrew Yang. Money has never been an issue but for many i know and have helped it's been a stuggle. So far i've watched many videos and if i could vote (fed felony, can't) i would vote for Yang.

I cant believe people are still saying, "Im undecided. None of the candidates make any sense." Argh. Haha. Im dying inside. My poor soul losing faith in my American people. My little soul is crying out loud, "Andrew Yang makes sense. How can you say no one makes sense?! Have you not been paying attention at all?" People watch too many tv ads and commercials. They listen too much to the fake media. I'm scared of what this country will become in the future. Stop saying America is not ready for Andrew Yang! When will we be ready?! When our country fails to the bottom???? This is why we are so behind other countries!!!! If we are not ready for change then we will NEVER be ready for anything positive.

If Yang is elected president:
1 He may be the smartest American president in history because he has a Chinese brain. But this will be a disaster for China.
2 He will make the United States split more seriously. Americans are born racists. After Obama's election, blacks have become more arrogant. After Yang's election, American Chinese will become more difficult to bully.
3 He will fall into the Chinesegate. (No doubt, I just received an order from the superior to bribe Yang by 10,000 tea eggs he has never eaten), which will lead to the deterioration of CN-US relations.
4 According to the historical law of ‚ÄúAlways Chinese hurts China the most seriously‚Äù, he will be the president most likely to lead the United States to declare war on China. Eisenhower chose to fight on the Korean Peninsula, and Yang is likely to choose Taiwan.
5 According to the above inference, the purpose of my bribery is to let him fail in the election, and my method is to tell the American public directly about bribing him.

I personally consider myself a right of center moderate with an open mind. Andrew Yang truly is a once in a generation type candidate! He‚Äôs authentic, genuine, and truly cares about helping the people in this country. He also offers exciting and creative policies like UBI. Trump definitely is divisive, but Andrew Yang is a unifier and a great leader that I would proudly support even if I don‚Äôt agree with everything he believes in. His campaign has been inclusive of everyone no matter where they are on the political spectrum. I have a lot of respect & admiration for Andrew. Best of luck & God bless!

This guy don't tell the truth. Unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in 40 or 50 years according to the labor department.     The country needs an award for the worker/employee/employer of $325.000 in a lump sum after 120 months on the job, military service included. Vocational school, high school, and college personnel will receive $55 per semester, as long as they get a C average or better in the class.  Contact your Tea Party or Natural Law Party Congressman for an exceptional bill in Congress.  What validates the printing and issuance of money is any legitimate labor and production, for payroll purposes.
#####
What Americans should like about Andrew Yang‚Äôs plans for UBI.  The first is the homeless epidemic in our country. With Andrew's UBI, every homeless person over eighteen would be given the ability to rent a place to live resulting in homelessness being over for those adults who use it productively solving a problem this country has struggled with for decades.  This would save millions in resources allowing current available resources to be focused on homeless youth.  This, along with the number of kids that are over eighteen still living with parents that can finally afford to move out, would also result in empty properties in every city being renovated, remodeled and rented as well as new home construction creating thousands of jobs in the real estate, construction and home supply industries.  As well, his plan would dramatically decrease the current number of evictions for renters across America.   The UBI can also be used in multiple ways as a crime deterrent.  For example, if the plan makes it law that anyone convicted of a felony after this becomes policy will be disqualified from receiving the UBI.  Or any person convicted of a crime in the entire country pay an additional tax that would be directly credited to the UBI program.  As well, UBI would provide a desperately needed decrease in the constant stress on our law enforcement, court and prison systems.  Most people would think twice before robbing a store or another person for few hundred dollars if it is going to cost them 12,000.00 dollars a year and 120,000.00 over the next ten years.  Used productively, UBI can not only gives people a reason not to commit a crime, but as well it can eliminate many of the desperate situations that fuel the desire to commit these crimes in the first place.  Another huge problem we have struggled with for decades that this plan would have a huge reduction in is domestic violence.  The UBI would enable thousands of women to get out of abusive relationships that they are currently in because they do not have the resources to leave.  It is a fact, that a large percentage of incidents involving everything from verbal abuse, physical abuse & divorce begin with financial stress.  UBI will almost instantly resolve many of these issues for thousands of households resulting in a dramatic decrease in domestic violence almost overnight saving law enforcement agencies across the country thousands of man hours every night and day.  Another huge problem our country has had for decades that UBI would almost eliminate overnight is child hunger.  No parent or guardian would have an excuse for not providing food to their children receiving the UBI.  The next thing UBI would help is single mothers / fathers and daycare / childcare.  UBI would allow thousands of single parents to pay for childcare that will allow them to find a job provide for their families.  This would also result in a huge increase in jobs in the daycare / childcare industry.  Another thing I want to mention is the auto industry.  UBI would enable thousands or millions to acquire transportation needed to find a job.  This will explode the number of jobs in the auto manufacturing, financing, sales, repair, transport and insurance industries.  Every job created by Andrew‚Äôs plan will be another taxpayer paying taxes.  With that said, I ask anyone looking at the candidates running for President to acknowledge these few facts all humans should be smart enough to know.  NO LIVING THING on this earth from a blade of grass to the President had any choice nor can they change what color they were born, where they were born, who created them, when they were born and in a human‚Äôs case, what they were taught when they were young.  To hate a person only for the color of their skin is hating someone for something they had nothing to do with, no control of and can not change.  NO LIVING THING filled out an application for birth.  With each, and every candidate running for President, please, listen to their words and plans, but ignore their skin color.

Watch some long form interviews with Andrew Yang. They are very good. The one he did with Joe Rogan 6 months ago is how I heard more about him than he giving people free money. His interview with Ben Shapiro was really good as well. Despite what anyone may think of some of the shit he has said, Shapiro was not saying super wild or disrespectful shit to Yang at all, and I really enjoyed the interview more than I thought I was going to. I listened to his one with Rogan as soon as Rogan put it on itunes. Don't sleep on the Sunday Special Shapiro one though, no matter what you think of Shapiro. His H3 podcast interview was also very good. The H3 podcast interview asked him details about things I hadn't heard anyone else I mentioned earlier ask him. Long form interviews with the right people are totally the way to go. Any candidate not doing them is only doing themselves a disservice.

Can't vote for a man who starts a speech by blaspheming the Holy Ghost. What are his morals? Does he support sexual deviance?

UBI is really a Universal Business Income.

Business owners have the most to gain from Yangs plan.
#####
An estimated 45.3% of American households ‚Äî roughly 77.5 million ‚Äî will pay no federal individual income tax.¬† ZERO

On average, those in the bottom 40% of the income spectrum end up getting money - refunds - FROM the government. 

WHAT EXACTLY MAKES THEM A SHAREHOLDER IN AMERICA?

THEY ARE NET TAKERS!

Meanwhile, the richest 20% of Americans, by far, pay the most in income taxes, forking over nearly 87% of all the income tax collected by Uncle Sam.

Your freedom dividend will not bring freedom to those forced to pay for it.
#####
There is everyone else, and then there is YANG.
He will go down in political history as a phenomenon.  I think he will overtake all the other presidential contenders as the man to beat.  News media that have been laughing him off as a political nobody will soon be beating a path to his door.  A true American success story.  And the best part is that Trump will be humiliated as a one-term president that will stick with him until the day he dies.  But we should all be watching out for all-out Russian interference from now through 2020.
#####
Better life, no devision, make America moving foward together, you name it, Vote Andrew for our next president.
#####
If the yang-haters and the rich people don't want the freedom dividend, they can either decline it or donate it to cancer research, homeless shelters, orphanages, etc... Imagine the results from that
#####
Every time he does a new speech, the crowd seems more engaged and his presentation gets smoother.  He's going to be selling out stadiums with his set pretty soon.
#####
Never, in the field of politics, has someone made so much sense in such a short time.

‚ÄúAmazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,‚Äù said an Amazon spokeswoman, Jodi Seth, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe have invested more than $160 billion in the U.S. since 2011, building a network of more than 125 fulfillment and sortation centers, air hubs and delivery stations as well as cloud-computing infrastructure and wind and solar farms.‚Äù

#####
Still blaming Amazon for the choices that American shoppers have made?

Americans should realize that they are the reason for the shops going out of business, not Amazon.

They placed the orders with Amazon from the comfort of their own homes rather than drive down town and spend their money in the local economy.

They are the main reason that the shops closed and now their children have no place to work over the summer.

There is no one to blame but the citizenry of the United States.

But demoncrats do love victims.

Yang will
not be President in 2020 since he will not get the senior vote primarily
because his UBI seems to discriminate against seniors in the respect that
workers receive wages and when opted-in will receive the UBI added to their
wages. In contrast seniors receiving Social Security, the majority cannot
opt-in since benefits are more than the UBI. It seems discriminatory since
seniors should be able to opt-in, get the UBI, and keep their benefits which
are much lower than wages even minimum wage in comparison. Therefore, it seems
doubtful Yang will get the millions of votes which seniors represent‚Ä¶..

That is the issue. People wait until there is a big issue to try to solve it after the fact when millions of people are affected and there is no chance to recover. Andrew sees the issues ahead and wants to be the Leader to start working on solutions before millions are affected. I am all for prevention. We need to wake up. Malls are really shutting down and I barely get a human on the phone anymore. So what is happening to those poor people losing their jobs? Those who live confortable now and are set financially don't worry about it, but for millions who are trying to make ends meet is very difficult. It is time for us the people to rise above this horrible dehumanizing life created by the 1%

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
The problem with this guy, is that he looks at things the same way as a lot of the other people. The data that's collected on unemployment doesn't include homeless people. It only collects those who willfully apply as unemployed. So, if you take that into consideration. Unemployment data would actually be much much higher. That's how they get away with saying unemployment "Is that an all-time low". It really isn't. Because if you look at homelessness, it's continuously growing.
#####
AI to our current economic system is cancer to our current biophysical system. The earlier you diagnose it, the better you can servive. I think Kaifu should understand this.
#####
For his entire career, Kaifu has never trained a job loser on new AI era skills. He had not even invested in any technology that helps a truck driver or factory worker to obtain such skills. The problem is not retraining.
#####
Its NOT Left, Its NOT right, Its FORWARD!!
#####
That's why he needs to push this through...and being President is the best option on the table, NOT that Andrew fantasizes about becoming President.
#####
What is needed is for more folks to venture out as entreprenurs...we are going to need more of them in the coming years....As Andrew Yang mentioned, its like pouring water in a tub with a hugh hole in it....
#####
That is what Yang intend to do...and frankly, the freight train is already at the doorstep and no one noticed that the elephant is already in the room....
#####
You need to lay the foundation before the freight train arrives or you will have a train wreck...
#####
Actual success figures for government sponsored re-training programmes 4 mfg workers who lost their jobs is between 0-15%...
#####
Employment figures are NOT reflective of the real figures.
#####
Unemployment numbers do not include the people who doesn't look for work in the calculations, that numbers are much more than people thought.
#####
This little guy doesn't have any idea what he's talking about. It's already happening, I'm experiencing it first hand. Because of technology ( not just AI per se) I can easily outsource job to other countries for people with much higher qualifications, skills and educational background for a more reasonable cost.!!!
Even if I wanted to hire people locally, there's none. And I'm force to do it to satisfy government requirements and regulations. Otherwise the business folds.
#####
It's wise to get ahead of the game,  don't wait til shit happens. Besides, the financial divide is so great,  UBI would alleviate that. So it's not just AI automation problem but also the great financial divide he's trying to alleviate.
#####
I disagree with the future Andrew Yang envisions for Americans..
#####
Register as a DEMOCRAT so you can vote in the PRIMARIES for ANDREW YANG.
#####
As Andrew Yang points out, I also believe the risk of waiting is too high.  Not just for those people to adjust/retrain etc (esp older people), if we consider how congress may respond to the changes (as we saw in FB/ Social media hearing), the exponential change of AI/Automaton/DIgital transformation is very hard to digest and difficult to respond.  In fact, we already see many signs of already being late, eg., look at increase in the number of people with psychological disorder, suicide, homeless, and drug overuse.  Also, look at how media is jumping all over in what I feel like a random manner.  Just looking around, we may agree that many of us are more confused - and possibly losing ability to assess what is actually going on - not to mention the direction of our society.   Accordingly, just looking at the top-line numbers on GNP or stock market (DJI/S&P) or unemployment rate does not tell us the story.  The unemployment number is just one measure (of employable people as a base) and that those displaced workers, those already given up employment (homeless) or calling themselves as handicapped/sick may need to be accounted to evaluate the situation more accurately.  As Andrew Yang had discovered by traveling all around various cities to do his work, living in silicon valley or NYC may not help us to understand the depth of the problems we face right now.  Bottomline:  Andrew Yang should be ahead of his movement than being late!

As Andrew says, what good is low unemployment number when you don't consider the participation rate....what is the success rate of retraining programs?....15 % max!....AI may create more jobs, but in high tech...how are you gonna retrain a 49 years old truck driver now deprived of a say 60k a year job, however punishing, to do high tech, so called nonroutine jobs...suggest that to a truck driver who just lost his lively hood and man hood to automation, and He Will Punch You in da Face!
#####
Mr Lee......you need to think harder. Your thinking is confined to the old paradigm.
#####
Mr. Lee's ideas are good for China, Andrew's ideas are good for the United States.

I don't agree with Mr. Lee entirely. First of all, there is no job that can last a lifetime, as technology becomes more advanced. People can be retrained again and again to adapt to the new environment, but as a person gets older, his/her ability to learn becomes lower and lower. Second, corporations generally don't hire older people, particularly those middle-aged people who have just been retrained. The idea of retraining is unrealistic. What I think is realistic and sustainable is for people to explore the new opportunity that would suit their strengths and interest. And this new opportunity may be a new job category that we have never seen before. And I think Andrew's UBI initiative would definitely contribute to this area.
#####
Mr. Lee is right about Andrew Yang being ahead of his time, but it is NOT a criticism. What Mr. Lee's politeness prevented him from saying is that we, Americans, are used to doing things first, and then thinking about consequences, unintended consequences, and unexpected results. Therefore, when A.I. stares us in the eye (go to Home Depot, Ralph's supermarket ,  airports, banks etc), but unemployment is not disastrously low, we don't get what a visionary  like  Andrew Yang  is telling us. I believe, however that we, the YangGang, DO understand his message very clearly.
#####
Yang supports UBI AND Open borders. Unemployment is at 3.5%. Yang is irrelevant. Anyone who supports him is literally exchanging their vote for cash.
#####
Kai Fu Lee get out from my face now, if you don't want me to kick your ass.
#####
True that Yang is ahead of his time.  Maybe by 10 years. Even further ahead of his time was Al Gore, by at least 40 years.
#####
Sadly I believe he is right Andrew Yang might be ahead of our time. Generally people are not very proactive, we wait until a crisis occur before we act. I hope this time around we'll vote someone into presidency to prevent a coming crisis rather wait for it to do something.
#####
If govt doesn‚Äôt know how to retrain, then give people a lifesaver (UBI) and let human creativity do the work of figuring it out.

Properly designed, all the cool new toys that AI is likely to bring should spark a renaissance of awesome new inventions and ideas that we cannot even begin to imagine yet and governments are often the WORST at shepherding such endeavors.
#####
I would say that Yang is not ahead of his time, rather the time has come/is ripe for somebody like him to be prez

#yanggang
#####
I don't think we want to see the economy crash from people loosing their jobs and then try to figure out what to do. Lets get ahead of the curve while we have a chance.
#####
Well he's Asian, so of course he's ahead of his time.  We're fucking smart.
#####
This guy does not know what he is talking about
#####
Flood US millennials with Sublime Asian food.
Go Yang!
#####
Andrew Yang has a plan to end poverty in America.  I have had people say to me that we will never end poverty.  Andrew Yang is like the Elon Musk of politics.  He is a renown problem solver.  He is refreshingly smart.  Andrew Yang likes math.  Elon Musk supports him.  Elon Musk understands we will need UBI.  You know Andrew Yang is good at math because he's Asian.  Here is Andrew Yang reading from his book "The War On Normal People."     https://youtu.be/GDT7XWCgOqQ
#####
He's an idiot trying to institute already tried and failed policies
#####
Retraining simple task workers to high tech jobs is unrealistic.
#####
What's a non routine job?
#####
well he doesn't know too much about yang because yang says "retraining programs have a zero to 15% success rate" so this dude's solution wouldn't work. The numbers don't say so.
#####
Retrained to do what? What are the jobs that will last a lifetime?
#####
Retraining needs cooperation people won‚Äôt cooperate like why happened in 1920 farming, what happened in coal miners, and will happen again. It‚Äôs just the same method that has not shown any success
#####
So now it's more important  than ever, those  who have jobs already can use that extra money to themselves
#####
Retraining will not work for this upcoming revolution. That is the main difference between this one and other previously.
#####
Don't agree with Lee on UBI... he's like the rest of backward thinkers.
#####
People do not want to get retrained. Retraining is the dumbest rich billionaire idea peddled to sheep who will believe it. Retraining is a joke and many people DONT WANT TO CODE OR DO TECH GARBAGE.
#####
What job will last a lifetime? And why is the burden of retraining so glibly foisted onto 30, 40, 50, 60 year olds? Many of whom have no savings and no way to retire. Retraining is not the answer. You might shut people up but their suffering continues. Didn‚Äôt somebody say disdain and neglect spurred people to vote for Trump, and keep them committed to him today, despite his failure to help them?
#####
Yang looks to the future not bogged down by the present
#####
Mr. Lee failed to understand Yang‚Äôs real purpose of ubi advocacy: buy votes through freedom dividends double talk mixed with automation fear mongering.
#####
There won't be a coding job for every truck driving, call center and retail clerk job replaced. It's not a one to one equation. One coder is going to replace several jobs. Retraining 3.5 million truck drivers for 200,000 coding jobs is not the solution.
#####
You can tell they haven't actually looked up the data or listened to single talk with Yang or they wouldn't be talking about retraining everyone like it's actually possible. Lazy media, do some prep next time pleaase, unsubing.
#####
You can't retrain a 40 y old truck drivers. Perhaps you can some but most will just snap without a job
#####
Andrew Yang said UBI is ‚Äúcapitalism that does not start with zero.‚Äù I think he is making a strong 
‚Äústatistics‚Äù sense. For the sake of simplicity, think of using linear regression to fit human welfare, y, which = m*x+b. The bias, ‚Äúb‚Äù, has been negligible so far and the ‚Äúm‚Äù (slope) seems to have grown bigger over time. We need a new ‚Äúb‚Äù (which is positive and somewhat significant) to fit welfare better. In other words, the ‚Äúregressor‚Äù (capitalism) needs some tweaking. A UBI of $1k/mo (the new ‚Äúb‚Äù) may be just the right number to get started for the US.
#####
He says Andrew Yang is too soon because the unemployment numbers aren't impacted yet. That's a terrible philosophy. Once jobs are impacted it will be too late. If you listen to what Yang is saying, the UBI is to soften the impact we'll face in the wake of the economic revolution. These things take time and effort to get in place and if we wait until everyone is jobless  it will be another few years before any move is made by government.
#####
I just came back from Japan and they are already ahead of us in the automation front. Seriously a lot of people who work in fast food and reception need to be on the look out. I foresee a serious increase in sex workers in the US in the next 10 years.
#####
Absolutely wrong. We as a society need to focus less on every single person being employed. If you have school aged children, you understand that it takes a village - often times many volunteer their time and energy with no contribution to the GDP to guide youth in our nation. Unconditional UBI will help support our communities in more impactful ways to support these types of people who are providing a valuable service in lieu of using their personal time to be at a job
#####
First you have to get money in
People's hands that will automatically 
Boost  the economy and create jobs.
We will eventually have to change 
how we view work.and then try to
figure out what it means to be
human.
#####
Nope he's right on time!!
#####
What's with this bs we don't know how!?!?  Dude kill yourself
#####
Chinese work ethics vs American work ethics government wise and culturally wise are very different. The goals are the same between the two, however the sacrifices are too harsh for Americans. Americans want a good balance between family and work. Just watch ‚ÄúAmerican Factory‚Äù on Netflix and you‚Äôll get an idea. Aslong as the Chinese in China are willing to sacrifice so much for so little in return, jobs in America will look to AI and automation to try and compete with China.
#####
The platform is premature by about one generation because the technocracy that elects a technocrat must be educated enough to agree with the message. I see free elections in China in the near future and the election of the first technocrats will begin there not here in the Americas.
#####
I disagree with Mr. Lee. There was an article written about how the unemployment numbers were actually higher than reported. Some 500,000+ due to an error.
#####
This is the issue, older people are stuck in the mentality that humans should have a job their entire life, that's slave mentality, we need to have an income and be creative and create Values to society. When WWW.YANG2020.COM is president and he starts the Freedom Dividend and puts the money into our own hands so we can decide what we want or need to do with it, that will add local jobs because people will spend money in their local communities, it will spurn Entrapanureship, and that community will flourish. ReTraining people isn't really an option because the only thing to retrain into would be Coding and computer science, and your talking people in their 40's who've lived their lives without a degree and that's just overwhelming for them, not to mention the elderly still working I to their 60's. Andrew Yang is right to get this started now, cause Automation of everything possible is the future, we weren't meant to work our lives away, we were meant to enjoy life, automation is going to force that reality on us all. As time moves on and less and less work is available, tech companies will make more and more money, so our freedom dividend will go up and if we pay off our National Debt that money will be worth more and go longer. As a nation we bring in $20 trillion dollars a year, our national budget is $4 trillion, so we have $16 trillion left over to use towards paying off our debt and to pay into real needed things. The Freedom Dividend will be paid for with the Added Value Tax on companies who've automated. We can't wait years more we need to do this now and get ahead of what's coming, we love "The Avengers" but we need to be "The Preventors" about A.I. and Automation.
#####
Yang is right about the scope of the problem being too big for conventional tactics not to result in mass tragedy. Unacceptable tragedy.
#####
Andrew Yang is not ahead of his time, Andrew Yang is *the man we need right now.* #yanggang2020
#####
But doesn‚Äôt retraining not work very well.  And if it did it takes a lot of time.  The freedom dividend is meant to just help with the transition, it‚Äôs not mean for people to live a full happy life with it
#####
With the protests to outlaw self driving trucks 4 days ago at Capitol hill I think hes on time.

The legion of builders and destroyers is a retraining program in a sense.

And call center workers as well as truckers also will gain a transition financial break under Yang. 

Honestly I think if Trump were reelected he would push to outlaw automation in general and China would take the lead in technology.  

Disclaimer: I'm voting for Andrew yang in the primaries and in the general so I do have a bias even if based in reason.
#####
Google ‚ÄúYouTube Joe Rogan Andrew Yang.‚Äù
#####
Yang is an incredible moron! If there is that much money than there is zero excuse to ever cut Social Security a dime ever!  Let the free loader earn theirs like those before them. All this idiot would do is inflate the shit out of our money and destroy those that already earned their Social Security ! As the idiot didn't think to include them. Remember Democrats stole the social security  money to fund their Vietnam war!  There are plenty of unfunded liabilities . Without starting a free bee give away for those that didn't earn it!  Yang is an idiot!
#####
UBI enables re-training to be self-directed and market driven.  People can select which training programs to enroll in and pay for the training with the Freedom Dividend.  Others can use the Freedom Dividend to start small businesses to offer training that is appropriate to demand. 
Government driven re-training is a very bad idea and a waste of tax dollars
#####
Who came looking for an andrew yang interview they haven't seen before?



I know I did üñêüèæ
#####
Unemployment is low because only 63% of able Americans are actually working.  Many who have lost their jobs to automation have given up and left the work force.
#####
I have a feeling Andrew Yang could potentially be a Chinese spy, i mean China right now is trying to do whatever it takes to take over the world and be #1 by stealing, cheating, copying, spying, lying, manipulating, coercing, etc. to get to the top. They even say it them selves its called "Made in China 2025" im not kidding lol
#####
Yang has already addressed and debunked these concerns.  Retraining doesn‚Äôt work.  Unemployment numbers don‚Äôt count people who have dropped out of the workforce permanently.  Labor participation rate is more applicable.
#####
AI (computer) just increases efficiency. In human history, we are always improve efficiency. For example, Tractor harvester invention make farming more efficient.  Today, the average U.S. farmer feeds 155 people. In 1960, a farmer fed just 26 people. In 1960, the unemployment rate is 6.6%, in 2018, the unemployment rate is 4.0%. Increasing productive did not increase unemployment. Andrew Yang is wrong.
#####
You know what I love about Andrew Yang and the people who support him?  There isn't any nastiness.  It's a discussion of issues and possible solutions without any of the posturing.  It is so refreshing.
#####
Yang's is running at the perfect time, it's just that America is so laughably behind.
#####
Even retraining works well (although the data say otherwise), you should not anticipate a driver to become a programmer overnight. Families need food on table. The people need a soft landing during the massive job displacement. Without UBI, we will see massive riots according to history, the new chaos will only be bigger if you compare the differences between driver jobs and programmer jobs. Before the society is ready, UBI can buy us time and save humanity.
#####
Training seems like a great ideal, or a database of ideals where people can submit there Ideals.
#####
How much training is needed ? only jobs that automation cannot replace... mechanics, HVAC techs, plumbers , electricians , carpenters , other than that , the rest are easy , general maintenance, labors, retail, salesmen , are all on the job training...or you can use that 1k a month while you attempt to start your own business, write a book, volunteer in your neighborhood , meals on wheels , etc... it would be a game changer , no matter what the nay sayers claim..
#####
At least we are fully aware that the Freedom Dividend is only the first step towards reshaping our economy
#####
I love hearing Andrew Yang being discussed by intelligent individuals in long form media. Even if they don't agree exactly with what I believe in, I appreciate that they are willing to look at his ideas objectively and give criticism. Anyone can give criticism, it's the strong and resilient who can take it. I believe President Yang will be the biggest leap forward this country has seen for 75 years, and I would know I'm 27 ü§£
#####
Yet, no one can say what people will need to be trained in. This wait and see approach to displacement is the same attitude we‚Äôve had for to long. Anytime a recessions hit were always unprepared, shocked, etc 

Once the jobs go and the system can‚Äôt replace them with something else at a fast pace we will see violence, chaos, a revolution that might destroy what we call home. 

Yang is trying to get way out front of it, start transforming the economy now, hard choices need to be made bow not then. I can‚Äôt stand these individuals who state the problem but have no real answer.. 

We are at a point where wealth is so concentrated at the top .. it needs to be leveled to bring on the greater balance .. then we can grow into the next phase of our economic system.. where people are valued for their daily contributions to society that aren‚Äôt measured or consider a job..
#####
How bout no routine jobs.
#####
Big-government Communism? Ahead of its time? Let's hope not.
#####
Retrained don't work budy peoples got bills to pay and the percentage for successful retraining programs for peoples are low. You are behind of your time Mr. Lee.
#####

I have a Dream..
#####
Very good platform.  There's 327.2 million people in United States and that includes children, so giving $1,000 a month to every American Adult (ages 18 years old and up) then that is very possible 'coz there's probably only "half" of the 327.2 million population who are adults in this country, so that would not cost a trillion dollars to give away, and for a total of one year that would be a big help to every household, so no need of tax refund anymore for the average working adults as well as food stamps for the low income people.
#####
Awesome candidate, hope Americans make him their president.

I love how much he avoids being divisive

Andrew yang's comment about Israel was very disappointing he needs to better educate himself on this critical issues or seek advice from advisors/confidante in foreign policy before he losses his ever - increasing supports.

He has the policies but he needs to learn to be a politician and fast.He got outspoken by Eric,Marianne,Gilibrand etc.People need vigor to accept ideas.He keeps saying the same thing over and over which is good for people‚Äôs memory.He needs to be a bully at the next debate,interrupt some of those wackjobs.Dont be so polite Mr Yang.If you want to win,play the winners game.Get off the sidelines and fight for your speaking time to express your ideas

Typical repub argument(Hypocrisy)... when the younger blonde said dems spend too much- YEAH, the REPUBS blow up our debt by giving billionaires tax cuts, but dems stick to budget & only spend where it‚Äôs reasonable like giving a UBI to citizens instead of only $ to the wealthy. Repubs blow $ on July 4 parades, Dems spend $ helping poor people & average people get out of poverty- BIG DIFFERENCE... it‚Äôs an oligarchy that needs change now or this country will be in dictatorship soon.
#####
- I WISH he would have said, (when she said our debt is TOO HIGH) to say YES  DEBT is high so REPUBS SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HUGE TAX BREAKS RECENTLY TO BILLIONAIRES, exactly! 
He better learn to stand up to these repub idiotic non logical arguments fast ! Bernie has it down. Cmon Yang dear! Step up your game babe!!!! NOW or NEVER! ;-)

He seems like a great guy, but pledging to give every American $1000 is a monumentally stupid waste of money.
#####
I cried when she called him Andrew "Young"
#####
I love that he doesn't waffle around the questions like literally ALL other politicians (except for Bernie, mostly). He just...answers the questions. Imagine! A completely honest and down to earth guy in the White House!

Off topic but SUNNY LOOKIN SNATCHED, yesss bad bihhhhhü§™

Yang did so good in this interview. And to the credit of the view they weren‚Äôt bad either this time.

They better not ghost him in the upcoming debate like they did last time. CNN you can do better than MSNBC!

ANDREW YANG IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE PROPOSING SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE REAL CHANGE FOR THE EVERYDAY AMERICAN.  EVERYONE ELSE JUST PROPOSES THE SAME SMOKE&MIRROR BS THEY ALWAYS GIVE US #YANGGANG

Thank you to ABC and the producers for having Andrew on the show! Please invite him back and talk about some of the other policies that he has that will help women, like forgiving student debt and free preschool! I feel like your audience deserves to hear from him more.
#####
Why weren‚Äôt they this pleasant to Marianne.  Just saying.
#####
Republicans did make this countries debt!

Andrew does great!!!!
#####
He has no chance. But it's cute that he's trying.
#####
His solutions are forward-thinking and I have had so many friends across the entire spectrum come together like no other. 
Can we take a moment to notice how MEGAN MCCAIN HAD A GOOD INTERVIEW. She behaved and she asked fair (ish ish) questions. This is PROOF that the person for 2020 is Andrew Yang. I'm definitely voting for Andrew Yang.
#####
Although I don't see Yang getting through the primaries it is so so nice to see him being given time on the show to discuss his views. He has some really amazing ideas that are often overlooked because of his low poll numbers. Not to mention, as an Asian American it makes my heart feel very full to see an Asian man running for president.

You just keep getting better and better.

I discovered Yang by watching the debates a couple weeks ago. The way he answered his two questions led me to check out his website. This guy definitely has a ton of legit and practical solutions on there. I went to Beto's site too and found nothing.
#####
It seems he has some good policies. I rather him interview with these ladies than TYT
#####
For those who haven't done so, please check out Andrew's interview with Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro.
#####
If Meghan McCain has a close friend who is fully #YangGang, then you know he's getting many people who are conservative or Republicans to wake up to the real problems plaguing America and back his candidacy.
#####
It not about retraining but repurposing! Example: All these old abandoned factories repurpose them to build Solar Panels, Wind Turbines, Electrical Cell etc. The take ALL out of work auto workers who are used to assembly line Production and Manufacturing And give them a job in these factories! That's just one example!
#####
I like" MATH"!

I cant wait to vote for yang ! This will be my first time !!!! I was born here too lol !!!!!  in my 40's now !!!!!
#####
And if you vote for Yang you keep these skunks in power ( Dems) .
#####
Ok every store owner , landlord , restaurant owner ECT ECT ECT will know you now get 1000$ a month for free and are all rdy planning to separate you from it ??? And if you tax and do all these things he plans to do to these large company's will only triple the cost . so again it will fall right on the race payers
#####
Yeaaaaaa free stuff !!!
#####
Just had a long discussion with my Mom, telling her about his amazing policies, and she is totally Yang gang now! Never in history has She nor I been so supportive of any American candidate. Actually, I was a massive Bernie supporter last time, but I think Yang policies will actually bring both the left and right sides together.

While others come and make false promises and political HONEY POINTS just to get vote and usually it‚Äôs identity politics and ‚Äútrump is bad so choose us ‚Äú but don‚Äôt explain why ..... typical politicians !! Can‚Äôt be trusted at all
This guy speaks honestly , u can trust him , debate him , and be confident that in case of controversy he will actually listen to BOTH SIDES before making a decision .... GET HIM TO PRESIDENCY
#####

#####
He has a really good understanding of human psychology. He could just be fooling us all but honestly its the best shot we got atm.
#####
Honestly, I really really enjoy listening to him
#####
YANG 2020!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
So excited
#####
If you guys believe in manifestation. The principles of feeling things are true before they are reality is a huge catalyst in attracting things. Visualize this future he speaks of! Feel the love of finally putting morals over money not just in the US but in History!
#####
Lowkey i‚Äôd let Yang be my dictator
#####
Why is that so hard for people to understand Joe Biden is not the president for the people he is another po-lie-tician, politician.  Please young and old let‚Äôs get this man in the White House.
#####
Yang is the only one who can take Trump on properly. And I like Trump enough (would have voted for him in 2016 if I lived in USA)., but I want him to have a good challenger. If Yang wins I'm the most happy then.
#####
I prefer not going to my death when the oxygen is depleted due to global warming. The economy can wait.
#####
Every time I listen to Andrew Yang I feel like I'm listening to a great teacher/professor
#####
Homelessness resolution for Andrew yang.
#####
Create a rich business...   use technology... have yang rape your business and take your profits because you are a tech company.  If you are a top company like amazon he will make you loose money and go to 3rd place like myspace.   noone wants to help you or go to your American business anymore.  Yang Lies so much.   Watch his videos and go follow up on them.... he will remove your welfare so yo ucan get 1000... then in another video he says you can keep it but he will have to find where the money will come from.  He also has no plan to bring down the deficit.
#####
I will not be eligible to vote for yang in time of the 2020 election due to my age and it sucks
#####
Yang 2020 Let‚Äôs have it !!!! It‚Äôs time to pull together ‚ù§Ô∏è
#####
I like Andrew's idea, seems like a great guy and leader. I live overseas so it doesn't really impact me however I like to generate some discussions. People are generally born lazy and greedy, I can be too. My point about lazy if people get free money, some people may not take work as seriously, example half the doctors may quit their jobs, and services qualities may drop or be unavailable due to doctors number. The greedy point was kinda brought up a little, greedy landlords or businesses may charge more for a rent/burgers (cost of living will go up). Say u said u get a few friends to buy a property together, there is a risk of in house fights, n also what is there to stop other set of friends bidding for the same house, price will go up too. Cost of living will definitely go up and the ordinary people may still lose out. Don't get me wrong, I love free money however it is just how I see it. Any comments are welcome, ready to be corrected if I am missing something?
#####
Never thought I'd say this, but, thank you Fox for actually covering Yang. I'll be sure to check out your channels more frequently from now on. MSNBC is dead to me.
#####
Wow I wish I could vote for this guy. He is that awesome.
#####
what a freaken badass!!!!!
#####
Yang has my vote

Currently on an Andrew Yang binge.

I've watched about every interview I can find with Andrew Yang, and I'm afraid I'm starting to get my hopes up about a brighter future.

Obama - Facebook President
Trump - Twitter President
Yang - Youtube President
#####
Watching from Spain. Please vote in Yang. It's the first time I've felt hope again for the world. You guys can change the way the future and the present are with who you decide will lead. It affects the whole world. This is the only guy with an actual thought through plan. Not just in US politics but in what I see in our own and in Europe and internationally. He has a plan, it's not just empty lines or cliches the crowd wants to hear but spell no action.
#####
Oh no!!! Where's the rest??? Any links? Thanks xx
#####
Andrew Yang for President! Pete Buttigieg for VP!

Godammit! I just spent 50 minutes watching this it felt like 10!

Take the money out of politics and give it to the people... "FOR GOD'S SAKE WE'VE GOT TO GIVE MORE POWER TOO THE PEOPLE!"

It was the trickle down economy that made room for Bernie to smear the democrats with "socialism" that caused millions to die fighting against the rich in during the "Bolshevic Revolution" Trump is already blaming the democrats; but he likes sanders...You go figure!
#####
$1,000/month...NOW THAT'S PROVIDING FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE... WE DO NOT NEED "SOCIALISM" THE RED MEAT FOR TRUMP'S UNMOVABLE BASE!

Mr. Yang and Mr. ( The Rent Is Too Damn High ) Jimmy McMillan, for President and Vice President. We can bring crime down overnight!

35 minutes in and I've switched from Independent to Democrat  to vote Yang üëçüèª

Please win!!!

Unfortunately, the media (as a whole) won't cover him because he makes sense. They don't want him to get elected because Yang will fix a lot of suffering in America...
#####
If you and your spouse each received the Freedom Dividend, $1,000.00/month each, and you both saved that money for 3 years, you would accumulate  $72,000.  You put that money on a down payment on a house, got a 30 year fixed 6.0% interest rate loan, you will be able to own a $300,000 home/condo.
#####
The first time I heared he is an asian running for president, I thought he was crazy. Then I heard his 1000 dollar plan, I thought it was a joke. Then I clicked one of his interview video by accident, I could not stop listening and talking to my friends about him. It is not about the free money. It is because his plan will make the society better, and make people nicer.
#####
He will not win

I'm lovin his fresh .
NEW AND BRIGHT IDEAS  THAT I THINK  WILL BOOST THIS  ECONOMY  AND LOWER THE CRIME RATE AND HOMLESSNESS  BY  THE MILLIONS   WHEN PPL GOT MONEY  EVERY BODY IS  HAPPY I JUS THINK  HIS PLANS WILL WORK IM VOTING  FOR THIS MAN AND IM GONNA MAKE SURE I EXPLAIN TO ALL  MY FRIENDS  AND FAMILY  WHY I THINK  HE IS THE BEST CHOICE  FOR US MEANING  THE BLACK COMMUNITY  ...YANG GANG!üëåüèΩüí®üí®‚ô•Ô∏è

He would win by a landslide if he could get the companies he says would foot the bill to endorse him campaign.
#####
I actually work in robotic industry to replace workers and I am telling you this: every single words come from Andrew Yang's mouth is true. It is coming and it will be a longest winter in human history. If we pass this opportunity I will be very sad and do not know how to imagine my kids future.
#####
There is a high chance you are looking at the next American president.
#####
We need this guy to be president it is crucial to the survival of America
#####
As a conservative I too wonder why FOX rarely mentions Andrew Yank, he seems to have better scenes that any democratic candidate I've head thus far - maybe FOX is not as unbiased as I thought!  This guy is the real deal!
#####
Watch the last question..
I did not know that about the SAT..
Anyone running for president should be hugging more.

If you ain‚Äôt donating you need to vote. Take it from a 30yr old who never cared about anything until now

He pronounced data the British way :-)

Also of course fox likes yang now. They realized his UBI funding policy spoils the rich extra free monthly money off the backs of the poor losing money. Capitalism at work. Screwing over the poor as always to spoil everyone else free money. Go figure!

Yang's democrates only hope for real.
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

I am a trump supporter and I would consider voting for Andrew Yang for President in 2020.  I feel like he is someone we need to bring us into the future.  There needs to be a solution to automation.  He needs to show how he can handle foreign policy.  What is his stance on foreign policy issues we are facing now?  You won me over on economy and business!
#####
Is he a standup comedian.. I can listen to him whole day..  US citizens should elect him as a next president..
#####
29:30 Seriously the time he took to answer Greg‚Äôs first question knows that he wants people to learn about politics and not snake away from the questions just to make himself look better

He is exactly who Trup and Biden Izzn't!

This man's hilarious

This guy runs rings around all other candidates.

Andrew Yang 2020!

One of the only actual left-wing candidates in the DNC...
#####
Wow! Goes to Iowa and not one word about teaching sustainable development , about generational farms , about elderly , about veterans , racial Equality, affordable housing , homelessness assistance .... Nothing of substance! Sanders also has technology as important!
 I guess as long as we push technology we don't have to worry about lush fertile lands, restored forests and filling our aquifers as it continues to heat up ! Follow the Scientist's that we trust to care for our children, our Medicine, our lives every day!
Senator Sanders plan has just this advancements in technology that he knows we WILL NEED IN THE FUTURE and he CONTINUALLY VOTED for assisted living Caregiver Coverage and BENEFITS !! I wish these folks would , at least , read the plan's outlines ! No One is left behind!
#####
THIS is how the democrats run to loose! Dems are armed with the best 
candidate and they throw her away. Feminist are fake. Totally full of BS.
 Women and Feminist should be roaring behind her in her favor but they 
are silent or worse. Feminist and Democrats are either Fake or Stupid. 
Are you Blind or an enthusiast for failure?
#####
If you guys think the issues Andrew raise in his speech are unfounded or not an issue right now just know this. Here in SF, we have a coffee shop that takes your order from your phone and a robot makes and serve you coffee. There is a burger joint that makes burger from start to finish in less than 10 minutes with the minimal human intervention other than refilling the ingredients.Tesla has been test driving their trucks up and down the Bay Area all summer sometimes without a driver. Some restaurants has Ipads on every table so you can sit, order your food and a waiter will bring it out to you without you ever interacting with anyone. You can even pay using the ipad on the table. Now think about what these kind of technology can when they are everywhere.

I liked trump but I'm goin for yang gang
#####
"Educate and retrain ... for the jobs of the future..." -- if you take out 10 old skill jobs and replace them with 5 high skill tech jobs even successfully retraining 100% will leave 5 unemployed.  I'm not sure the real numbers, but I'm sure the lost jobs outnumber the new ones.  That response just does not work.
#####
Yang isn‚Äôt presidential material. His message is all wrong. First he hits you with the ‚Äúrobots are coming for your job‚Äù scare story. Jobs and industries are destroyed and created every day. In a word, it‚Äôs called productivity. The trucking industry will get more done with fewer workers. The displaced workers will find other jobs. Streaming put DVD makers out of business; those people now work at Netflix. The automobile made the horse and buggy obsolete. The iPhone put telephone operators out of work. So what‚Äôs his answer for technology innovation? Give you $1K per month? Yes it is a gimmick. What he doesn‚Äôt want to say is that we should increase taxes on the super rich and invest that money in public education, public health, a modernized energy grid and infrastructure. Those investments produce jobs. Then the idea about GDP. Seriously, does that excite anyone? Environmentalists have been talking about measuring economic activity differently for years because oil spills, for example, are counted positively since they require the government and private entities to spend more money. Yang might be a good advisor to a federal tech czar but he should end his vanity candidacy.
#####
I had the privilege to see this in person, and I have so say he was easily one of the best people speaking, and certainly the most engaging with the crowd.
#####
this man got visions. but extracting citizen  dividends from big crops need international corporation. it is not that simple I believe. but it is a way forward. and it is a way to solve inequality

THATS MY BOY 
YANG 2020

Three minutes of listening to Yang and I like this guy. He is talking completely different way then everyone else.

I like how he is explaining this stuff to people. I would be willing to to donate just to keep him talking like he is to America.

Amazon is paying ZERO tax?

Someone asks "How would a $1000 a month change somebody's life?!" . Apparently that person has never experienced poverty! A good example are the homeless. Most are not homeless because they want be. They are homeless because of circumstance. $1000 a month would shut down the homeless shelter INDUSTRY and empower everyone to help one another! Now I am aware that every politician is prone to tell a lie, but the numbers don't lie, and if you don't know them you can't tell them! My vote is for Yang until someone can come up with something more credible!
#####
He is about improving infrastructure, that alone is enough to vote him

Holy shit making sure I can vote in the primaries today.

Yang would make a good president - too bad he doesn't have an actual chance of winning. He is doing a valuable thing by running though, if his run can help to bring these ideas into the mainstream.I hope that once he ends his campaign, he'll endorse Bernie Sanders, and in my ideal scenario, you'd have a President Sanders, with Yang given an influential role in his government. And maybe, just maybe, a Yang presidency some time in the future.

lemme get this straight --- we tax the progressive billionaire democrat at Amazon so we can trickle it down........ so we can trickle it up?? 
just gimme my $12000 a year, Andy & spare me the bullsh&t.

AMAZON--- run by a big time progressive....pays no taxes.
hmmmmm...

Even Tucker Carlson knows that Yang talks sense!  C'mon, we're talkin' Tucker "anti-democrat" Carlson.  When you're speaking with someone intelligent and can 'feel' their humanity, it's hard to go on the attack.  Of course, Fox and Tucker are going to endorse Trump, but at least they recognize the intelligent, empathic man that Yang is.

Hey DMRegister... I just noticed that Andrew Yang videos on your channel has like the most views. Like 10 to 1 ratio. Is that normal?

Andrew is literally teaching and quizzing people as he campaigns. Rather than deflecting and ignoring the issues he is bringing them to the forefront.

The Freedom Dividend is the simplest, most effective policy that any candidate has. It's effectively a public budget and it helps solve almost every issue Democrats are trying to tackle. Student debt, education costs, healthcare costs, income inequality, empowering minorities, empowering women, the gender pay gap (lol), job losses from automation, small business formation, childhood education, and much more are all helped with more money. The policy is incredibly lightweight, too, since it doesn't have huge operational costs. It's not the perfect or last solution, but it absolutely is the biggest, simplest, and most forward thinking policy. It sounds like a gimmick, but once you break it down you see the immense value and efficiency.

Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
Like sure $1000 a month gets the attention, but you can‚Äôt deny that he doesn‚Äôt have some really solid ideas in many other areas, and seems quite competent on America as a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and how that affects all of us.
#####
Mark my words. Trump after winning the republican nomination he will self sabotage, after giving Andrew the oval office on a silver plate, he will have a speech about in order for Yang to exist, I the yin had to bring him out of his slumber.
#####
He‚Äôs clearly the Singularity cleverly designed and disguised by Elon Musk... Elon will reveal it one day, whilst smoking a doob with Joe Rogan.

Either than or I‚Äôm a jealous Brit who has realised we have no one near as exciting as this guy....
#####
Well, Andrew Yang has some real answers to the challenges we're facing, definitely the most interesting candidate out there, I mean, this guy is like Bernie but with 21st century solutions.
#####
I'm not a citizen, and will not get the $$$$, but he's actually giving each and American a OPPERTUNITY to be MILLIONAIRES. Here's a tip, if he's president, buy houses. This thing, the $$$$, imagine the homeless being able to afford RENT... THE POSSIBILITY IS ENDLESS..... OR KEEP TRUMP. Which I'm Kool with.
#####
Eyes on YANG and 3 other candidates.... HOWEVER Bernie is my first choice
#####
Yang looks better and better as a presidential candidate. Darkness (empty numbers) exist so tha stars (hearts) have a place to live. Not the other way around.

Accountants (empty numbers) exist so that poets, artists, musicians and mystics (stars) have a place to "be". Not the other way around.
#####
Sad that news stations don‚Äôt support you man! Keep up the good work

Hey, it's my buddy, Wang!
No offense.

`I do like Yang, but I can't take him seriously on matters concerning the economy until he demonstrates to me that he knows and believes in MMT (Modern Monetary Theory).

#####
Yang the uniter bringing the political divide together in Iowa
#####
While speaking at Democratic Forum in Des Moines, Iowa Yang broke down over gun violence.  Did Andrew Yang cry when former NYPD officer who shot an unarmed black man to death in a darkened stairwell was spared prison time when the judge reduced his manslaughter conviction to a lesser charge in a case that became a flashpoint for police accountability. Peter Liang was sentenced to five years' probation. Yang is a phony.  Has he ever broken down over the gun violence in Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, etc.  Person (s) like him make me want to throw up.  This guy want to give everybody $1000.  That includes Bill Gate, Warren Buffet, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, trust fund babies, rapist, murders, etc.  See how ridiculous that sounds.  This phony will never be president of the U.S..  Why vote for him when you already have a phony in the WH.  This guy is polling too low in the black communities to be even be considered a serious contender.  But the white media always act like black voters do not exist in the democratic primaries.  Good luck being the nominee without their support.
#####
Please people... you can go back to left vs right if you want... just let Yang fix the damn problems right now so we all don't perish.
#####
I love Presidential Candidates that sell t-shirts and baseball caps with the "Math" logo.....and try to cause excitement and great enthusiasm by promising monthly free cash handouts to the thrilled population ..... a candidate that has a huge number of more than 100+ policies and promises !!!!!, ...and countless supporters that call themselves "Gang".....those are very wise and rational facts to get elected as President of a country ...!

" The Irrationality of a thing is no argument against its existence, rather a condition of it " ... ( F. Nietzsche ).
#####
Yang is a corporatist!!!
#####
He is the future of USA! I wish he is the president of the world! He is not only super intelligent but also extremely wise as to how we solve the problems of our time and make better lives for all!
#####
How about cut my taxes by $5000 assholes? And you can keep the $1000 of my tax money.
#####
What a sham
#####
I liked his last speech where he said "And there isn't a lot of time left" in a panic and everyone went silent and he said we can't go through 4 more years of Amazon and the like takiong jobs away and the applause was insane. I think he needs more doom and gloom, it works.
#####
All stay-at-home moms should support Yang if you believe your work, or your life for that matter, isn't worth zero.
#####
#Yanggang2020 #MATH HUMANITY 1st!

Sorry Trump and mother Russia, I am hacking for Yang this time.

Excellent speech, let's get him to the White House and improve the country! #YangGang

This guy is amazing. Although the US system got someone like Trump to become President, it no doubt is still resilient and refreshing.

Last 2 minute was the greatest content

"Where is my music? I was kidding there is no music." :D

the media is trying to downplay yangs following because his UBI policy hurts the 1%ers that own those media sites. also mind you amazon bought a news outlet last year. the views compared to the other candidates speak for themselves.

Yang 2020
#####
Yang makes a credible and convincing argument for Univeral Basic Income. I admit I am intrigued. But I still believe it's too radical and will eventually cause economic bankruptcy. That said, I would be open to the idea of implementing UBI in a tightly controlled sub-population within the USA. For example, We have 50 states. Why couldn't one state volunteer to be the "guinea pig" for this social experiment-- Iowa, for example? Kind of like legalizing marijuana in a state and observing the outcome. If UBI achieves its objectives for its citizens after a period of say 5 years, then we can roll it out across more states. But if it fails-- for example, it causes mass migration of illegal aliens from one part of the country to another, and leads to lower economic productivity and financial insolvency-- then the state can cancel the program, ASAP,  to minimize  the damage and America as a whole will have averted economic disaster. Meanwhile, the rest of America can then bear witness to the results and decide whether or not Yang was right all along. Either way, I wish Yang all the best as he seems to be the only solutions-oriented candidate for President.
#####
What would people spend the UBI on? Whatever they want including drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, opioids, guns......Again whatever they want.

Robot trucks aren't coming any time soon. Automation in factories thus far has largely replaced repetitive jobs, not ones that require a lot of decision making. If anything, automated truck driving will be more like autopilot assisting drivers rather than replacing them.

Remember people, in order to support him when he makes it to the primaries which im sure he will, you may have to either register or fill out forms to vote democratic. But dont let that stop you and you could always reverse that. The support matters. Its not left or right, its forward

I wish yang would be less politiciany and stick to being a normal person. He's saying the same canned jokes and catch phrases all the time. Not hating but this is not the way to win votes.

Yang has real quick-impact microeconomic solutions that will work to lift each household, each state and the country. His other policies are sound and logical. Tax policy adjustments aside, all other candidates have policies that are too macro and with very broad-based with a slow-burn impact on the economy. It takes MATH to see it for what it is. But does he have the gusto to beat Trump in 2020? That's the real question #yanggang @Yang2020

I feel like the people who dont like yang still use Internet explorer...

WoW, He was able to Captivate my Entire Family's Attention Span for the entire time. Real Solutions to Real Problems. His message addressed all of our Concerns with Great Substance. Thanks for this Video.
#####
Does this moderator has a specific candidate she‚Äôs supporting resulting in such demeaning attitude and unprofessional behavior hosting this forum? What a shame.
#####
The top 1% is reaping $$$ from the broken incarcerations system and that needs to go. It‚Äôs a tragedy the rich is disabling the common wealth.
#####
I'm happy for American if UBI can be a reality ,because 98% need it for your life,I believe no one will be left out.Only this guy could Care For You.Good Luck.Greeting from Malaysia.
#####
I'm 38 years old and I never voted. My model is "why vote, just cope" but I will make an exception this time around because Yang is giving me Hope that I'm scare of.
#####
man no wonder the media is doing #yangmediablackout ...he bluntly wants to support competition against big media.
#####
appreciate him actually answering the inflation question using elasticity after trying to evade it and seeing it didn't fly with academics.
#####
even if he has trouble getting UBI to pass, he is the most fit to be our next president
#####
I mean, hes talking about moves that can reshape the country, because I believe the US has been shaped by and under the rule of white supremacist christians, I think anything Yang does will bring us closer to all the cool shit.
#####
Ive been looked at like a madman while I preached for our rights to intellectual and personal property for years. Yang just stole my vote from Bernie.
#####
CAN YOU USE EXTRA MONEY ?,YES I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE REPLY .

Andrew Yang is a gift to America.
#####
The lady standing with Andrew wanted Andrew to make such a foolish statement upfront about reducing the incarceration by 50%. And then she further insisted when Andrew was thinking how best to answer that 12 other candidates had agreed to it. Looks like there's 12 candidates who make promises they're unsure they can make, or at least should make. Of course andrew believes that there is way too much profit motivated incarceration and anyone aware would want to reduce that. But upfront making a 50% promise is pure foolishness, there are so many factors to look at, and the lady was pushing for it.

Private prisons aren't the only ones that profit with prisoners. State prisons are also paid by the federal government per prison. We need to change how ALL prisons are funded, not just private prisons. Source: I have a friend that is in the state of Nevada corrections system.
#####
Yang missed a huge opportunity to call out candidates saying they will drop mass incarceration by 50% is just lip service. Remember if you like your doctor or policy you could keep it?!  Yang is a straight shooter and I have no doubt he would do as much or more to stop the mass incarceration.  More than half the prisoners in our prison system are there for violent crimes. Check the statistics!  That's why he's hesitant to just say ok!

everyone is hoping for a good king. but what you get is truman, nixon, lbj, dubya, and trump. if you think about for a little while, maybe you will conclude that the quality of national management has a lot to do with the economic decline of the nation.

#YangGang Concord CREW! LET"S GO! GET THESE BAGS
#####
Andrew Yang is as cool as the other side of the pillow. The moderator was throwing daggers and Yang ninja‚Äôd them away with truth and honesty. Once you‚Äôve committed yourself to a hard number, at least two harmful things might happen: a) you fail to reach your goal, in which case most people would just spin the results to look like a win, or, more often than not, place blame on some external force / entity, or the second thing that might happen is b) you do whatever it takes to achieve that number, even if your methods in doing so directly contradict the spirt in which you originally set out to achieve the goal. That second outcome is really scary. Yang isn‚Äôt going to commit to a number, he‚Äôs going to commit to an idea / spirit...which is the only honest answer anyone can give. #YANGGANG #YANG2020
#####
Moderator next thing you will find yourself be replace by Ai Robot a very wise thinker and got better voice .and for all the listeners you all deserve a good cruises for working hard for your country .Andrew Yang will make it UBI reality.
#####
12:17 I am a Former truck driver.The more I think about it they will need real sentient A.I. to be able to drive a truck.
#####
While Andrew Yang didn't have the numbers to commit to a 50% reduction in federal prison population, if he had the numbers in front of him, that the federal prison population is fives times what it was before the controlled substance act and other mandatory drug sentencing minimums, he would find it quite easy to commit.
#####
That girl in the front has the hots for Yang, and I don't blame her. I have the hots for Yang too.

'i would refute' what? that we are getting used to cameras?
or that we should?

Great move, don't try to strong on him and peer pressure him. Shows he's not just saying stuff to get votes... he stands for something!
#####
Imagine hosting a presidential candidate and being as glib and disrespectful as this moderator
#####
39:40  Some candidates have decided to COMMIT to reducing the jail population by 50% in a limited time frame.  That's very UNREALISTIC and any candidate that commit to an arbitrary percentage projection, is logically leaving aside the reality for a MARKETING COUP.  Those candidates may or may not know that they are wrong, either way I would tell them to study their proposals in depth before COMMITTING themselves to holding up an imaginary end of bargain.
It would be better if THOSE candidates said:  
"There is no realistic way of knowing how much we can reduce the prison-population by in our time-frame, but we are going to do everything we can"
Granted! not as SEXY as "HALF-OFF NOW!!" ;-) But at least it remains Honest.

#####
I"ve been on a Andrew Yang binge lately and i've watched dozens of his videos on youtube and i've got to say that he is more impressive the more I watch him. You think about Trump and the reasons his supporters voted for him and Yang is not only more  qualified in that sense but actually has the capacity to follow through with it. A real entrepreneur who comes from the tech industry who's business is literally getting people jobs.... on top of that I have not read one negative comment about him from either side, he goes on conservative talk shows and wins them over and you can't say that about any candidate cause they wont even appear on those shows. He's far from a career politician who uses data to solve problems he has real solutions for, he's young enough to look into the future and old enough to have the experience.  Liberal media want to stifle him in place of bigger names in the political sphere, but the people are slowly learning about him and are in full support. Go out and vote for Yang, this guy IS what we need right now to get rid of all the frustrations we've been having in politics.
#####
this mother fucker will never be president. he's a cunt
#####
The more I listen to Andrew the more I see him pander to whoever talks to him. Also he sounds a lot more left than what I imagined.
#####
Jean was great, especially when she challenged Yang. Yang was great too, I agree with everything, but I think he's gotta stop being so blunt or the opposition or the conservatives will denigrate him for being politically incorrect. Like:
"1 new hampshirian is worth 1000 californians . new hampshire is the only place where the will of the people can counter the money"
or
"my average donation is only $24. My fans are even cheaper than Bernies"
There were more but I wasnt keeping track till the end.
#####
Came to watch just a few sound bites but watched the whole thing. He's got my vote now. YangGang2020

28:14 You would refute that!? Alright, well next time you see a mugging happen in public, or you see a shoplifter stealing, You'll be pretty grateful a security camera was there to capture it and it would make. Andrew Yang said it best, its a trade-off. and when the time comes, which they will, it's a trade-off that we have to accept, and exist for a reason.

Yang Gang 2020
#####
I noticed nobody asked the hard question. China. Definitely not a serious candidate.  Paying everyone $1000 a month is just like buying votes, little more.   It's  gross over simplification. Supply and demand is a key driver of cost and demand driven by consumers is completely different from demand driven by investors. Throwing 4 trillion at the investment market is different to throwing 4 trillion at consumers. Now approx 250 million adults over 18 thus throwing 250 billion a month at consumers, thus 3 trillion per year at the consumer market will create hyper inflation and drastically reduce your buying power, especially if there's a relative scarcity of resources, which there usually is, as no resource is infinite in supply. This candidate's policies are a massive fail and thus a massive red flag at the ballot box.
#####
"If you are in jail because you deprived someone else's ability to vote, then you should not be able to vote." Andrew Yang just took the "let prisoners vote" to a whole another level. What a refreshing take on this. Letting prisoners vote is a controversial topic; however, after applying Andrew Yang's condition, it makes more sense.
#####
I wish I had him as a professor. I would never fall asleep in my class.
#####
He is the president we need! Vote him in and save our country even if the small minded people cannot comprehend his problem solving policies! We need to save people from themselves because they don‚Äôt like to read or learn these days. Secure the bag and a better future! Yang2020!
#####
That moderator was caustic and self-important. What a shame, when it would've been way more useful to get his thoughts on broader concerns rather than an attempt to unnecessarily pin him politically.
#####
Yang says the junk stuff that leftist love to hear.  His answers are the slick stuff of slavery.  I for one will have none of him.
#####
It's funny people literally laugh when they hear for first time that he wants to give every american 1k a month like it's a joke. Most people have never heard of concept of UBI. But once Andrew starts talking and explaining in detail they are finally understand it. History with look back at Andrew Yang as first politician (besides great business minds like Elon Musk) to awaken people to reality of automation and AI and UBI.
#####
Yang got the real solutions to the problems trump identified!

He doesn't mention that the move to China was the real reason that we lost 4 million jobs, not automation - No clue , he also failed at business and then ran a non-profit - not much of a record for this spoiled rich kid. I want civil rights and tiny government - not another big government stooge -
#####
Over 10:00 into his presentation, Andrew fails to mention climate crisis, the over 1 million people out of work, homeless living under bridges, in their cars and vans, in alleys, on the streets, in the woods and in homeless shelters. He also failed to bring up how important $1,000 would be in helping to solve the biggest threat to Democracy. Crony Capitalism. 
Lead with the biggest issues Andrew.
#####
I'm wondering how many 10's of millions of Americans he is planning to kill to institute his totalitarian ideology. Crazy question? I believe it was Bill Ayers who estimated it would require killing 24 million Americans in the 60's to do something similar. How many today? 50, 100 million?
#####
Guys a genius. Register as a democrat, watch more Andrew Yang videos, once hooked,  VOTE ANDREW YANG 2020
#####
Notice he said truck driving. Because it's literally that last thing keeping America going. You've never!!! Heard them speak of trucking before... Get ready folks. We're going to war again. You'll see. China wants to fight us so this isn't hard to see building.. These brains all think WAR saves economies. This is why war is somewhere all the time.
#####
If he wasn't born in the USA.. He can bug off.  Another video says he was Exiled billionaire from China.
#####
yang should run for the conservative party , hes too much of a rightie for the democratic party and stands no chance in hell of winning. Why in god green earth is this fucker still in the race ?  Hes at what ? 2% lol . You must speak to your voting base. This guy is speaking to mostly never trumpers and centrist.
#####
So the ACLU does not defend the rights of a baby that is about to be born. Good to know that the employees of ACLU are pro baby killers.
#####
So the moderator and ACLU lady doesn‚Äôt understand the meaning of public. When in public no one has the expectation of  privacy. What a complete moron and she works for the ACLU? That explains the ACLU bias and stupidly that has creeped into that organization in past 20 years.
#####
i realy like the yang gangster and UBI but im a bernie bro all the way
#####
It's ironic because the type of people who commit to random numbers (50% incarceration) are the type of people who would completely fail because they would then, later, look at the numbers and realise it's impossible.

Andrew Yang says it like it is, not some lofty goal that sounds good but no other candidate will be able to accomplish either.
#####
These questions are fantastic.

Also, don't be too hard on the moderator. They seem like they are friends that are giving each other a hard time
#####
Loser.
#####
So much social justice, Yang did great nonetheless
#####
The end of Civil Rights is Mental Healthcare promotion ex: German Nazi T4 program, add America's medical gaslighting in healthcare ... there is a reason Andrew Yang wasn't in political before running for US President, can people say TROJAN HORSE, he also wants a mandatory psychiatrist for all Presidents (to give them orders). The most wanted man in the world  ... is a psychiatrist, the guy drugging Hitler up .. a psychiatrist, every crazy person had a psychiatrist that gave them Crazy Drugs. Americans are not as dumb as Yang and Democrats think, ask them questions call them out, THEY WORK FOR U!

I personally would love to donate to his campaign, but because I am Canadian, I am not allowed to. So what I've done instead is donate money to his volunteers so that they could afford food and accommodation while they have temporarily put their jobs or schooling on hold to go door-knocking for Andrew Yang.  So far, I have sent money to Paget Kagy and Kai Watson.

I'm from Iowa, I'd vote for this Yang guy

There is a major problem with the Freedom Dividend. Andrew (nor anyone
else) ever addresses it It goes like this. 


The rationale that Andrew offers for the FD is that increasingly that
special field of the digital revolution known as artificial
intelligence (AI) is on the verge of replacing human labor with
automation and robots at a pace that is unprecedented. It is just,
fair, and right to provide compensation to displaced workers because
there is no way that they can be retrained fast enough to compensate
for the tidal wave of lost jobs and massively more income/ wealth
differential that will ensue. I have no problem with his argument so
far.

But here's where my problem starts. We view rebalancing, redistribution,
adjustments to income between income filers and the federal
government as a series of exchanges, listed out annually on ones
income tax form. Some of these exchanges, i.e., Fed Income Tax on
income, are more progressive, and some less progressive, in fact
regressive. A progressive tax is one where the less income one has
the smaller the percentage of income one is taxed, and the higher
one's income, the higher the percentage of income one is taxed.
Social Security, with a few qualifications, is not like that. For the
employee, it is a flat tax, meaning it is a certain percentage of
one's income, and the same percentage of that income, regardless of
annual income. High earners and low earners pay the same percentage. 


Now Yang's proposed 1 G per month Freedom Dividend is not exactly a tax,
but it's much the same idea: it is a redistribution of income through
the federal government. It has no special source of funding, despite
Andrew's cooking up various taxation schemes in response to the
question, How will you pay for it. It's not like the SS Trust which,
if politicians had not borrowed from it, would have its own dedicated
piggy bank. So the FD is just like income tax, except in reverse.
It's a form of tax credit, in essence. 


But it's a tax credit which is regressive, like SS is regressive, only
worse. For SS everybody pays the same percent of their income, not
the same amount from their income. In Andrews version of the FD,
everybody gets exactly the same amount of money, 1 G per month,
regardless of whether thay make millions per year or if they make
under 10G per year. That is an extremely regressive exchange. It goes
nowhere near equalizing income, and it goes nowhere near compensating
a displace truck driver's 70k per year income. 


What's worse is that it is being sold and looked on as compensation for
displaced workers whose productivity is being hijacked by AI and
robots. AI and robots are going to vastly increase How are we ever
going to begin to use the FD to deal with that further displacement,
given that it is so very regressive out the door??? That is a major
problem.

Andrew is ringing the bell,  calling to our attention a major train wreck 

among the many coming down the road.    But his  current proposal 
locks us in  to exacerbation of the problem  by  setting up a
regressive  credit.  The 1G per month figure is just arbitrary relative to the losses incurred by working people due to their displacement by automation.  We need to key income supplementation to  the income/ wealth of each person after the massive layoffs hit.  And that should be based on an amount that is much higher for low income/ wealth folks and falling off to nothing or much less for folks with higher incomes.  It needs to be a progressive credit, not a flat or regressive credit.
#####
Bingo. A little late to this party but I think I've found my candidate. Knows the problem isn't Trump, and has solutions. He's brilliant.
#####
Technology is the oil of the 21st century
#####
Yang 2020 - we need a ‚Äúnew operating system‚Äù not an old one.
#####
The US and the rest of the world need a POTUS who clearly understans and offers sensible solutions to both old problems and 21st century challenges that all of us face. Yang is the man. 
    Yang 2020.

Mr. Velshi, I enjoyed your climate change debate questions and discussion with Andrew...Thank you for that and this with #Yang2020. Cheers!
#####
I love you, Andrew, but I think you've led with the UBI enough. You also want to give the War Powers back to Congress, how many voters know that?

Funny a fair, and respectful interview with Andrew Yang. No interruptions, and no disrespect. They better start treating him better since he‚Äôs going to be our next POTUS! I‚Äôve never voted for a president before since I‚Äôve always felt like we were screwed either way. This is the 1st time I‚Äôll be voting for a president, and I even changed my affiliation to vote for him in the primary. I‚Äôm not the only non voter who will be voting for Yang. There‚Äôs a lot of us out there too! So get ready because the Yang Gang is going to make it happen. I‚Äôve also donated to his campaign which is also something I‚Äôve never done. I plan to donate more as well! Can‚Äôt wait till my shirt, and hat come in!
#####
This is like the last time they let his face be shown on their Network
#####
Love the Math ! Yang 2020 all the way ! Listening to him is so refreshing
#####
This video is in Aug.  Anyone have an update as to where Andrew Yang stands in the poll now?
#####
Viva Andrew Yang.. Incredible Bright üîÜ
#####
I need to vote for Andrew Yang
#####
Love you Andrew! Keep up the good work!
#####
Yang Gang
#####
Your way too intelligent to run for president
#####
Before you go gaga over Yang's $1000 a mont, ask if by accepting it cuts into or out your Social Security Benefits?
#####
I donated $10 for Yang. I wish I am rich so I can donate more for Yang to be president for every American citizens! #2020!! 
Honestly, if I am billionaires  I will buy Yang to be my future president!
#####
Yang 2020

Andrew Yang is the only candidate who sees the future problems and lead the country to face and solve the problems not the traditional candidates who play the old traditional games.
#####
Andrew yang for president
#####
WE NEED ANDREW YANG FOR PRESIDENT
#####
Great interview! Would love some longer ones where Yang can go into greater detail on the benefits of UBI, as there are a great many!
Hope everyone hits the like button to let MSNBC know that Yang = views!
#####
He made it for the september debate to be held on september 12
#####
He needs to be on that stage.
#####
I believe in Yang plz make America think harder
#####
Let's have more coverage of Andrew Yang!
#####
Only thing stopping Yang is voters not believing in each other.The only reason voter think Yang cannot win is because they think other fellow voters will not vote Yang. The only way to change it is get the MSM behind him and the typical way MSM get behind anyone is the money get behind the candidate and vice versa. As soon as Biden concede to Yang, Trump is finished, they will take the Senate, even McConnell could lose.
#####
Yang is a refreshing voice! Yang 2020!
#####
I donate $100. .not a gang yet..may be soon

china is also automating because they are losing jobs now to other cheaper labor countries...

UBI caught my attention, listening to his plans instead of promises got me on board!
#####
We should just do what he is saying. üëç

What he does t say is that giving everyone a grand a month will just cause retailers to raise prices to compensate for more wealth just like they do for minimum wage increases.

All the other candidates spew nonsensical jabber, while this guy talks about the big picture. He gives America real talk. We need someone who is young, educated, and a technologist, because the next wave of technology is going to be the most important yet, and the other candidates will only hold us back.

First time ever donate money for any candidates. Not fan of Democratic, but I support Yang, the person USA needs.
#####
just donated $300, #yanggang
#####
Good job msn
#####
A large percentage of jobs are at risk* of being automated.
#####
UBI would make me more willing to follow my dreams and become an aerospace engineer, (wages are suprisingly low)
#####
Ideally, this type of campaigning would win, however I don't think he will win just because he's not playing the game in front of him. He is by far the smartest candidate on the roster, but the worst at playing the game :/ 

I really hope he is loud enough that other candidates adopt his policies regardless because it's not the person that matters but the ideas. He is getting the idea of a UBI implanted in lots of people's minds and I think that's all he really wants to achieve in this campaign. I think even he knows he's not going to win.
#####
He is the only person talking about the threat of automation and trying to prepare the economy for a time when 30% of people could be unemployed due to AI and automation eradicating truck driving jobs, taxi jobs, cashier jobs, etc.
#####
He has my vote.
#####
Just donated 25 bucks!! Not much but I hope it helps! #YangGang !!

#yanggang
#####
1 candidate who actually has a plan and doesn‚Äôt say how racist trump is.  Go Yang. üëç
#####
Yang's somehow bringing together people from the left to the right to the middle, all together by focusing on the issues and opportunities that matter to America.
#####
He will really test a lot of american's.  Most people will look at him an say "im not voting for a chinese president".  America is full of many races and cultures.  Don't be brain washed into thinking America is just white or brown.  We are Many, dont sell us short with tunnel vision.  Truthfully I would vote for a rock over what we have now.
#####
Only democrat that can challenge trump
#####
Should be illegal how hard it is to find basic election info online. When is the next caucus in Texas?
#####
I live in Oklahoma where every county overwhelmingly voted for trump. I can understand why they voted for trump. They wanted a change, someone who was a non politician, an outsider, a business man. I can‚Äôt help but feel that they have been let down by this administration. I believe Yang is an excellent choice for president. Not only does he bring what Oklahomans wanted in trump but more. He is proposing solutions to problems based on facts not hyperbole. He is forward thinking and believes a trickle up economy works better than a trickle down economy. He is a young vibrant energetic and honest man. I can‚Äôt think of anybody else I would vote for.
#####
I just donated $35
#####
Real hope for USA be great again
#####
He made it! Onto the next debate #YangGang
#####
He made the fall debates!!
#####
Well just about when this was posted he qualified duh :)
#####
I think people will look back in ten years and say.. Yang called it.
#####
My question is how would the 1000 a month effect welfare or food stamp recipients?   Would programs like that be no longer needed?
#####
I don‚Äôt think Trump supporters are willing to think... and that is the majority of America...
#####
Where to donate and support? Andrew yang 2020?

I love Michael but Statham is ex British SAS and he is a for real bad ass killing machine. Sorry Rock.

If you want to put Andrew Yang in office, make sure you are registered to vote, and you vote for him in the primaries as a Democrat, so we can put him on the ballot against Trump

Comedian rich off jokes but talks down on being liberal....  how does that even make sense?  This guy might only be funny because you told me he had to be funny otherwise I laughed not a single time.

Jason Statham actually does all his own stunts, is a great kickboxer and was a professional diver and represented England in the Commonwealth games. He can probably beat the Rock up. If only Che knew how to be funny without resorting to race baiting all the time.
#####
Andrew Yang is the opposite of Donald Trump - An Asian man that likes MATH -  MAKE AMERICA THINK HARDER.  FELLOW REPUBLICANS, PLEASE LOOK AT HIS 160+ POLICIES TO HELP AMERICAN MOVE FORWARD TO THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGY. Not Left, Not Right it is Forward Together! www.yang2020.com

#####
Seth don't like Yang. Hear that tone in his voice? During the interview he finessed Che to retract his endorsement. Shady
#####
If you think politicians should have years of training and experience before running for president (and in the Trump era, it's hard to argue)... then Yang is a weird pick.
#####
Jason Statham doesn't do roids so there's that
#####
i like yang, i think he adds substance and new ideas. he is also being shafted a bit by the MSM  just like bernie and gabbard.             for the yang people out there i have a question, two actually. does yang have anything in his history to inspire trust? also yang mentioned retraining workers had success rates "between 0-15%"  does anyone know what study he is referring to?
#####
Yang IS the best candidate. Not only to beat Trump, but to lead in general. The guy with no tie is def my guy.
#####
this guy should move to a dictatorship, a lot of his wishes exist there. he clearly hates his freedom.

#####
Just showing my support!
#YangGang
#####
I don‚Äôt think Che gets it at all. He‚Äôs still examining the personality, look, and dress. He should have quizzed Che on policies he likes. Seth should have also suggested Sanders. Although I would guess he would just dismiss him as an old white Jew

There was probably a good joke somewhere in there, but did not follow his sports analogy at all.  Since when are the #1 quarterbacks and other athletes known by 15, 18, or even at draft-time?  Lebron James is more the exception than the rule.

Yes! I‚Äôll be voting for Andrew Yang!

He looks so uncomfortable in that chair.

Maybe Seth Cohen should bring Andrew Yang on the show.  :)
#####
As much as I like Yang it dosnt seem like he has any shot. 

I hope all you Yang people will vote Bernie when he drops out and endorses him.
#####
It just bums me out that Che is such an ass boil. When did SNL take a turn for the worse? When he and Jost became head writers.
#####
‚ÄúWe need‚Ä¶ a farm system for politicians.‚Äù YES, Mr. Che! 

So many civilizations, from classical Athens to pre-Maoist China, have had a professional civil service class. People trained in the right subjects  (diplomacy, economics, world history, law, public policy), took national exams (to ensure only the brightest, most promising youth moved forward), and developed their competencies through a series of increasingly difficult posts. When done correctly, it all but eliminated the chance of some ignorant jackahole winning power through a popularity contest. It was a well-paid and highly respected career, so it attracted a talented batch of candidates rather than the dregs we often get stuck with. And it tended to create a sort of mentorship relationship between like-minded colleagues of different ages, something IMO might be the biggest weakness of Democratic leadership going into election year. ::shakes head:: Another example of exaggerated American individualism come to bite us in the [butt].

This was effing hilarious!

#####
2:43 I know they're just kidding around but he completely negated his whole set up by this point. So what you're telling me is that someone with a tie is probably successful (whom you would want running the country) and an Uber driver is less so, to the point of asking him/her "what went wrong?" So, in fact, you do want your president wearing a tie, else he looks like an Uber driver. QED.

Andrew Yang is ready.

Yang Gang all the way, he's by far the best candidate. And he has no ties! No ties to lobbyists, pharma, oil executives, nothing!
#####
It's either Yang, Trump, or Bernie. I'm voting for Yang. I read up and watched videos on Yang and the other candidates.. so far Yang speaks the best, doesn't throw punches at other candidates, and speaks to US about the problems he can fix. If anyone wants a chance, they better start copying what Yang does when he is on the debate stage. While they fight with each other on who is the best person that ever existed, he's just explaining his ideas. Worst move he could make right now is to join in on the fighting.

Y'all really think Yang can get other billionaires to pay for it. Because we all know how willing billionaires are to put part of their fortune into the hands of working people. /s Bet if someone asked Yang to drop some of his own cash own low-income communities in his state he'd drop excuses instead.

You _really_ wanna be innovative? Propose the creation of resources that make it easier to secure jobs. Invest in public transportation so it's easier to get to hiring businesses that are farther away. Maybe these other motherfuckers are satisfied with having the promise of free money being woven in front of their face like a rattler, but as someone who's been struggling to get by on ~$600-700 a month for years, that alone ain't gonna cut it for me.

I agree with the presidential training, but also add testing to it. Test their knowledge of history, economics, class issues, mental health issues, drug laws, healthcare, geography, political science, etc. Train them in what they're lacking. Test their listening skills, deductive reasoning, problem solving, etc. Do mental health tests, memory tests, narcissism and sociopath tests.

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for Trickle-up (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies.

Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 

Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 3rd, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.

Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.

How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. What might work for your local community?
#####
Had he not run, most people would still be in the dark regarding the perils and potentials of Artificial Intelligence and Automation. Our way of life is undergoing a fundamental shift and those career politicians  were so clueless and still talking about old problems and their outdated solutions. 
Yang's ideas will impact the world much much beyond anyone can imagine. That is already beginning to happen as you can see in the comments section of many Yang videos. So many non-americans are already hailing this man as a visionary and his solutions as incredibly in step with the times.
#####
Tulsi and Yang for president 2020.  Ubi for Americans.
#####
Dude's a clown
#####
I'm starting to understand why Yang is different.  Old politics is about making up reasons to why they're screwing up so bad.  Andrew Yang is about honesty backed by data, truth, and common sense.
#####
That's because no one is really digging into what he is saying. Most of 
his stuff doesn't hold up. Here's someone who did some homework:

All he needs to get into double digits is for people to HEAR HIM! When you tell people you are binge-watching a candidate, they need to be told it will not be dry! He is literally entertaining to listen to!
#####
I wish we could see the expressions on the panel's faces, because I get the sense they're charmed.
#####
Man, I just watched Bernies, and cannot comprehend why his supporters find him the only candidate who makes sense and speaks eloquently, I personally found it nuts. YANG for POTUS

39:45 im so glad he aligns with Castro on immigration. I do like Castro, but Yang has a more holistic approach üôÇ
#####
Just got the bad news. A trash man Bloomberg jumped out as democrat candidate. That means Yang can not get support from the powerful man of democrat. People of American will be beaten down to the floor again by the huge Capital. So awful.
#####
Feel free to take my first few UBI checks and put them into your campaign account sir. #Yanggang

I am not an American, but I watched and observed  him for a quiet time, I think he is the one who can change America and  save it from it's problems. I noticed he  has a good knowledge and he has ideas and solutions for all  American issues.  He is well prepared for solving  American issues. He should be selected and become president for America. He is far better than Trump and other candidates.
#####
it is very interesting that interviewers always ask only serious questions to Yang! 
it is almost like intrinsically they understand that he has an answers that will solve problems
he is a solutions guy 
he is running to solve the problems that he sees is coming in the future
he will get the country read to face the future
#####
He is a positive game changer who can and will change the US and the rest of the world in a very significant way.
#####
1st question: Tell us something about yourself.  - Andrew: These are the problems of journalism and these are my solutions. ... And now about myself.
#####
For once Im interesting on proposal which actually make a lots of sense! Such a brilliant man with a fantastic plan!
#####
Andrew nailed this interview. He truly has thought about everything and has a solution. I wish more people can watch this.
#####
I only watch about 300 interviews of Andrew, I need more.
#####
Andrew Yang is the real deal. Eloquent, intelligent and a strong leader. He has the vision to bring us Americans into a brighter future. Lets win this, America! @t   Vote!!
#####
Its called a dividend, like its a corporate payout. Makes sense when you think about The Act of 1871

A lot of nurse practitioners also dislike working in rural areas. Also, their training is widely varied with approximately 20 times less than new physician graduate who just finished residency. This ultimately may influence patients safety at the end. If they are to help alleviate primary care shortage, there needs to be contract like 5-10 year for these newly (with proper training) nurse practitioner grads to work in rural areas.

58:26 "Unfortunately our political conversations have degenerated into symbols and value statements, you know?..and tribalism. And so, what we need to do is we need to actually start looking at the problems on the ground and people sense that's what I'm all about, that im highly practical and numerate and I don't care about who's idea it was, if its a good idea lets run with it."

This is why Yang is America's greatest hope!

You know he is genuine because he‚Äôs been consistent as far as where he stands. For example when asked about de-criminalizing illegal immigrants, he was consistent with his answer. Also he had reiterated twice that illegal immigrants have been made a scape goat for the loss of jobs in the US. He says it as it is without apologizing no matter who he‚Äôs talking to. In this case ppl of red state.
#####

What stands out the most about Yang is that he seems to understand most of the real problems facing regular americans, and even tried to think of solutions for them. All the other candidates just default to Trump, immigration, save earth, and LGTBQ....
#####
My first thought after watching this interview was "WOW". I decided to comment and the first comment I see is also "wow, I found my candidate." How has our politicians been so out of touch, why are there no more like Andrew Yang. Logic, human/community center, no afraid to listen and solve problems, willing to stand for the people! WOW I also found my candidate.
#####
i can't hear the questions. need  louder mic

"wow...I mispronounced your name already!"

don't worry hon, you're not the only one :)

holy! this guy knows a lot and answer questions straight forward, no bullsh*t.
#####
Sure, giving someone $1000 per month might make some folks just want to sit around, but look at how many other folks will now have $1000 to spend at businesses that would be forced to hire more workers and create jobs? And how many people who would be able to take a passion career that may start at a lower pay because they don‚Äôt have to worry about the bottom line? 

And I always want to ask the person who asks this question: are you going to quit your job if you get ex extra $1000 a month? Do you know anyone who would quit their jobs? If now... why do you assume there will be such a significant amount of people who would?

Haven't watched the video yet, infact haven't checked the channel in years since you changed the style up. Looking forward too more talking instead of just drinks,sky john days and even with more interaction with the presenters where hilarious.

If he doesn't finish that drink...it's a deal breaker for me..he won't get my vote

LMAO! The simple solution is to not allow robot trucks!  I don't care how much money they make!  And the first few lawsuits are certain to set this back decades/ Not to mention the trucks would have to build their own roads!  As tax payers aren't going to be taxes to lose their jobs.  or give up the road they paid for . For robot trucks.  And delivery trucks would have to put away and rotate stock . They are decades away from that! This sounds more like another Climate change boggy man to scare the stupid!

so Meghan (and the rest of republicans) are against divorce but are also against free marriage counseling? So they just want couples to be in an unhappy marriage FOREVER unless they can afford good counseling? Ridiculous.

The comment "No one at this table needs an extra $1000 a month" is a perfect example from the "Have all" and their ignorance for not thinking about the mass of the population of the "Have not". Just because the people at the table don't need it, it doesn't mean they speaks for the rest of America. If you don't need it, donate! There are a large amount of citizens that are living paycheck to paycheck... And increasing "minimum wage" doesn't do a darn thing when they see only a few bucks increased on their paycheck! Andrew Yang was very composed talking to them... I would have got irritated...

Meghan cmon honey not everyone is a acholic and stupid those 1000 can be useful for rent food supplies college family or savings for an emergency #Yang2020 #securethebag

Freedom Dividend and the marriage counseling would be optional.
No one is shoving stuff in your face, no one is forcing it on you.
It would be freely available to you and it is your choice whether to take it or not.
That's the beauty of it. it's your decision. 
and if youre like meghan who doesn't need an extra $1000 and just
needs liquor and a gun to vent her problems that's cool too
#####
Yes, we need to destigmatize mental health issues. I am very impressed with his perspective.  Many people are struggling in life and need help.  They should not feel ashamed of facing their problems and seeking help.

Andrew yang's comment about Israel was very disappointing he needs to better educate himself on this critical issues or seek advice from advisors/confidante in foreign policy before he losses his ever - increasing supports.

Good ideas but I don‚Äôt see him as president nor will he ever be. I‚Äôll gladly eat my own words if I‚Äôm wrong. ‚úåÔ∏è

So, did Mccain get this job because she has a vast knowledge and interesting perspective of the world and politics, or did she literally get this job by her name?  From this interview alone, she looks to be in no shape to be involved in discussions like this.  And if she's the representative of the conservative perspective, I would say she just makes her people look bad.  I hope she will drink some Jack Daniels and shoot some guns to get over this comment.
#####
$1000 a month will help the normal working class citizens of American. Of course those Heffas at the table don‚Äôt need the money because they don‚Äôt live paycheck to paycheck. They forgot there are people that aren‚Äôt well off.

I was in a beauty pageant to pay for college and the general knowledge question was; "If you had a the money in the world what would you do with it?"

My answer;  It is the scarcity of money that gives it value. If I had all the money then I'd most likely use it as insulation because it would have no value otherwise.

This man doesn't understand banking. He made some money but that doesn't mean he knows anything about it.

Everyone please register as a democrat to vote for this man!!!

Yes! United comment here. Go AY!!!

‚ÄúMy version of marriage counseling is drinking jack daniels, shooting some guns, and hanging out‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt need to go to counseling, I just drink away my feelings and shoot my guns when I‚Äôm angry, I‚Äôm so healthy and cool üòé
#####
YANG 4 PRESIDENT..1000 dollars goes a long way..
#####
the producers on the view knew McCains far right views when they hired her...like everything else , including the main stream medias,  it is all about revenue and ratings , and she is their cash cow... the poster girl for having everything handed to her since birth... just like trump was...he is medias cash cow... if trump loses... the medias might have to resort to telling the news ....god forbid.....
#####
Drinking Jack Daniels and shooting guns. What could possibly go wrong...
#####
At this point, every media outlet feels the need to bring up the fact that he once answered to someone's question about circumcision over Twitter. It's not a part of his platform - stop asking him about it. It's such a cheap ploy for a sound bite...he addressed the question multiple times and frankly it was never a question your viewers were hoping you'd cover.
#####
Hmmm. I didn't know alcohol solves problem. Wtf. On top of that when hammered pull out the "gun" and start shooting. Is this lady 4real. I'll take the marriage counseling ty verymuch.
#####
I‚Äôd love it if Meghan were no longer allowed to speak. She completely missed the point, yet again...
#####
brilliant idea.... when I`m angry with my wife... I`ll just drink a couple of JDs, grab my gun and some bullets... 
that`ll fix every argument. üòÇüò≠üíÄ
#####
Build the wall!!! And shut the fk up Yanger! You are a MORON
#####
Someone PLEASE make a gif of Meghan‚Äôs reaction to giving to charity.
#####
‚ÄúNo one at this table needs an extra $1,000 a month‚Äù You speak for yourself every day Megan, you speak for yourself again.
#####
Racist show!!!
#####
And the Yang Gang will come on here complaining that we didn‚Äôt see the unedited three-hour interview.
#####
Path to citizenship to illegal immigrants? Also Federal marriage counseling? What else should the Government do pay your mortgage? Clean your toilet?.....
#####
Thank you guys for having him on and giving him a voice! His supporters appreciate it, and America will appreciate it in 2020!
#####
I love Whoopi at the end. When she says "I'm gonna keep an eye on you," you just know she's going home to watch the JRE show. I think Sunny already watched it three times. Low key #YangGang.
#####
so meghan's version of marriage counseling is killing her husband lol
#####
Why does Meghan always talk like she‚Äôs all pissy and something is up her a$$?!!
#####
Andrew Yang - #YangGang   Vs.   Donald Trump #PrisonGang.    2020!
#####
she doesn't need $1k, she needs a husband that loves her for who she is.... that's gonna be tough.
#####
strawmanning here from meghan.  1) Andrew doesn't make it a requirement for couples to do periodic counseling.  It's an option available to those who WANTS it.  You can opt out if you think alcohol is better. 2) a thousand dollars for meghan isn't so much about meghan paying for her needs.  It's the idea of non-discriminating so that it's no longer politicized (those who get vs those who don't), lean down administriative cost from the govt perspective (no need for someone at a desk making decision over each and every case), eliminate disincentivizing people from working harder (I wouldn't want to work harder or find a better paying job for an extra 12000 when I know I might lose my free 12000)
#####
reparation is a hard NO
#####
mental health does need to be destigmatized in this country, I wish I had free access as a teen
#####
Well one thing it would remind them there still a American brilliant
#####
Andrew Yang sounds like he has thought about lots of ways to help our country. His website has over 100 policies - they were only able to touch on a fraction of them during the interview. It was nice to see each one of the hosts agree with several of his policies. Imagine what $1,000/month for every adult in your family could do for them! Yang2020.com/policies
#####
McCain hasn‚Äôt even been married for 2 full years yet. I don‚Äôt really think she‚Äôs in a great position to be discounting the benefit of having a marriage counselor available IF a couple wants one
#####
Lol let‚Äôs see how long Meghan and her husband last
#####
They should staff a psychologist for the set of The View (specifically for the manic adult baby at the table)
#####
I dont see whats wrong with the comment meghan said about shooting and drinking? I thought she was implying that every parent was different, so in her relationship its shooting guns and drinking as a extreme to make a point.
#####
Andrew never ignores questions on purpose, that makes him totally different from any other candidates from democracts
#####
Jesus Christ, can we please pretend this embarrassing fucking clown never happened?
#####
She probably has a bad marriage and bringing up marriage counseling triggered her. What was meant to be sarcasm came off as defensiveness. I can read her like a book.

For me, I've whittled my choices down to Yang, Buttigieg, Gabbard or Williamson.  Hopefully all the candidates get speaking time in the next debates

Great candidate, would love to see more with him!
#####
Sorry if I'm rich and getting a thousand dollars free I'm not giving it away

Joy is so stupid. Why should rich white people get a thousand dollars a month? So what... Rich non white propped deserve it? Go shove it Joy

#####
Whose the hideous illiterate white girl?  Inbred immigrants took our jobs
#####
Meghan, yes there are homeless veterans in the streets, which is why you have a guy on your show talking about giving EVERY American $1000 a month smh
#####
I like this man very much! He speaks a "powerful message" on serious topic being dealt with separately....I wont repeat his words but his mental alertness is amazingent for such a young man powerful statements...true words that show for-thought and respect for all Americans as a unit. This a apart of the asian cultures perspective here now in America.
#####
Has marriage counseling ever saved anyone‚Äôs marriage?  I‚Äôm actually curious.
#####
I would like a cleaner ocean
#####
Meghan loves playing dumb but she doesn't realize that she seems the dumbest
#####
Man is that lady on the right dumb
#####
Andrew Yang is the only democrat I'd vote for. It's a shame he'll get blown out of the water by elites that will ultimately lose to Trump.
#####
2:30 Get drunk and shoot some guns???? 
She is not serious, right?
#####
heh I love how she is confused and shifting through her cards 1:22
#####
The right way is to de-stigmatise mental health issues and address them, not drink them down with whiskey...
#####
Whoopie is the only one that makes sense
#####
Yang will be POTUS God willing

lol is it me or did they tell them they couldn't talk politics?
#####
Yang2020...Andrew Yang is amazing...I am voting for him...
#####
Snoopdog: many  labels were focused on rap 
Many were focused on R&B
And he was able to do em both 
I have a feeling we would be sayin this about yang in 2020 
There were lefts , there were rights and Yang was able to unite them both üòÇüòÇüòÅ

Lol fun. Great yang and hip popper lol
#####
MSNBC ignores Andrew Yang, but here he is with Ari Melber. Although, Ari usually ask great questions but none of this covers anything about Andrew Yang running for President. Just weird!
#####
Watching this clip from July in end October. Nice to see the more stature as a candidate Andrew has now, and he keeps on joking.
#####
Was only here to see yang
#####
He is just too smart and cool.
#####
Someone's getting banned from the garden.
#####
Homeless in America is growing. It is affecting many business. Andrew's freedom dividend would help our economy. It take money spending in an economy to make the next future millionaire and billionaire.
#####
Yin Yang Gang's presidential sound track will be more lit than Obama's and Trump's. I guarantee it.
#####
La belle actually means the beautiful
#####
Oh MAN I was hoping when they were talking about LaBelle's name, he said something about John Yang
#####
LOL no more "John Yang" now right MSNBC? ;) You guys have been doing better at covering Yang so keep up the good work...expecting more ***positive*** content like this from you!!!!!!!!!! Thanks!!!!!!!!!
#####
yang seem tired on this show... not the greatest performance i seen from him
#####

Before you go gaga over Yang's $1000 a month, find out if by accepting it you loose your Social Security Benefits?

MSNBC sucks

ANDREW YANG ALLLLLL THE WAYYYYYY!!!!!! RISE UP WITH PRESIDENT ANDREW YANG 2020!!!! MR.YANG MAKES ME PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN FINALLY!!!! VOTING FOR PRESIDENT YANG THIS TIME...SORRY THAT TRUMP DID NOT DELIVER ON HIS PROMISES TO "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!"
#####
"Forks over Knives" is a game-changer.  Being vegan only makes sense.  Forget eating cells from dead animals, which is mostly processed cartilage with chemicals for coloring and flavor.
#####
It‚Äôs really strange that MSNBC features Yang in a sense that is supposed to be ‚Äúnegative‚Äù but can feature anything else positive or even important about his campaign

Hey, He's "French grammar" literate, nice surprise. üëç

why have both of them at the same time?

The more I see Yang, the more I find myself rooting for him for president. Him and JD sitting next to each other just having a normal conversation is so...idk, refreshing? Cool? Yang is just so chill. He's like the neighbor down the street who you drive & wave to when you pass him as he's watering his way too green and perfectly trimmed grass.

Yang is above this squabbling form of intellectual discussion. AndrewYang is more mature and modest than this political spectacle #2020yanggang

President yang

DSJ, RJ Barrett, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis and Julius Randle could make the playoffs.

he deserves to win after being a knicks fan

Wow! this is a MSNBC video ?! with Andrew on ?! and they're laughing together ?!
#####
"If Yang can unite a YouTube comment section, he can unite a country."

Hated all dems running until I saw this dude, and by god, he seems like the most sane and logical canidate, who actually cares about the people in this country. Hes got my vote
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Yang is the only candidate who talks about the 4th industrial revolution, if u don't understand the impact of it, let me give u an example, before the 1st industrial revolution we were the richest nation on Earth, after the 1st industrial revolution we were one of the poorest countries, why, because we didn't have the knowledge n skills to qualify for a job so the 4th IR will be the same for the poor n less qualified people , I'm not American but just wanted to share my country's experience so Americans please vote for Yang..follow the Yang gang.
#####
SHARE YANG VIDEOS!!

Dont just like, VOTE

I'm subscribe to MSMBC when they've treated Yang with respect more than once, this is the first time I've seen this channel doing anything other than smearing progressives.  The way they're treating Bernie is frankly pathetic.

I love how in every comment section regarding Yang I see both left and right in agreement, I noticed that usually the few that criticize him are often bitter and aggressive in their comments.
#####
Andrew is lovely! Just so authentic and down to earth
#####
Yang is going to be the coolest president ever. I'm so excited for 2020.
#####
Good to see a candidate that can be a real human being during interviews
#####
Yang got himself up to almost 2% approval. At this rate He'll be President when he's 306 yrs. old. Let's know when it's time to self-thin the herd YangDrain.

Hope more people see this side to Andrew Yang.  As much as I hate it, people tend to vote based on who they'd like to have a beer with, so showing his more lighthearted side talking sports and popculture can only help.

If you have Bills & Brains Vote #AndrewYang

They better back him
#####
Ok, let's begin with congrats that the $12k made a difference for the Fossi family. Now let's look into this further: they paid $10k to college tuition and if Bernie has his public college tuition plan implemented they wouldn't have to pay this and on top of that not have any new college tuition payments. Second, the father spent $1200 for mental health but under Bernie's Medicare4All plan mental health is covered so he wouldn't have to pay for this. In addition, Medicare4All most likely would save this family money since they wouldn't have to pay deductibles, co-payments, or premiums. Third, with Bernie against unfair trade deals (he's similar to Trump in this case but would go through congress to implement rather then executive order) as well as increasing unions and wages could help this family earn more money annually. I suspect if they did the research and actually broke down the numbers they get come further ahead under a Sanders Administration. It's not to late to do more research. Go to Bernie's issue page at https://berniesanders.com/issues/

It does notwork !

Greater Boston: How do you call this ‚Äújournalism?‚Äù This is just a biased piece of editing centered around lazy reporting and lack of facts. 

Now it makes me wonder how often GB takes videos out of context just for clicks...

Greater Boston‚Äôs next piece should be a video of this news anchor saying, ‚ÄúI like children to have access to clean water,‚Äù but cut the video short right before ‚Äúto have access to clean water.‚Äù Different topic, but same exact process.
#####
Who edited this video??? Whoever you are, you‚Äôre very lucky! Most people LOSE THEIR JOB for not doing their jobs right. 

He was not caught flat-footed. He didn‚Äôt hear the question on-stage (different than clarity of the audio recorded on the moderator‚Äôs mic).

Talk about BIASED media and lazy reporting. UBI is paid mostly by VAT tax. How about spending at least 10 seconds on that than this narrative of skepticism and doubt?

I can see why the people are so distrusting of media news because news is not news anymore, it‚Äôs just MEDIA.

Endorse this once in a life-time candidate who is uniting this country, Andrew Yang: yang2020.com

People have 21st century questions, he has 21st century solutions: yanglinks.com

UBI will help a lot of Americans transition smoother during the 4th Industrial Revolution and live a better life.

every got UBI  from trump pockets...
#####
What a great example of bad journalism. Shame on news like this for deliberately making it seem like Andrew Yang was "caught flat footed" when in fact he simply didn't hear the last part of the question. All Andrew talks about is his extremely detailed plan for UBI.
#####
Yang is a problem solver.  His ideas work for every single family in United States.   Pass this message to everyone and millions of people will follow him like you never seen before.  Yang, our new president....our life will be happier and our economy will be the greatest in America.  Yesssssss!   I am ready for Yang and ready to change my life for the better.

Why I support Yang https://youtu.be/k1UbV2GAdNE

UBI/ FD Andrew Yang/ yanggang woooohoooooo! üëç
#####
MSNBC messed with his mic and they also did the same to Williamsons mic.  

Why don't news organizations report on this violation our Democratic process ?
#####
My rights are a priority over 1k a month, and he is anti-gun. If he supported the second amendment 100%, I would consider him. But a candidate should have the priority of preserving our rights in my book and I don't see that with any Democrats.

Before people call me a gun loving white man, I'm a minority woman, and I encourage you to research why the 2nd amendment is so important.
#####
I love how this fat cat white asshole leaves out the next part. He did not hear the question. He went on to answer it perfectly. I may be white and a "certain age" but I am sick to death of this attitude in our country. Uh wait. Their country. These kind of people and the big corporations have stolen it from us. It is their country now.
#####
Before you go gaga over Yang's $1000 a month, ask "If I accept this does it cut into or out my Social Security Benefits?
#####
Even when things are cheap,if I don‚Äôt have the money I can‚Äôt afford it.UBI creates instant confidence in peoples and investment is going to rushes in as everyone has some extra money to spend,a recession is when people stopped spending,not because there‚Äôs no money in the country,suddenly many people wants to be an American,Why not,?1000 dollars free money for everyone.Free water starts the stream flowing.
#####
one-hundred thousand a year my income is $12,000 a yr. and I am proud to say I worked for my money. At the age of 66, I am applying and looking for part-time work.

Andrew yang next President of the United States good policy not racism
#####
Anybody else who can use it I know I could
#####
I went to yang.com they tell you to sign up then it take you to 2more steps and 9thells you to donate money then takes you to buy hats pins t-shirts etc but all other websites and the NEWS MEDIA REPORTED YOU DONT HAVE TO BUY OR PAY FOR ANYTHING IF HE HELP THIS FAMILY IT IS A BLESSINGS HELP ME YANG LORD KNOWS I NEED IT AND COULD USE IT
#####
This is such a lie all white people are rich. And Andrew yang is Asian impossible for him to have money because this country is so racist.
#####
Dear Mr Yang, money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees u libtard.
#####
Bad journalism
#####
Right on! I live in Hawaii and I paint free murals for the people and give to the community by volunteering for Red Cross and Volunteer Firefighting near Hilo. I have served my country and I will vote for Trump again in 2020, because  he has been doing a great job for blacks and Hispanics and unemployment and border reform and resistance to illegal immigration. Also, I know and understand his love of many people and  that he has been painted poorly. That is a shame. Have a great day out there! Aloha!
#####
Caught flat footed?...Are you sure?......
#####
I‚Äôm not even surprised.  Shameless unethical journalism.  üôÑ
#####
Way to call someone ‚Äúflatfooted‚Äù while two more seconds wouldve proven that it wasnt the case. Your news organization is a joke for that. 
Stop pretending like people cant look up the original footage on youtube. Its 2019.
#####
I knew they were gonna edit this ‚Äúsorry?‚Äù part just like this to make him look ridiculous. Fuck them.
#####
Silent malfunction everytime Yang turns to answer.watch it will be an old tricks.people are wiser now and can see it clearly.
#####
News loves controversy.  It's clear that he just didn't hear the question.  I think sometimes it's hard for people to move from a scarcity to an abundance lifestyle and to believe that we really can make these necessary changes.  Frankly when I first heard of UBI, I rejected it outright, but once I dug more into the policies it really made sense.
#####
He didn‚Äôt hear the question you‚Äôre lying sir
#####
So disingenuous to say Yang was caught flatfooted by the question. At least the family got to show how the Freedom Dividend would work.
#####
looks like this video backfire
#####
Watching from Northeast India,Mizoram.
#####
As a lifelong Republican who became Independent about 2 years ago, I must say that Andrew Yang is perhaps the most Independent candidate that is running from a partisan capacity. He is smart, experienced, honest, and exactly what America needs to bring back the slogan, "United We Stand"
#####
All they had to do was repeat the question not a big deal
#####
Tech can fail.  Earphones and Mics have been known to fail.

But......the whole hook of the he piece was Andrew yang being asked how he's going to pay fornit and him faulterring. You didn't let him explain or go over it
#####
Mumbles "Howdydudat?" 
"I'm sorry? Was that English?"
#####
Customers and company owners all eat and buy clothing.  This cycle makes up our economy, so it's only a matter of time when our government gets almost all of it back.  Taxes are little but always retrieve money for our government from every seller, and every buyer.  The economy only crashed because everybody didn't have money.  Now, it's going to bloom, and work for us now, afer a while.
#####
#WGBHNews, do your homework before you say some shit like that...
#####
Yang got my vote! that $1000 gonna pay off my mortgage much sooner!
#####
Yang's proposal will definitely be needed at a some point whether this is the tipping point is very questionable. Watching a number of his explanations he makes a number of very questionable assertions that have as much substance as the trickle down economy assertions.
#####
Great...then Yang can pay for Everybody and keep his Taxocrat mitts out of my wallet.
#####
Your a idiot. He didn't hear " how are you going to do it " get some younger people on u-tube.
#####
Lmao "flat footed" they are so scared of Yang lol
#####
He clearly just didn't hear the question???
#####
Andrew Yang: P ‚úî
Tulsi Gabbard: VP ‚úî

#####
I swear if Trump wins again instead of AY, then this country has no more hope ><
#####
So he got laid off and acted like a bitch and sat at home? Maybe get off your ass and find that fuckin dog!! ‚ÄúGet a job‚Äù üòÇüòÇ if this happens, the country is going into debt worse than my province here in Canada.
#####
Media editing at it's best...
#####
Yang's brilliant indeed. Helping out a family that might not even gonna vote for him. It just goes to show that UBI is for all Americans. It will draw people's attention from other candidates. Brilliant!!!
#####
it will be entertaining watching the diff ways they try to destroy yang . they wont ever change my mind , im going to vote yang no matter what they say .
#####
I follow this guy ironically.
#####
Ubi will not help the poor as yang proposes that using any welfare will forgo Ubi eligibility. It will not help the middle class as it is funded by VAT and will easily be absorbed by increased base prices as a result. And it will not help the rich as they already have money. It's essentially a way to transfer wealth from the middle class to upper class at an accelerated rate. It's a publicity stunt to purchase votes.
#####
Yea what would ppl buy that is worth that much money
#####
I‚Äôm glad he accurately portrayed how it would be paid for and how it is opt-in so it doesn‚Äôt hurt anybody currently getting assistance.
#####
Blocking this channel from appearing in my recommendations now. 

Any channel that lies as big as this, claiming he was caught flat-footed when there's clear evidence of massive mic issues deserve to die.
#####
YangFor2020
#####
We get the majority rule in voting. But shouldn't the example families on front street (being touted) be "Native American" and "African American" lower and lower-middle class families/individuals?
#####
Maybe in 2024. *Trump 2020*. Security of our country and to put back to work American born/legal citizens displaced by illegals is more important right now.
#####
Andrew Yang is fast & furious üëè
#####
So thoughtful that Mr. Fassi spoke of others who might've been more deserving of their UBI situation. We are definitely all better minded if we are not stressing over making ends meet.
#####
The US people are being conned. You have been convinced it is nasty and wrong for you to benefit and get something tangible from your flourishing economy. There is plenty of money it's just that the rich are getting it all just like the tax cuts 83% of benefits went to the rich.
#####
The only people who will be stumbling will be the people who didn't believe Andrew yang would win.
#####
NO NEW TAXES! 3.2 TRILLION in new spending in the first year! 12.8 TRILLION in his first term! Who is going to pay for this? THE MIDDLE CLASS AS ALWAYS!!
#####
Yes a total game changer
#####
He's lying. That isn't possible. Apple the most successful company in America wouldn't be able to give at most 1% of Americans a thousand dollars a month. So we're would all the money come from? There's 250 million adults in the US. Times that by a thousand and imagine companies giving that away on a monthly basis. Yeah fucking right YANG. I wish
#####
Andrew Yang gives another white family free money.  YAWN
#####
Anecdotal evidence in support of UBI.  Thats the best Yang can provide?

Show us proof that UBI will generate new jobs, reduce hospital visits,  reduce crime and all the rest that you claim to hold the cure for.

Snake Oil.
#####
Horrible journalism.
#####
The question was "haiwooddjeditt?" No wonder he couldn't hear it at first. He crushed his answer and his ridiculous 3 minutes.
#####
love this!!!
#####
Yes now I can buy a new Range Rover üòé
#####
KYS: Keep Yang Speaking!!
#####
We do not need free money that will ruin our economy.
#####
Media will hate and attack Yang, but he shall rise above.

I'm voting for Andrew yang
He's the smartest of the bunch
I want you to vote for him too.
#####
He heard: Why would you do that!? That's why he said sorry.
#####
Completely took him out of context, he actually answered the question right after that. The bias is clear, they don‚Äôt want Yang to speak and it‚Äôs blatant corruption to frame him out of context like this and try to make him look bad. Do the research yourself on Yang, don‚Äôt buy this fake news.
#####
The host is just taking things out of context. Due to the sound issues, Andrew Yang just didn‚Äôt hear the question clearly, and nor did many other candidates. He has answered that question a million times in the past in numerous interviews. In addition, if you continue the clip, you will see him answer the question elaborately and eloquently. Seriously, watch the original clip and stop taking things out of context. Stop misinterpret and mislead the audience on purpose! Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
I liked the video because the story from the family was touching. The editing at the beginning was amateurish. BTW, Yang is much more than just UBI. Please visit is website and give his policies a look.
#####
This is how the Todd billy asked the question: ‚ÄúAndrewYouGotThisBigAssBaddassPolicyThatOneHeardOfAndYouAreHwarTodayToGetThatPolicyKnowNowHowDoYouGoAboutGettingThatNessageAcross‚Äù.  ..who the fuck would understand that..
#####
Say it with me. "No More Old Guys". We need a person like Andrew Yang, who will help Americans help America.
#####
Andrew Yang is every where.

Andrew Yang has my vote
#####
Andrew Yang Has The Best Policies For Senior Citizens.

#####
Everyone Vote for Yang, he's really the only candidate that's going to make a real tangible impact on your life.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!
#####
If Yang becomes president and his freedom dividend gets implemented and everyone of us gets 1k a month, he will be more than just a president. He's god sent.
#####
How about AY ask Tesla CEO & Reddit CEO to support 10 families each 1k/m for 1 year? This would be epic for AY opening statement at the debate night.

A missed opportunity to point out that $1000 a month may enable young people to live near their aging parents in rural areas and small towns, even if the job market is a bit difficult there.

Yang 2020. He isn‚Äôt just thinking inside the box and proposing bandaids for the problems. He‚Äôs changing the whole box to eliminate problems and bandaids because bandaids don‚Äôt work.
#####
I think Yang is an AI and I still support him.
#####
Yang 2020!!!
#####
Yang is the man. I cannot believe he isnt the #1 leader right now.
#####
YANG GANG 2020 but lol old people dont watch youtube so i don't know how an aarp ad will help
#####
I‚Äôm for Andrew Yang but I‚Äôm not sure whether the UBI was for EVERY adult until the day they die like he said here or for 18-64 year olds that I‚Äôve seen/heard previously. Just wanting clarification. #yanggang
#####
Only candidate that always has a plan. Nice job Andrew. #YangGang2020
#####

#####
If every American adult gets $12k a year for kind of free, then wouldn't that mean job salaries will decrease and there will be a price inflation?
#####
Body language like a mf
#####
Yang is so sound and decent... we almost don‚Äôt deserve him
#####
Let me know if any other Dem candidate talking about eliminate the cap on social security tax. Yang is the only one that I have heard so far. I just do not understand those Dems talking about raise the cap rather than eliminate it. It sounds to me those people have a great deal of friends int he top 1% that they want to take care of?
#####
This idiot will turn us into Venezuela quicker than any other candidate.
#####
Yang2020!!
#####
Every time I watch a YouTube video on Andrew Yang, I never see a negative comment
#####
wake up clowns, this is the real candidate. why is he still polling at 2%??? ffs
#####
Not left and not right. It's for all

If I could retire well and have that extra still it would be great cause I could invest so much in my kids and grandkids that much more.

#####
Yang Gang!!! He probably has the best chance of beating Trump.
#####
He is just gaslighting u. Initial he didn‚Äôt included SS in his ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù dividen
#####
So does yang intend his dividend in place of or in addition to social security? Initially I thought his dividend was for adults up to the age of 64?
#####
Yang Gang in full force what great answers!

I‚Äôm a trump supporter. I cannot stand any democrat currently running. But if Yang gets the nomination I‚Äôm switching parties.

Really AARP?????.... Switching my mother, dad , aunts, uncles, neighbors , your neighbors to BlueShields ü§£ü§™
#####
UBI
$3120 trillion per year.
#####
Yang is Asian and ha zero concept of the Black struggle in America.. the fact that he would suggest a white privileged monied family should be given the SAME amt as a poor disenfranchised Black family ($1000) is lauaghably absurd. yeah lets give whites reparations too..
#####
$ 2,400,000,000,000 a year? That's two trillion four hundred billion a year to pay everyone $1000. a month, let's get real people!!!
#####
Yang would let China bend over america , he has no position except being nice to them , red flag
#####
Everybody that are willing to vote for him, please urge people to check out his proposals, interviews and ideas! I mean on every media outlet you can think of (as comments on youtube videos for example, posts on ig/fb...), talking to people about him... Let's get him elected!
#####
The average comment on this video has more likes than the actual videos of many of the other candidates, not to mention Yang has the best like to dislike ratio of any candidate. #YANGGANG #YANG2020 #MATH
#####
Beautiful speech. It‚Äôs good to see Andrew Yang speaking directly to the people.
#####
I like most of his arguements and policies , what I wish for him most to do is add standard goals that addup to $1000 monthly, like graduating highschool, yearly healthchecks, immunization & 3-5 years away from Inchoate or worse crimes, employment counceling/training(for jobless).
What worries me is that giving everyone $1000 will cause the dollar to loss some of its buying power. I don't know how much but it will happen due to everyone having an extra $1k sitting around each month is questionable.(supply vs demand kind of balance)
I sadly don't think the democratic party will allow him a good chance however, based off their previous election...
#####
Yang He Give all people free  money? Where he git money?? He sell Ancient Chinese Secret name of CALGON???
 Yang he NO CAN DO he Commie Bastard!

You need to pull a Better Call Saul and run this commercial right after Matlock.

*I'm dumbfounded to those people who doesn't think having $1,000 a month would help their lives.* The rich doesn't care and I understand that but it's very selfish of them as well.
#####
I think reps and dems do like this candidate...
Finally we can like almost the same thing...
#####
Sound like Kermit The Frog. 

Vote Bernie.

Andrew Yang is the one who is my fav

Let's dream for a minute. Imagine retiring in a world run by Andrew Yang and Elon Musk. Oh yeah, that's a world I want to see.

Let's do it with Andrew Yang. This is the 21st century and we need a new vision of which Yang proposes to get America going forward not backward like other politicians proposals.
#####
TULSI GABBARD 2020 !!!!!!!
#####
Tbh Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders are doing it right by going on podcasts that us normies watch. Does anyone really even watch or trust mainstream media anymore? By going on these podcasts they can easily persuade the younger generation that watch this channel.
#####
If you gave $1000 every month there would be a lot of lazy people that do nothing just buying booze and lottery tickets.
#####
Yang is a democratic version of Ben Shapiro, that would be very interesting.

Man trump will beat this mofo TRUMP 2020
#####
This guy reminds me of my doctor.
#####
Feel like yang is a republican inside
#####
If he doesn't win then it's definetly rigged
#####
I ‚ù§ Andrew Yang
#####
Andrew wants the UBI to keep the money flowing in the community where it benefits the people most rather than letting the government, big coporations, banks, insurance companies and wealth folks hoard it and missuse it. Remember the sub-prime crisis?
#####
Trump is actually a TERRIBLE debater, he only ever got to debate like what.. Ted Cruz? Jeb Bush? Hillary Clinton? If he had to debate Bernie Sanders or even Liz freaking Warren they would have exposed just how much of a dipshit he is.
Andrew Yang would have run circles around him, no wonder he doesn't want to debate in the 2020 elections.
#####
$1000 monthly handouts eh? Very, very fishy.
#####
He‚Äôs different from most Democrats if u ask me
#####
Raise base income will lead to inflation. The rich arent giving up their money and it's going to be the middle class that suffers.
#####
Andrew "magic 1000 bucks a month outta nowhere (totally not from your own tax money)" Yang. I bet he will fix the us-china relations. Maybe americans should elect a russian or north korean president in the future too?
#####
I want to see Yang V.S. Trump so bad!!!!!
#####
MAGA vs MATH
#####
How does andrew yang feel about trump, I just wanna know if he hates them or not
#####
trump may no be perfect but THANK GOD hilary  lost.

but i have to admit this guy is doing his homework.
#####
Probably the last Democrat out there who isn‚Äôt a total nut job
#####
If I was smart enough for you Andrew Yang I would put your face on the $1000 dollar bill.
#####
When every time I drive to the mall all the Trump supporters were hella racist at us.
#####
What I like about Andrew is that he's laser-focused on the problems that got Trump elected. We've automated away 4 million jobs in the swing states that Trump won, and automation will take another 1 in 3 US jobs by 2030. Truck drivers, cashiers, office clerks, fast food & call center workers are all at risk. For this reason, he attracts voters from across the aisle that other candidates don't appeal to, while still working toward progressive goals.
#####
There isn't a Democrat worth voting for. Yang is one of the 1percent that supposedly democrat s hate.
#####
Yang=millennials 
Trump=boomers
#####
No one is perfect but Yang seems pretty damn close
#####
You need to be educated to understand this man but the majority are not
#####
Fuck you Andrew Yang Who is peanut thousand dollars a month you stupid fuck
#####
Manny Pacquiao vs Ricky Hatton!
#####
democrats make all this shit sound so easy how are they going to randomly get all this money to give $1000 to families, tax the rich a fuck ton isn‚Äôt going to work
#####
The media is trying to silence Yang so I wonder why Trump hasn‚Äôt mentioned him yet either- maybe even Trump knows that this man actually has a chance to win if he gets enough people to pay attention
#####
Yang would absolutely nail Trump into the ground. Trump would try to say "You want to give away money" and Yang would say its a divident and capitalism where you don't start at zero. DId you start at zero Mr. President or did you get some money from your dad? More than $1000 a month?"
#####
My family‚Äôs and my vote is going to yang
#####
Trump 2020
#####
Man the Democrats better not fuck this up
#####
Honestly, I feel Republican is more willing to give him a chance than democrats. DNC don't give him time to talk. They try to squeeze him out of the debates all the time. It is hilarious. They would change rules to make it harder for him. When DNC called Republican racists, they don't look at themselves. At least make it a little fair....not just blatantly unfair. People aren't stupid. Both Republican and democrats can see his minutes of talk time. He actually has good ideas.
#####
this man is wayyyyyyyyy smarter than Donnie and Donnie would crawl out the door with his orange face turning red!
#####
The real factor is not that a few thousand in a few swing states decide the election but why our blue States so overwhelmingly voting democratic and if that's even honest totalge and not rigged
#####
Yang speaks with fork kang tongue  when he says a lot of people who voted for trump are tired of trump. Most people are tired of the lies and the hate from the mainstream media and hacks of the Democratic Party as trump faces the same harsh brutal bias attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in his 4 terms
#####
One must wonder if Andrew solution is weak and I think most Americans would rather have strong jobs and the things that were in the fifties and sixties before neo liberalism allow the exportation of our jobs to Mr. Yang's China. Nowhere does Andrew Yang say that the global trade system nice be smashed and he would be happy with any quality and many people just getting $1000 a month while the Chanel bag  And Armani suit crowd continues as they were
#####
Give everyone 1k a month . No he's giving 10 families 1k a month . All these headlines keep saying every person . It's like 0.0000000000000001 percent of the population that will "win" this money . THERE IS NOT A WAY TO GIVE EVERY PERSON A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH . WHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM ? YANG DOESNT HAVE AN ANSWER BECAUSE ITS IMPOSSIBLE . YANG VOTERS  WAKE UP LOL
#####
Let's give all the homeless and crack addicts who don't do shit $1000 a month to waste on drugs :)
#####
Once again , what's his qualification ? He's just like one of those internet political commentators
#####
Blaming Hillary's failures on 'Russian interference is pathetic, lazy and baseless. Why not attack her points? Or even her unlikeable personality?
#####
We will support Andrew Yang till the very end

Want bet Yang will not trade tax liabilities wit Bezos   ???????  If you are dumb enough to think Amazon pays no tax ! Yang is full of brainwashed shit!  I am amazed how many suckers swallow this bullshit!
#####
Trump would kill this idiot with facts!  The Yang plan is nothing but an inflation mill that keeps generating cost that is passed back to you!  Your free thousand would be gone before you get your first check!  And others would charge more just because you can now pay more! This plan is nothing but STUPID LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO HAPPEN!  And some suckers willing to swallow this bullshit!

Next we get Yang on Getting Doug with High üëç
#####
1. Anyone that still believes the Russian interfered with the election and doesn't know about the fisa report and docea that it was fake! Is stupid.2.best economy in 50 yrs more blacks people working! 3. The wall is for us a to stop paying for illegal medical and welfare to non USA. People .and keep our jobs! 4.China tariffs gave us 16 BILLION dollars which much went to our farmers. Oh my over 8,000 pedos child abuse freaks arrested under team Trump. Disclosure of all the corruption. 
So giving 1,000 per person is nice..and stop auto robots is great but thars all you got and firmly still listening to MSM for your facts!!! Really??? MSM takes tidbits out of context and says Trump is racist and a bully..oh my.get the real facts people. Sleep Joe is sleepy Joe. An idiot is an idiot. Trump has more woman on his staff btw.

#####
This is the *ONLY* Democrat I will vote for in 2020.  It's either Yang or Trump for me.
#####
Yang is too smart to be President.  The two political gangs traditionally present the two dumbest, stupidest people they can find for the people to vote for, and their candidates must be people of the poorest character and criminals.  Yang is none of that, which is why the DemoCROOK party will never nominate him.
#####
Chairman Yang would be a much better insulting nickname with psuedoracist undertones that can be plausibly denied.
#####
America will be united once again for what I can see.
#####
Trump be like, "Only a thousand...I'll give the people 5,000 dollars a month and make Chaiiinah pay for it"


And in November 2020, President Yang will boot the orange twat out of the WH and hopefully have it fumigated.

If it ends up bieng andrew yang vs trump i will vote for him but if its any other democrat im voting for trump

3. The whole $1,000 a month will NEVER happen 
4. Have you checked out his policies fools? Because he has done A lot For usa!

Finally idk who you're talking about that his voters are fed up with him..

LIES LIES LIES,-Same shit, different day!

That was the best thing I have heard from democrts

I already love yang, but I haven‚Äôt heard of H3. They seem really down to earth and honest.
#####
Comrade Yang is racist? Lol these democrats are off their rockers.

Honest opinion - while mr Yang's policies shit on president Trump's in many fields, Trump would still 'win' any eventual 1v1 debate for the same reason professional wrestling has an audience greater than actual wrestling. xD

I LOVE YOU AMERICA ‚ù§Ô∏èüíï 
Murica!! Fk yeah!!! 
All jokes aside I'm from India but I fucking love this guy, if I were American I'd vote for him. He's literally the best/most logical freaking presidential candidate in the democratic world, I seriously hope he sets a trend in politics of actual smart people running for president!
P.S I've never voted in my life because every candidate to run for PM/prez has been an idiot. Not just in India but literally in every democratic country.

Social democracy  is the only way to go forward

Wouldn't UBI compell illegal immigrants to get into the US knowing they would receive free handouts? Fix border policy first.

At the very end he says ‚Äúnice.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt agree more to yangs statement just prior
#####
Andrew Yang I would love for you to be my President. It's too bad I live in America at that will never happen.
#####
I want to support yang, but I still can't rap my head around the Universal basic income policy he is proposing. Its just one of those things i have to see in action before i can fully support it.
#####
So what about inflation ? He never answered the question (not in this video)
#####
Did Yang just try to blame Russia AGAIN my god Democrat‚Äôs get over it you put forth a toxic candidate that‚Äôs why you lost.. perhaps don‚Äôt go far left and you can win in 2020 otherwise it‚Äôs another 4 years of angry tweets and false hope

2:54 Andrew secretly a robot confirmed, maybe working for the lizard people?
#####
Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏

Demorat
#####
4:08 yeah you might wanna think about that formulation. or make it your campagne slogan, i don't know.

Its frustrating but also disheartening to see so many people in the comments talk about the unlikely hood of Yang to suceed and basically saying how they‚Äôve given in to the establishment instead of actually considering what he says. Remember that Yang has said many times that he just wants people to listen at the very least, unlike many politicians who feel its do or die, he thinks that he will still achieve a victory in bringing these issues and his ideas to the forefront of discussion, wether he wins the nomination or presidency himself, which is admirable in itself
#####
That dude couldn't debate me, much less the Don
#####
I did the math and it comes out to over 2 trillion per year doesn‚Äôt sound like a great plan to give people 1000$ a year

I was all for andrew until he showed how little he new about guns. When the founders were alive they new about automatic weapons, yet they still didnt limit the citizen from having them. And they also siad that people were aloud to have canon. Especially private ships. Smh

I still belive that if you arnt a women then you cant argue for pro-life. And if you dont know amything about guns you should make yourself look like a fool.
#####
It's not a gun problem.  It's a mental health and drug problem in this country.
#####
Change your stance on this yang and I‚Äôll vote for you
#####
Yang is a very admirable misinformed guy. I like his drive, don‚Äôt like his path.
#####
I really feel like he understands my and my family‚Äôs perspective and reality.
#####
Public shootings aren‚Äôt happening with automatic weapons, like what Andrew is said. Also, when it was written the guns they had were the same as the government‚Äôs. So today we should have less restrictions on the guns we have.
#####
Can‚Äôt do a buy back. The government never sold them to you.
#####
Oh that's the guy that is going to tax me 1 thousand dollars a year to give me 1 thousand dollars a year.
#####
"red flag laws" while seconds after saying needed obvious safety measures sheesh.
#####
People didn't live as long as they do now? Ben Franklin was 84 when he died, was he and the rest of the framers freaks of nature since they lived a long time?
#####
Andrew yang is a fucktard. I didn't see muskets in the second amendment wording. Free speech shouldn't exist on the internet because we only wrote with quill and inks when Constitution was written, they couldn't imagine computers and electricity.
#####
I would ask, doesn‚Äôt someone like Beto who goes from we won‚Äôt take away guns to ‚Äúhell yeah I will‚Äù. How can we trust that this isn‚Äôt a slippery slope? I can easily see Yang say we won‚Äôt take away, but what about the next guy or the following guy who decides to remove another law. Where do we know we will stop and how do we know it‚Äôll end at a certain point?
#####
I actually came here after watching "Darkness - Eminem". Go figure!
#####
I'm glad he even came on the podcast, it shows a sense of transparency and knowledge to the younger generations influence on the internet
#####
Just an AK-47 is all it took to win in the Vietnam war
#####
We need a tier gun system in the United States. 

"Your AK isnt gonna make a difference" -Ethan, yeah no gotta disagree

We need changes but we must not consider mass confiscations as a choice.
#####
That man is amazing. He has a real project to better his country.
#####
Wait. Why is americans having guns dark? Why does that scare you yang? Shouldnt the criminals having guns and the normal folk not having guns to protect from said criminals scare you?
You should have a goal, a simple non political one. Keep guns out of the hands of criminals and in the hands of law abiding citizens.
#####
I lole Andrew but he clearly never heard have the pickle gun. There were also cannons and grenades. If you think the founding fathers wouldn't of developed automatic weapons that we have now if they could, you're high
#####
5 words = SSRI Drugs
#####
People seem to forget the primary purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to prevent the government from taking full control over everything, if you look at totalitarian governments across the history of the world for example Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. People were restricted from having firearms because they could resist against the control of the tyrannical regime.
#####
This is still really vague. Yes, there are 300 million+ guns in America. If we put a ban on "high capacity" magazines, who would follow it? The person who has already obtained 2, 30 round mags ducktaped together? The shooter thats about to go kill his classmates, or do a drive by? Is he gonna chose a 20 round magazine over a 50 round drum to obey the law? Another thing, automatic fire isn't realistic for killing a large group of people, and it should be legal. Automatic fire is something fun to use on the range. The police don't use automatic, the military doesnt, nobody does. Because it's impossible to keep your sight picture on a target.
#####
All politicians need to stay out of the 2nd amendment end of story. There is no debating rights
#####
Criminals aren‚Äôt going to turn their guns in, whats the point of a buyback program?
#####
Australia is 32 million and they have the same amount of shootings we have because we have 400 millions
#####
Wasn‚Äôt this the same guy who said if he was elected he‚Äôd give every American 1,000 dollars a month?
#####
16:20 ‚ÄúWell you have to see the intent at the time.‚Äù Then proceeds to misinterpret the amendment. They stated ‚Äúarms‚Äù not just guns or knives. They meant what they said and how they said it. It is naive to think that these people that mulled over every word of our founding documents just happened to have a vague sense of the 2nd most important amendment. It‚Äôs clearly written then and now.

To answer the follow up question, yes it was perfectly legal for a private citizen to own a cannon at that time. Most people didn‚Äôt own one because it wasn‚Äôt practical, and most people knew how to use most forms of arms and had a healthy respect for them.
#####
It's great this channel has Yang on but fuck at least they should have prepared some intelligent conversations. The questions being asked are grade school level.
#####
I think the most important thing in eliminating gun violence is cooperation. Nobody on the right or left thinks it‚Äôs ok. If people sat down and worked together I think we could eventually find a reasonable solution that lets people keep their guns, and stops gun violence.
#####
Yes they were allowed to have cannons and any other military weapons
#####
Dozen of people being shot is how most wars have been fought for freedom against others who want control over that freedom. Give me a dem who loves real freedom over fake sense of safety please.
#####
Yang is a moron... Because Grandpa sells his single shot, shotgun to finance his next fishing trip... That would really stop killing.. same with more background checks, they can't even do the ones we have now. Let's give everybody free money, the market won't adjust for that üôÑ
#####
1000 a month is going to make what welfare did lazy alcoholic drug addicts. Now a worker who loose his job because of automation. Like truck drivers and manufacturers, hell yes and  paid as a work compensation from the same company.
#####
Red flag....
#####
Why not just lower taxes...
#####
Why would I participate in a gov. Gun buy back when I could just sell it to a gun shop or individual? Politicians make me sick.
#####
How exactly do you think that the founding fathers could not see that guns would evolve just like anything else? Come on üòÇ obviously gun technology is going to advance.
#####
Sorry guys. Its the decay of civilization.
#####
‚ÄúGive people $1,000 a month‚Äù is another term for buying votes
#####
The only people who will sell there guns to the gov are the people that won't shoot up a school
#####
2.5 million defensive gun uses in the USA every year. That‚Äôs reason enough to not ban guns.
#####
I'm so happy that I can go from watching crazy scooter people to economical discussions on the same channel
#####
You do realize once they take your guns your fucked right.
#####
Yang supporter, but his stance on guns is fucked. Other than background checks and similar things, but otherwise he's off base.
#####
this dudes eyebrows haha
#####
300 plus firearms in the US. If guns were the problem there would be thousands of murders everyday. If guns were gone tomorrow criminals would find other tools to kill with: knives, axes, hammers, bare hands.
#####
The NRA says that it supports the idea of these laws in general, but opposes the specific versions that have recently passed state legislatures.  The NRA‚Äôs position is:

Anyone subject to an ERPO should have the opportunity to challenge the order with full due-process protections in place.
An order that confiscates firearms should only be granted when a judge makes the determination, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person poses a significant risk of danger to themselves or others.
The judge should concurrently make a determination of whether the person meets the state standard for involuntary commitment.
Whether or not the person meets the state standard for involuntary commitment, the person subject to the ERPO should receive mental-health treatment.
The process should allow firearms to be retained by law-abiding third parties, local law enforcement, or a federally licensed firearms dealer when an individual is ordered to relinquish such firearms.
There should be a mechanism in place for the return of firearms upon termination of an ERPO.
The process should include criminal penalties for those who bring false or frivolous charges.
So far, none of the states that recently passed ERPO laws ‚Äî including California, Oregon, Vermont ‚Äî have met the NRA‚Äôs criteria
#####
Gah
#####
Yeah buy all our guns so you can play with our buttholes at your will fucking nazis
#####
We need to help Andrew Yang to be world leader & not just US president, as now he is the victim of US fake news, hence having distorted world  views. Eg on Xinjiang. Hope he can gain more votes for being more balanced in his worldviews.

‚ÄúShall not be infringed‚Äù what part of that do you not get? the fact you have your right to bare arms is this exact reason. so no government can make you or your family a slave. by giving up this right you give up your own safety as a society.look back to ww2 the first thing that happens is the guns get taken.then free speech.and then your puppets to commit horrible atrocities at the sake of someone else‚Äôs dark desire.
#####
Because not enough people shoot back!
#####
When I was in highschool, we had a bomb threat and got locked down and had to stay at school after hours
#####
Despite popular belief:
- you're still an American if you don't own a gun
- We will not become slaves if they take away our guns
- Other countries aren't in bondage because they don't have guns
- We as a whole are not safer because we have guns
- Knifes aren't as deadly as guns
- We have many more deaths by guns than any other advanced nation.

I'm not anti-gun. I am however anti-lies and misinformation.  If you have to put a spin on something to make sense of it then you're most likely justifying your ideals.
#####
Why aren‚Äôt public schools protected as much as banks are?, The life of the youth is the most valuable thing. Even if there were guns and bombs in the country, Schools should be protected and secured enough to stop them at the outer walls... this will create separation from their parents which will create anxiety especially with the level of pedophilia, but there should be a walk in, see your kid at any time, check in, go through screening, see your kid through a mirror wall or camera 

Even on your phone you should be able to see what your kid is doing
#####
AUSTRALIA YEAAHHH mate
#####
To answer your question Ethan, yes citizens at that time were allowed to own cannons. And in fact had ships fully armed at that time(to protect against pirates mostly) but at that time those ships could lay waist to a coastal city if it wanted to.
#####
Morons!  Why do these shootings happen? Guns..... clearly not dumbasses!!
#####
While I do support the second amendment and what people want it to stand for, there are a few things to consider. There seems to be a basic misunderstanding about the second amendment regarding the militia. 
The Constitution is to be taken as a literal document. It means what it says. 2nd Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. While this is a rather nice read, it does not say who those persons are other than the militia. So what does it say? 
A large number of people will take a stand and say something along the lines of, ‚Äúthe right of THE PEOPLE to KEEP and BEAR arms is pretty simple language.‚Äù While that does seem true, taking one part of a sentence out of context to make a point about its entirety is negligent at best. 
Looking at the second amendment as a whole and adding some direction for comprehension it means; "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms" is for the purpose of providing for the "security of a free State" through "a well-regulated Militia" who is made up of "the people" to perform the function of providing the security of a free state, ‚Äúthe right‚Äù to do so, "shall not be infringed." Yep, you can have your armed militia to maintain your state's security.
Who is the Militia? 10 USC Chapter 12 defines the militia quite plainly.
 a)The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. 
b)The classes of the militia are‚Äî 
(1)the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and 
(2)the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia. 
This is the point where people need to exercise caution. The Second Amendment doesn't provide the right to bear arms to all the people, only those who meet certain criteria AS DEFINED BY THE US CODES. There are limitations based on age, sex, national affiliation, as well as active military service history. I am not saying the Amendment is wrong. I am saying you have to consider the rest of the governing laws that apply.
10 USC Chapter 12 Defines what a legal militia is, whereas the constitution does not. And therein lies the problem.
For example, 10 USC Chapter 12 prevents males over the age of 45, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, from this right as well as citizen females that are not members of the national guard and non-citizen females. Women who are part of the unorganized militia are not afforded the same right to bear arms as those who are part of the National Guard.
32 USC Code 313 (a)To be eligible for original enlistment in the National Guard, a person must be at least 17 years of age and under 45, or under 64 years of age and a former member of the Regular Army, Regular Navy, Regular Air Force, or Regular Marine Corps. To be eligible for reenlistment, a person must be under 64 years of age.
There are a number of things within our Constitution that are not expressly defined. What is a State? What is a militia? Who are the people? While our forefathers kind of assumed a basic understanding of the language of the time, our government has elected to define some select parts with the US CODEs that can change the overall meaning of the original intention. This is where there is room for debate.

For example, US Code could redefine what a State is or the meaning of the word free. It could go from what we currently understand a free State to be into something completely different. 
The US Constitution is what it is. Our problem doesn‚Äôt lie with the words as they were written but in the manipulation of the undefined through the application of ‚ÄúDefining Codes.‚Äù
AGAIN, I support the Second Amendment and what most Americans wish it was. However, our reality is a bit different.  
The more you know.
---Just my two cents.
#####
Just because a lot of Americans don't understand their 2a right does mean I want to give up mine
#####
I really do love to see a lot of level-headed Americans in the comment section defend the 2nd Amendment.
#####
I dont own a gun and I am a USMC vet but a shotgun can do more damage then and AK-47. So it is propaganda, the founders predicted the government could go against the people so that is why the 2nd amendment is there for the citizens to protect themselves from the government. I know there is a plan called Operation Greenhouse which is the government abilities to turn on the citizens so go ahead let them take peoples guns and see how oppressive this country gets.
#####
I wonder if the Alt-right considers Ethan and Hila "good Juize" for interviewing Mr. Yang.
#####
U.S citizen in the year 2500: Its our right to own a MOAB and the government can‚Äôt take it away
#####
He failed to mention the breakdown of culture, families and no fathers in the home. Most of the shooters were dad deprived and on psychotropic drugs. If you give people 1k a month that cant budget money you're pissing in the wind.
#####
17:12 on cost the dude my vote....never heard dumber statements...."joe rogan says".....really?......
#####
I was all for andrew until he showed how little he new about guns. When the founders were alive they new about automatic weapons, yet they still didnt limit the citizen from having them. And they also siad that people were aloud to have canon. Especially private ships. Smh
#####
Sigh. Presidential candidates should ignore this issue and leave it to the lobbyist. Just quickly explain it doesnt matter what you think because any change would have to come from a congressional change and people should pay more attention to the lobbyist represenative relationship then asking me what I think.

Good candidates blow 50 percent of their vote talking about something THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.

Im very pro gun and I love Yang thats why I make this point - say by some lovely miracle hes elected, he has literally nothing to do with this besides rhetoric.

Its a lot like abortion - when people woth money and power get caught with their pants down they yell GUNS or ABORTION and we argue with eachother like morons while they rob my child
#####
Na na na, we (I) ain't doin this red flag shit. Nor am I ever gonna comply with "universal background checks" the word "universal" means a ton. It means the only way to know where every gun is at all times means a registration. I'm not doin that shit. On top of that 70,000 Americans move every day. That means we would have to have an office that would record the transfer of guns from one address to the next, na fuck this. #MolonLabe 

Edit: I like yang and most of what he says. However when this comes up and you are not on the side of the people, you sir have lost my vote a long ways back.
#####
Lots of idiots in the comments







wait I‚Äôm in the comments
#####
These shootings are never done by responsible gun owners lol
#####
Andrew Yang's plan for gun control is a voluntary solution many gun owners can get behind. Imprinted guns, so only registered users you can use your gun for free and a buy back program, because Americans need to be able to sell guns from personal inventory.
#####
this is the first topic I haven't seen people fully support him on
#####
He‚Äôs a good person if would be cool if he was president and it worked out but he‚Äôs living in a fairy tale

i really love yang he  seems so cool but atm it feels like hes just the new meme politician that GP wont take seriously and that makes me sad coz bernie sanders has been treated like that for years to the point where hes about to drop dead any day now
#####
I do agree that there should be background checks for people with guns. I don't want a person with schizophrenia wielding a firearm. Guns can kill people.

But also, guns can save people. If you have one pointed to a criminal who would've harmed your family, he would most likely freeze in his tracks and you have control of the situation. Just like anything in life, a gun is a tool, just it's a really powerful one. It can be used to protect, and it can be used to kill. It's not the object itself that's the problem, it's the people using it, and if we can ensure it doesn't fall into the hands of people with mental disorders or mal-intent, we can save more people.

Though, it bothers me personally to have it federally checked.
#####
I love how when asked why these mass shootings happen so much now he talks about the guns and how almost every american has one and how Ethan said when he was a kid school shooting drills were unheard of , but when Ethan was a kid all these "bad" guns were still around and i would say that their were more semi autos and full autos, That has nothing to do with why kids are deciding to shoot up their schools, back when fully auto guns were more accessible you didn't see kids in the 70's 80's using full auto machine guns to massacre their schools, I like yang But its a deeper ploy to take guns from us , because once we have none they will tax us to death to pay for all these government welfare programs and we would have no way to rise up like our forefathers intended, They already succeeded in making less equal footing for us and them by banning most full autos in the 80"s but now they are going for semi autos , Beto likes to say we would never win they military has all this power ,but you could have said the same for the colonists facing a armada of British vessels.  we can all agree these shootings are horrible and should never happen, but taking guns away from good people will lead to more deaths than can be fathomed , The problems are deeper but making the individual citizen less capable of defending him self is exactly what the establishment wants and one day if they get their way we become slaves and not realize how it happend , they know they cant just ban them they are taking it piece by piece until its either to late or people stand up,theirs a deeper issue here , why does the same party that enslaved people want to take our  guns away, the mark of a free man is a weapon meaning slaves cant own them people need to educate soon and go deeper into this issue because its scary whats going on. They are using tragedy to limit out rights , The basic fundamentals of this country is never sacrifice freedom for security because those that do deserve neither , we need do a rediscovery of what made this country in the first place and educate, these billionaire politicians have the money and patience to take away our inalienable rights an inch at a time theirs a reason why our country was and is the most free country because our founding fathers know the human nature of man , theirs bad people no matter what and they are in the government as well , these are not privileges they are god given rights that the constitution put out , fight back against Bloomberg and send love to those in Virginia facing tyranny
#####
It's the downers every fucking kid takes because they have depression, ADHD, ADD, anxiety, bipolar, no parents at home, no morals.

Quit blaming an inanimate object to fit your fucking narrative.
#####
There are already background checks, so what more does he want? Just because we have firearms, doesn't make us dark. Furthermore, it doesn't matter how man guns you buy back, criminals will still ALWAYS own guns. The significant majority of gun crimes are committed with a gun that was obtained illegally, so there is nothing you can do about that. Mr. Yang also does not know his history, as the Belton Flintlock was a semi-automatic weapon used during the American Revolutionary War. The U.S. government does not have over 10 million people (and that's only 3% of the population as he states)  in their military, the U.S. government, no matter what, would not be able to enforce tyranny unless they disarm the American populace.
#####
You can not tell me that if you wanted to shoot up a public place that you wouldn‚Äôt target gun free zones... good guys with guns are the ONLY way to stop the bad guy with a gun... law abiding gun citizens are the ones you punish with gun laws not the criminals! It‚Äôs a gun ‚ÄúLAW‚Äù I pay my taxes I follow laws but criminals are CRIMINALS because they don‚Äôt follow laws!! gun laws will NOT solve the problem
#####
How do people still not realize that you already have to get a background check when you buy a gun. No one is against it... it‚Äôs already the law.
#####
Crapitalism will kill you

Like 100% not gonna pass those laws, unless I'm 100% dead and the rifle is pulled from my 100% cold hands.
#####
We already have background checks though...
#####
It makes me really happy that these anti 2nd idiots cause people to buy more guns. Before Obama got elected ar15s were here and there. As soon as he got in office gun sales more than doubled and now my friends and possibly myself own 20+ sporting rifles each and are more likely to buy or build without any paperwork. Trump got elected and gun sale went way down. Now nobody is worried the government is going come take them. They try so hard to abolished the 2nd amendment and all it does is make people stock pile and say "from my cold dead hands".
#####
criminals will definitely follow these gun lawsüòé
#####
Society is depressed and disillusioned from the events of the past 100 years. That's the problem.
#####
Imagine imposing gun laws...
The felons and more will still get their hands in guns, and most law abiding Americans wont be able to protect themselves or their families! Does ANYONE ever consider that?
#####
Only Ethan can interview the future president with a goofy patched together kids blanket with a hoody
#####
I heard "Democratic gun control wouldn't work, but we will do it anyway because of feelings".
#####
DO some people really think guns are the problem? first of all, you CANNOT ban all guns. That is crazy. Second of all, a kid cannot even get a gun unless the grown-ups in the house have them and they just didn't hide it from the kid! it is not like kids go to gun stores every day and buy all guns they want. The third thing is that why nobody ever sees the bigger problem? Why the fuck no one ever asks after these shootings that what went into a child's head and how he was bullied or treated or how was he feeling that he thought shooting up a bunch of people is the only solution? The real fact that no one wants to accept is that  America is a violent country and it should go under research. The problem is in their heads, not the guns they hold. If they can't get their hands on a gun they would pick up a knife or sword and slash some people anyway. IT is like saying they should ban making tall buildings after 9/11.
#####
YANG is a criminal, just like the rest of politicians. A good slave master is still a slave master. He wants to take your rights and freedom, same as the rest. Give $1000/month so he can distract you while they trample the constitution.
#####
Our society has some real problems and they all lead to stress and mental illness. When coupled with a lack of sound examples of how to be a good human being by healthy parents and other solid role models we have a perfect recipe for the troubled people that go on to perform crimes against others, both material and violence. Over the decades and centuries violent crime, and other crime in general, has not actually changed all that much in numbers (per capita). That is key, as obviously the population has gone up tremendously. To be honest I am surprised by this as I see a great deal more troubling people today and a lot more disfunction all around us. Just look at all the street people, the amount of drug usage, etc.. If we have a population of a city go up to 5 times the size it was in some time in the past, it would make sense that the number of murders should also be 5 times as many in a given period of time. Yet those numbers are down. They have gone up slightly just very recently but overall we don't see proportional increases of any great degree. Yet the news agencies speak as though we have epidemic violent crime rates and the people believe it. Yes, it is always too many and we should strive to reduce crime, but by understanding the root causes and working to improve on those. Access to guns has only gone down, everywhere in the US. More and more infringement on the 2A happens every year and yet the problems get worse, not better. Notice I said our problems, not gun involved crime. The liberal's answer is always to pass another law. They also have no appreciation of firearms and see no good to come from them so they think we should just disarm the people and thus they will commit less crime with them. Fewer guns somehow equals fewer shootings by their math formula. Obviously it doesn't work like that or the stats would bare that out. It's their answer to everything. Legislate and spend. It makes them look like they care more if they spend more.

Really understanding humans and dealing with the problems that cause them to make bad decisions and act violently towards others is really hard work and difficult to measure success for the stats come campaign season. What is easy to do and provides them with numbers they can put into graphs and they can spout off stats making them sound really sharp on this stuff is just spending money on programs they support and laws, or "acts", they pass that sound well intended.
#####
This notion that our founding fathers couldn't foresee technological advances in weaponry is ridiculous. Of course they didn't know the specifics but they certainly knew that weapons would advance. They were, in my view, much wiser than we are today. Given that the intent and purpose of the 2A is to prevent a tyrannical govt. (either foreign or domestic) from ruling over the population, their idea was to see to it that the people could repel that tyranny with their own weapons available. They had everything that any active army had anywhere. Just because I can't obtain a Predator drone with optical guided missiles doesn't mean that we should just throw away the 2A and not even try to organize a resistance to such a threat. If a govt., even our own, was to attempt to disarm we the people our own military would be at worst split on it's loyalty to the white house and it's oath to the constitution and the people. When I enlisted I swore to defend the constitution against ALL threats both foreign AND DOMESTIC, and it was within my general orders, which out rank all others, to disobey any unlawful order. My contract with the Army had an expiration date, but my oath did not. I will still defend the 2A and the American citizenry against ALL threats including tyrants that would attempt to amend what was specifically stated SHALL NOT be infringed.

Anti-gunners continue to only see guns as being a threat, and always being carried and used by some psycho going on a rampage at a school. They never see the American gun owner as the law abiding citizen that actually stops that psycho from killing more people, or that deter criminals from perpetrating more crime. The cities in this country that have the worst crime rates also have the strictest gun laws. The difference is only the number of people carrying guns that are not criminals. Good guys with guns do more to prevent crime and apprehend criminals than the police can. That's because the police can only get there after the fact to take a statement from a surviving witness, assuming they will cooperate. Criminals are afraid of two things, dogs and armed and willing to fight civilians.
#####
The founding fathers couldn't forsee automatic weapons??? Yeah well going by that logic they couldn't forsee the fucking internet now could they? Does that mean the 1st amendment shouldnt be applicable to such mediums of communication?!? Get a grip Yang, you claim to be a smart Asian, well you obviously didn't have the smarts to think that one through now did you?!?!
#####
This guy can not win, let him split votes for the DNC

Many demotard voted for Bernie in the general 
Trump had that edge,

Chris Wallis just wanted Yang to feel umcomfortable throughout that interview.  Questions like the polls, questions about his wife were unreal to even ask him, ask him to drop out, I just hope people can see how smart Yang is with his direct, smart answers.  Too bad Chris didn't get the answers he wanted, like seeing some tears when he asked about his wife.  So cruel.

Andrew Wang 8:23 . LOL!!!

This dude Andrew is a joke
#####
Yangang ü§òüèª
#####
Next President Andrew Yang not only has a huge brain, hugely important has a big heart also. In recent history all america voters get nothing but empty promises. With Andrew Yang we as voters get for the first time solid dividend from the country which is long overdue.
#####
He is aiming to keep the average American worker relevant, he knows there's many obstacles people face and why they work jobs being replaced by the technological industry, it's worrisome and he says what millions of Americans have in the back of their minds. Go Yang 2020 all the way!
#####
Can't believe he is treated better here than MSNBC
#####
Elect this man please
#####
Did dude really call him Andrew Wang?
#####
Even if you are a republican. If you want to see more of Yang, register as a democrat, just to make his voice heard. If he doesn't get nominated, just leave again, and vote for Trump in the general election. No harm done.
#####
I cant t beleive I have watched 2 fox related youtube videos in a row and did not find them to be Trump pandering and actually quite impartial and fair . One from T. Carlson and this one.This shows a centrist like A. Yang can unite this country and offers a coherent, reasonable path to America's success. I have been so disappointed with the divisive and toxic politics, beginning with our president, and extending to all the current candidates, including the far left liberals on the Dem side. SO disappointed I had resolved not to vote, recognizing that would lead to another 4 yrs of Trumps dysfunctional LEADERSHIP AND REGRESSIVE STANCE, until I heard this guy speak. I am hopefull now. I can see right and left uniting towards a common ground around this guy. I plan to  vote for Yang this cycle, unfortunately, I still have little hope he can get his message out in time to win the nomination. We are running out of time.
By the way, the freedom dividend IS NOT  another government giveaway. THink of our country as a corporation that we ALL OWN, and that is generating tremendous revenue on the heels of amazing world leading  technological innovation. While at the same time displacing millions of middle income wage jobs. This is our cut from of our countries financial prosperity. It is a dividend yield from OUR OWNERSHIP. Not a government giveaway. THat is why it does not differentiate rich from poor. Every citizen "owner" gets it. It is not a job replacement. Like he said, its  capitalism that does not start with 0$. Go Yang.
#####
I love Yang, but he is not a 2nd Amendment supporter....which is almost a deal-breaker for me.
#####
I think an additional 12k a month could actually help a lot for people who want to work/build a career but, due to the cost of childcare, cant afford to.  I live in Wisconsin and ave child care is around $1000 a month.  My wife is still debating whether she keep her part time job as an junior planner where her take home is $2000ish a month.  I can't imagine what a single mom/dad would do? I can imagine it would be really tough to get ahead if you are basically giving up half (or a decent part of it) your income to be able to work.
#####
0:40 when Harris still had double-digitsüòÇ
#####
i don't know why the 'andrew wang' faux pas was so funny, but it was
#####
I love how some people think everyone is going to get 12k/year and just kick back and retire early üòÇ.  If anything, the threat of LOSING benefits is more of a deterrent to work than saying "Work and better yourself as much as you want. No need to fear that you'll lose this benefit."
#####
Just bring up the fact that Joe Biden has hundreds of child molestation videos on YouTube ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Andrew.... Wang?? Seriously??
#####
Yang2020
#####
I'm a stay at home mom and my husband makes 60k a year (we are a black family just for context) This idea that this will be a handout that people will live on is absurd. We are bearly making ends meet and my husband makes more than the average college grad,  in addition to us just starting a business. With the costs of childcare it just makes sense for me to stay home with my kids.  It's kinda sad that we lump all unemployed people in this stigmatized category. Even if the money went to the lowest of our society don't those same people spend their money in our economy?  So why is that a bad thing if local businesses are being supported in low income areas.  To me the Freedom Dividend will eliminate the social and racial connotations that come with the territory of such debates.  It literally takes care of ALL Americans. I would certainly put this momery toward building my business and securing my ability to homeschool my kids comfortably.  For a poor American this would be extra groceries or payments on a car.  For a rich American this may mean extra money to put toward charity or initiatives at church.  I see benefits across the board.  But I am certainly glad to see a proposal that will help middle class families stabalize.
#####
At least this is 1 Democrat that gives 1 fuk about us
#####
Did he say "Andrew WANG"?.......gg.
#####
Yang is the only person smart enough to beat Trump.  Yang 2020.
#####
Even if Andrew yang made it to presidency, I suspect bezos would put a hit on him or try to take him down via indirect methods, and the american people would just have more money to spend on amazon.
#####
Yall better start putting respect on my guys name. YANG not Wang.
#####
wow... fox news is kind to andrew, but fox would of eat others alive.
#####
Did he say Andrew Wang? Haha

Don't be a wang, vote for Yang!
#####
would someone explain to me how dumbass joe biden is even cosidered for president!!!
#####
This man said wang instead of yang
#####
The 1% is not some big box fortune 500 company. The 1% is that upper-middle class family that lives in your neighborhood.

8:21 "Andrew WANG"
#####
12k and you a
ren't allied to spend it on foreign product's..

When a Democratic candidate gets more screen time on his opponents news channels than his supporting news channels

Did he just Andrew WANG him ?!?!

"The chaos stems from the fact that people have lost their faith and principles. So, to restore order, one must regain the hearts of the people. I will fight cruelty with kindness and injustice with righteousness. It will be HE who will win the hearts of the people will win the world" - Liu Bei

"He who has won the hearts of the people is not far from winning Heaven's favor" - Xu Shu


When I see Andrew Yang, I see someone close to a modern Liu Bei. He had my vote when he said, "It's not left, it's not right, it's FORWARD!" Successful entrepreneurs understand that it's PRAGMATISM. But more importantly, MORAL OR ETHICAL PRAGMATISM.
#####
What makes him think the DNC is going to let him do what he wants.. Its not up to him.. Oboma found that out fast.. He did not want to see Daly Plaza on his travel plans..

Chuck Scarborough, or whoever the geezer is, called him Andrew Wang.
#####
Yang gang  All Day! He makes the most sense and actually has a plan how he can make his agendas happen he‚Äôs not just selling pipe dreams
#####
vote for yang.
#####
A UBI should be acceptable to any honest republican, giving tax money directly to citizens to spend instead of the government wasting it.....
#####
Imagine having $1k to put towards your rent every month. Then the work you do counts for something instead of working just for a place to live and the money you make would go back into the economy as a consumer and also benefiting your children.
#####
Yang crushed it.
#####
"Well I'm Asian, so you know I love to work!" pretty much sum up the entire labor force in Japan
#####
Its either trump Yang for me. Yang problem solving based on human capital mindset is the only outcome i want from trump. Both are right in calling out the truth on the ground, both have good sense of how people are doing, hardship, common values and calling it out as it were. BUT Yang problem solving attributes and approach is what standout for me. It didnt matter if the initial proposal have some minor flaws. You know what, he's bringing us in the right direction away from swamp and really focusing on US, the people. thats good enough for me
#####
He is a clown and a racist
#####
$1000 a month and what people will spend that on 1. Drugs giving more power to bad people. 2. Go and buy something on Amazon witch he is so opposed to 3. Will cropped the economy where people want wont to work anymore. 4 increase taxes to pay for everything and now you don't have that $1000 anymore. What a moron. Go Trump 2020
#####
This video is old.  Yang is Hot
#####
Andrew "Wang" , at least Fox is covering Yang! More these days
#####
I have zero confidence in Andrew Yang. He has no idea about mental health and we shouldn't have someone like Andrew Yang dictate policies in mental illness when him and followers cannot handle criticism. He is ripping on Amazon a company that creates jobs for Americans.
#####
Smart man to go on Fox !  Keep doing Mr. Yang.  You are my candidate.
#####
Yang gangbang more likely. Trump 2020.
#####
I don‚Äôt like trump. I really liked Obama. Yang just puts those two on the playground. He‚Äôs totally on another level

A VAT - counterbalanced by the Freedom Dividend - is not regressive.  And, importantly, VAT is not applied to services.  We must start to value Human Capital and turn away from GDP as the measure of our well-being.  It clearly does not measure our well-being.
#####
He makes some good points
#####
I am constantly surrounded by Trump supporters and hardcore republicans on a daily basis... but every single time I get the chance, I am converting them over to join the Yang Gang, one by one. You can do it too! Yang 2020!!! Not left, not right... FORWARD!!!
#####
He ain't a Wang!!!
#####
Since I'm german and can't vote I'll upvote all yang youtube videos :-)
#####
I like Andrew BUT for someone using the logo MATH, his numbers doesn't add up. Can't afford $1,000 a month for every american and the stats and his answers shows it. More like $500 a month. But Hey, at least he has a better plan at retrieving money than other candidates who just give out handouts using printed federal money.
#####
I‚Äôm a conservative but I respect Andrew for respecting conservative beliefs and not just blaming everything on Trump and bitching about other candidates.
#####
If you want to know which democratic candidate can win a general election, look at the youtube comment sections of Fox News    videos covering specific democratic candidates. People who watch Fox News support Yang as much as people who watch MSNBC or CNN. Conservatives and Liberals both support Yang.
#####
But is America ready for an Asian president?
#####
Liberal SJW‚Äôs: Racism is bad !! Down with all forms of racism !! Empower racial minorities !!
Andrew Yang: I‚Äôm Asian, getting racism, I‚Äôll do Martin Luther King‚Äôs UBI, I will unify all sides 
Liberal SJW‚Äôs: Warren, Biden or Bernie are the best !!
Andrew Yang: ‚Äú.....‚Äù
#####
it's Andrew Yang, not Wang you dumbass.  This interviewer is stupid in this interview.  Too much agenda that clouded his IQ.
#####
Why is fox nicer to him than any liberal or progressive new network..... Scott Santens has a link to all of the media blackout and MSNBC is by far just removing Yang from graphics and Stats and Polls... We all knew media was bias and jaded, but we all thought we knew some were better than others.... turns out they all really do suck.
#####
3 mins in, 
Wallace; ‚ÄúAttack the leaders, it‚Äôs good strategy.‚Äô

#####
That's a pretty empty office back there behind Andrew Yang. Makes sense.
#####
I think in one of his previous interviews he said it's still capitalism except u don't start at zero, one of the best comments I saw was; Even in Monopoly you start the game with $1500.
#####
I'm not American.
I don't live in America. 
And yet, Yang has my vote.
#####
Yang is on to something really GREAT !!!!
#####
Remember to vote in real life and not only in the Youtube Comments
#####
8:23 Did he just call him Andrew "Wang?" lmao
#####
Andrew Yang is calm, respectful, intelligent and professional. Love this MATH guy ‚ù§
#####
"Give you less if you do better" enough said
#####
Wang
#####
Watch out for phony Yang Gang 'I used to be a Republican', or 'I voted for Trump' messages.  Here's just one story on how they operate:  "But the results, of course, were the outcome of a manipulation campaign by Yang fans, orchestrated by a chat group that‚Äôs home to a devout, extremely online contingent of supporters of the entrepreneur turned¬†universal basic income¬†backer. Together, they‚Äôve built out a robust digital operation designed to influence conversations about Yang‚Äîone that seems unrivaled by any grassroots effort pushing other, far-higher polling candidates."¬†¬†@t Mother Jones is not exactly conservative, where this is from.¬† They're easy to spot.
#####
"Andrew ...Wang"
#####
Andrew wangüòÇüòÇ. In all seriousness this guy is the real deal, he is basically saying that the American people know what they want better than the government.  If everyone actually listened to him I think he could get a lot of right wing voters.  I know I‚Äôm really considering him because every other dem doesn‚Äôt understand how the economy works at all and Donald is Donald.
#####
Yang is so pleasant. Great interview!
#####
yang always unites the comment section on conservative platforms. this also happened on ben shapiros show. this is why i am yanggang
#####
Hey Republicans and trump supporter. I know theres a division in this country between left and right but in my honest opinion this is the guy for ALL OF US! Majority of us have the same struggles when it comes to financial security. Vote for him to allow America to Finally Unite for a better cause !! vote for YANG. Lets break the cycle together!!
#####
He has no chance!
#####
Yang really said I'm asian you know I like to work... he wasn't even joking lmao too
#####
Before you go gaga for Yang's $1000 a month, first find out if by accepting it, it cuts into or out your Social security Benefits?
#####
are you all serious here?
#####
I had to make sure this channel was FOX news ( and not a spoof), after looking at the amount to dislike ratio. Yang: @5:53  "truckers likely to punch me in the face if I asked him to go to school to become a coders or engineer. " That conservative mentality , on pretty much every issue, summed up. Foreign policy, unplanned pregnancy, science , environment....
#####
Mark my words, Yang is the best candidate for the next president of  US, period. Yang is a problem solver and thinker, not a global trouble maker, he is a team player and inviting all teams (other nations) to work together in dealing with the future problems that this planet will face! Thank God for Yang!
#####
This is the guy who will take our homeless off the streets.
#####
Bernie or Yang, I don't know.
#####
This debates make now sense if the candidates don‚Äôt get the same air   time. Andrew Wang?
#####
Black Conservatives for Yang!!
#####
Right now if u make more than $1400 a month, u lose food stamp and medicaid. This cap keeps ppl poor. Extra $1000 a month will be more than enough to pay for food and buy a decent medical insurance thru the exchange.
#####
I still couldn't get a crystal clear political stance from him on China's aggression and atrocities (both locally and globally).
#####
The interviewer reminds me of the guy who betrays tony Montana in the motel room w the chainsaw
#####
He sounds like Yang... O.O
#####
Yang spawns will soon seize power across the globe and humanity will be better for it üòÇ
#####
Tired of these anchors trying to make it a fight between people rather than talking about the issues. They bring up AOC like the left brings up Trump. It's all the same garbage. I'm switching to Yang
#####
You give everyone in a circle  1000 dollar each... Say 7 in the circle.   That 7k stays in that circle regardless of who you spend it on in that circle.   Expand that to a community and bam!! Mind blown. You don't have to keep making new currency each year... That bank bail out should have went to the people.
#####
The interviewer was a jackass, good luck mr. Herzog
#####
Fox had no issues with trillions spent on the illegal Iraq War the war in Afghanistan drones bombing 9 countries currently trillions we give over the years to Saudi Arabia and Israel our inflated defense budget which is more than China and Russia combined lol that‚Äôs our tax dollars well spent smh but giving our citizens a freedom divided universal healthcare and tuition free state college is asking too much lol keep selling out to your big corporate donors you clowns!
#####
The host sucks at math... He would know how if he spent 5 minutes looking
#####
Yang recolor?
#####
Hey check out my YangGang2020 tribute video!
#####
He just needs to get better at debating.
#####
The Yang cell is dividing very organically. Good ideas spread like wildfire. Yang 2020! Not left. Not right. FORWARD!
#####
AOC was right! Amazon quietly came to NY anyway without the tax breaks they were pushing for.. She saved the city money.
#####
Lmao why is it so hard for the interviewer to talk about Amazon's 0 taxes.
#####
AY's Republican clone! Hahahaha.
#####
YANG GANG
#####
He could have said yes and still done his pitch.
#####
So a yang duplicate?
#####
Yang is multiplying!!!!! MATH!!!!
#####
Too bad the interviewer can't do the real MATH
#####
Out with the old policy's and in with the new
#####
so people in new york will get $2000 a month if he and yang both win?
#####
New York City does what ever they want and upstate, central, and western New York taxpayers pay for it
#####
Fox News - what a joke. The AOC pics. Screaming distraction and hyper partisan. What a network.
#####
No Yang, No vote!
#####
I cant stand Nadler hes worthless and is no different from the guy who wants his seat
#####
Never vote for a DEMOCRAT or you'll end up with a Communist regime and killed!!
#####
He avoids questions....he won‚Äôt win...
#####
We'll give you money. Vote Democrat. Pretty sad.
#####
He graduated from Harvard. Is that supposed to mean something. The brainwashed idiots that are attending and graduating college these days isn't comforting all. These so called law students are not being taught the LAW only lawlessness and how to get away with breaking the law.
#####
It's immaterial whether amazon goes to New York or not. What's material is they're a trillion dollar company...paying 0 in taxes while displacing retail workers, sucking billions out of the economy and we need to harness some of the gains of this emerging technology to mitigate the drawbacks it will cause...think about it.
#####
Fox anchors interrupting is the most annoying thing ever. Look at the smirk on his face when he keeps interrupting.
#####
Anybody else notice how much Herzog's voice changed between the initial video clip and the live interview?
#####
Seeing more and more candidates run off of Yang's platform! Let's go!!
#####
I saw this movie before, Dumb and Dumber. I was hoping for a viable challenger, he‚Äôs just a far left talking head.
#####
This is the only democratic movement to unseat a corrupt politician. However I will only vote for a republican from this point on.  The Democratic Party has gone too far left and until they can get back down to earth I will not vote for them.
#####
yangs support for after birth abortion is all I care about
#####
I will always give you four thumbs down on any video I can comment on because of the videos that you disable the comments on you suck I have the right to speak this is a public site you should be sued for disabling comments I think I just may do that
#####
This is just worse yang. He says the same things but worse somehowüòÇ. I‚Äôd vote for him but lmao what
#####
Who cares?
He's running as a Dumbocrap!
He is typical Leftist... can't answer a single question from Jason.
Ah, I see, just another deluded Harvard Law twit.
Please... this dullard should be running a hot dog stand and learning some proper math.
#####
F**k Fox, They've been blatantly riding TRUMPs fill in the blank for years. I thought this was an interview not a debate. You grease balls didn't even let him talk. FOX, you are 100% a contributor to why U.S. is such a sad place to be in 2019. If you see this, Fox hasn't displayed their zero respect for the first amendment, yet.. Fox is no better than Antifa right now. You handle things completely wrong.
#####
Good luck to you.  Don‚Äôt go that way follow the trump way.
#####
REPLACING NADLER WITH A BAG OF POTATOES WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT
#####
This guy is as much of a joke as Yang.
#####
That kid is better than Yang himself...
#####
He‚Äôs a fraud!!! Any New Yorker vote for him is like voting for deblasio for president!! Amazon not paying federal taxes has been debunked!!!!
#####
Herzog is probably a candidate of the producers of AOC and the rest of the SKWAD.   aka The Young Turks.  Be AWARE!
#####
Dude can't answer a yes/no question...don't trust that side-tracking nonsense.  Those companies don't pay taxes YET because they experienced years of losses.  Do your research.
#####
Take nadler DOWN
#####
Whatch out! the 2020 Red CYCLONE is coming üëç
#####
I just seen the thumb nail and already made up my mind I'm voting for him !

No medicare for all! Although a rabid rat could beat Nadler. You have to Quit the commie talking points! No one wants your Socialism!  Answer the question!

Nadler is a joke!

Sometimes is not as simple as "Yes" or "No" answer....
#####
No business ever has paid taxes.  Taxes are nothing more than another business expense that gets added to the cost of the product or service they sell.  Which means, specially for national companies, that taxes on businesses is just a way for governments to tax people outside of their district (city, county, state) without the necessity of representing those people in their district (taxation without representation) while making it look like they are not taxing them.
#####
Nadler must go.  He destroys the party.  This guy needs to be smarter.
#####
Since Fox News disabled the Tlaib story - I am going to comment here. Tlaib and the rest of the Squat Bitches need to depart this country with their racist speech and hatred and live on Devil's Island where they can spew their crap without offending anyone but themselves.
#####
People who clearly don‚Äôt understand numbers won‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible because they are to committed to their selfish ways and are closed minded so only thing they see is their own point of view and they are afraid to be challenged on their ideas
#####
Isn‚Äôt it convenient when the only give him 20 secs to answer a complex question? Lmao it‚Äôs not 3 trillion you‚Äôll save money off of people leaving assistance program they‚Äôre already on, Using a Value Added Tax (VAT) to get money from these companies who off shore they‚Äôre profits. Also tax revenue from the extra money that‚Äôs being spent. Just google Andrew Yang and you can read the polices

Nadler should retire.
#####
typical demonrat.. will NOT answer the questions!!!
#####
He's worst than Nadler. He's socialist or worst. Give me a break. We need a republican to save New York. We need a good Republican governor in NY.
#####
Yuk yuk yuk .... that he can't answer a simple question. Such a turn-off. Trump doesn't evade questions. Hits them head on. The political correctness of this staffer is just so weak.
#####
he looks like a jerk and a weasel. He cant answer a simple question what a creep. Communist and a socialist . No way do we need him. he is just as evil as Nadler
#####
This man fully sees Andrew Yangs vision.
#####
Yang is cloning himself.
#####
Which New Yorkers get to pay the insecure New Yorkers $1k each.
#####
We need Yang's lackeys in congress!
#####
Funny how they say company's don't pay federal taxs but ask them how many billions did they pay in state taxs
#####
Kid I hope you can beat the penguin!  The chubby fellow is crafty though!
#####
I love this interview. He is just testing this boy

does jonathan know what happened in regard to aoc and amazon, in new york?
#####
üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé

Nadler will be in prison so I imagine there will be a lot  of people wanting his open
#####
It‚Äôs a simple question with simple answer yes or noüòÇüëç
#####
Good luck with that, douchebag!
#####
Wow he just wants him to talk crap about aoc. Its his interview. Gets his info. Enough of this highschool drama. If you go that route youre just as crappy as cnn
#####
Oooooh i like it. Yangs team is spreading
#####
get rid of career politicians Nadler,
#####
First impression?  Shifty.  Nadler, a nasty corrupt vindictive long term office holder who NEEDS to go.
#####
Why does AOC have to be wrong or right?   He has his own view.  It's not a fight fight.  Good Lord.  smh
#####
Retail?  I thought farm workers were the most needed workers!  The point is, automation will eliminate the lower skilled jobs.  Imagine getting a coffee from a machine instead of a barista.  No price increase and no tip required.  That person can work in the fields!  We need to get off of the Amazon pays zero tax argument,.  Imagine if they were to eliminate 1,000 jobs paying $100,000 per year for every 100 million in taxes. The loss to the economy would be five to ten times more than the lost wages, including wage taxes, cutbacks or closings in supportive businesses, services, discretionary spending,  etc.  Watch what you wish for!
#####
Jonathan's about to crack lol
#####
Humpty Dumpty could beat Nadler in face off
#####
Faux is also fake news and always send Laura and Tucker on 'vacation' when they speak their minds.
#####
Nadler is beyond stupid

He's real good at evading the question.
#####
Giving away something you don‚Äôt own is theft. Good to see this up and comer taking right to his pre-assigned talking points.
#####
Dems adding more communists to the house
#####
If we didn't have a military there would be plenty of money for everything but we must have a military.  Great another closet Marxist. Sorry it's a no go.
#####
GET NADLER OUT!!!   NADLER MUST GO!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
I like young liberals, but why go on Fox News where they are just going to use you for their right wing propaganda?
#####
Can't believe I'am saying this but between these two i prefer nadler he's stupid but this socialist kid is dangerous to our countries survival. All socialist need to be kept out of elected offices nation wide.
#####
Looks like Andrew programmed himself into a robot to prove how awful the automation issue is and run for congress at the same time.
#####
Nadler and the former Andrew Yang staffer should take a trip to Venezuela and check out how well socialism is working out!  Better yet, they should move to Venezuela!
#####
Nadler is disgusting

fps topic >1:10

for me it's the opposite, sometimes when I have played fps games too much I become afraid to play them again because of the thought of just shooting someone.
#####
Fuck yang he wants universal wage head ass
#####
I had questioned Yang‚Äôs ability to lead our military...until I heard that he grew up playing Starcraft. Say no more, fam üëåüèº
#####
Of course he's a fucking protoss player.
#####
Yang the answer is no. What‚Äôs with the jumping around the question?
#####
LMFAO.  NERD. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
#####
Starcraft is my favorite game and youre not getting the guns.
#####
The Asian countries like Pakistan and India are also having teens and adults playing first-person shooter games, but how many school shooting cases ? Almost zero. Blame yourselves for not educating your child. Videogames have nothing to do with that.
#####
Gamers..........  RISE UP.  First gamer president.

Guns don‚Äôt kill people, a bunch of 1s and 0s rendering pixelated graphics do.

If he pledged to make half life 3 I‚Äôd vote Democrat

Fuck the ‚Äúviolence‚Äù. We all know it‚Äôs about controlling yourself. The problem is is your shit together before you turn on that game and the tv
#####
The interviewer is an idiot for the way he frames his questions. So i play ace combat all day, will i become a fucking pilot? This people are fucking dumb.
#####
Blaming violence on games is like blaming AIDS on porn
#####
Its at 666k views rn so video games is a devils advocate
#####
Video games doesn‚Äôt make you violent.

*Lag does.*
#####
I'm a R6s player,  it makes me extremely uncomfortable and sensitive to the cameras on the streets.
#####
Video games are not the cause of any FORM of violence, whatsoever, that's just what Republicans and Conservatives say to scapegoat gun violence instead of blaming the actual weapons.
#####
Video games unit people
#####
Guys I think the reason video games can be a negative thing for people (escapism for hours etc) because there‚Äôs a general population  mental health problem in America nobody even thinks about and I can see it when I play online games and people are just T O X I C and using it as an outlet for violent behavior it‚Äôs deeper than the video games.
#####
I hate this conversation topic, I‚Äôve been told how bad video games are by family, teachers, and other adults for so long and there was absolutely no negative effects on me. I mostly played violent games and have never copied actions I committed in VR in actual reality. Someone who is inspired by a game to commit actual violence is already mental ill and will gain inspiration from anything they play, watch, or read if it motivates their evil thoughts.
#####
nobody who dislikes violence or guns would play a shooter, violent games don't make people violent in 99% of cases, some very young, impressionable children, yes maybe, but for the majority, the game attracts the people who wanna play it
#####

They blame video games because they don't know why these things are happening to begin with. Media scapegoat
#####
Blaming the tools used, typical. Mental health should be #1 priority if you Wang to prevent mass shootings.
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Ok I‚Äôm finally subbing instead of watching random clips. The main guy said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my shit‚Äù when talking about Starcraft.
#####
The thing is, games desensitize us to things, but they don't make us violent. It's actually the opposite. It has been proven that since the creation of video games, violence has decreased immensely and basically became an outlet for the minority of people who do have unchecked rage(not all people who play games have unchecked rage)
#####
He's forcing his answer to keep both sides of his supporters
#####
Over half of American adults play video games... Any candidate with half a brain would stay far away from the ‚Äú video games cause violence‚Äù BS.
#####
Why would you have Yang on your channel? He will make a horrible president.  Unfortunately people actually believe that he will fulfill his bribe of a $1000 a month to the American people. If you think that's a good idea just to to California and start handing out a $1000 to all the homeless because that's basically what's going to happen. Nothing is free. Someone has to pay for it and since you are a millionaire that someone is you.

Love it

Lets vote for him boys

This guy's my favorite USA liberal

It‚Äôs funny even after all the studies showing no linkage, the president decides to say it is a cause of shootings. I play a lot of first person shooters and NEVER had the thought of shooting anybody.
#####
Protoss master class!! Lol
#####
Same therory with violence  on TV when it came out.  Yet we know it doesn't.  It's the same with videos games.
#####
Shit now I kinda like a yang  :\
#####
only dem i‚Äôd consider voting for
#####
Imagine gaming with Yang when he was young as one of his online buddies and 20 years later you hear he's running for president.
#####
Nigga gta got kick to da guns an loud noise dats not realistic?
#####
That's fair
#####
LMAO he needs to be our next president.
#####
Everyone needs a scapegoat to forward their agenda. Problem with blaming gaming for violence is the data is incongruent. There‚Äôs an estimated 164 Million U.s. adult gamers..
#####
Specifically, I think gaming has numbed me to violence in games, TV shows, movies, etc; however, I don't think it has affected my view of real-world violence at all.
#####
Andrew Yang gets its because he is Asian... No joke, Asia has like a billion people and we have 340 million... We have waaay more mass shootings than anywhere else in the world but America, United Kingdom and Asia have LOTS of gamers so clearly he understands that gun violence caused by games is pure bullshit.
#####
This is not the issue of video games but the society itself.
#####
Violent video games is an excuse bought by people who have never held a controller before in their life. Gun control is a solution bought by people who have never held a gun before in their life. Mental health is a problem no one wants to address because being kind to a horrible person is hard, and it is only something you can solve with your own actions, there is easy no political solution.
#####
Trump is going to destroy whichever loser the dnc picks to be their pathetic joke of a nominee.

Bernie is an old man who just had a heart attack and admits to being a pathetic socialist. Trump wouldn't even have to show up at the debates and crazy bernie would still get owned even more than crooked hillary! Haha!!

Sometimes i wish i was old enough to vote

Ok I'm voting for Yang

Andrew could be a good vice president for Bernie!üòÄ
#####
these, people have very little of knowledge of video games. I play video games and I know I can be violent but video games aren‚Äôt the issue, is the abuse of parents that they put there there children. abuse is the issue not the video games or the guns or whatever with your stupidity.

if people are reading this I‚Äôm not abusive in a way that I can‚Äôt have a that I can‚Äôt have a gun, I know self control I‚Äôm not an idiot that needed my life to depend on the government. we aren‚Äôt build like this, we aren‚Äôt bees we‚Äôre the government dies we all die. We all human beings are god giving right with free will. 


if you people wanna know the true about video games you should watch Adam ruins everything about video games.

The worlds first gamer president won‚Äôt be ace Watkins it‚Äôll be Andrew Yang

Ok this is great president

First gamer president

Imagine finding out the guy you played wow with is running for president.

I like his views aslong as he doesnt ho after the 2A then hes cool with me.

Its not that video games cause violence, they more so desensitize people to violence and view it as normal

I‚Äôve been playing First person shooters since I was 12 (now mid 20s) and NOT ONCE have I EVER thought about committing a violent mass shooting

NOT. GUNNA. HAPPEN. 

You know why? Because I‚Äôm a person with a healthy brain who is educated enough to know better, and was raised in an environment of inclusivity rather than separation and opposition. 

Hurting/Killing innocent people is something I will never consciously choose to do no matter how many games I play and that‚Äôs just the bottom line
#####
To all of you saying Yang can't win or whatever he can if each and every one of you stand together and vote for him if you don't and someone else gets nominated make no mistake they WILL lose to Trump I'm a Trump supporter but I'd be willing to vote Yang over Trump

Protoss player? Hm instant respect not at all like those lame mindless Zerg Players üòÇüòÇ

Mental health is the number one issue. A video game will not inspire you to kill someone, and you will not use a gun to intentionally kill someone unless you have a mental health problem.
#####
Video games are totally different from real life lol.
It's not easy to pull the trigger on somebody on purpose.

a protoss guy I'm voting for him

Video games causing violence and shootings? Has anyone even played uno

For all the comments saying ‚ÄúIf he wins‚Äù. I got a heads up for you guys lol... he won‚Äôt.
#####
Mental health? Nah, that's not to blame! It's a clear fact that videogames... seriously how stupid do you have to be to believe that?? Thankfully this Andrew Yang bloke seems to have common sense.
#####
Why is it always gaming the problem? Why isnt the person that's the problem? Have these media outlets ever considered the idea that the person was struggling or messed up, used video games as a coping mechanism instead of the enabler.

Coolmathsgames.com makes me violent


(Edit)I just realised I linked the website

Still voting for trump

Andrew you make it on my Pierce County vote ballot in 11/?/2020 I'll vote for you

If there was a game that involved me choking ethan. I would down load it quick. Furthermore, games dont make people who they are, guns dont make people who they are, people are crazy and not crazy from the beginning. If games were to blame then we should all stop playing games and stop watching movies and stop the radio. Instead replace it all with a yellow bouncy room with straight jacket on and children's music playing. This will entice those with issues to commit suicide. Ethan = suicide

I think Andrew Yang's a cool guy; a really cool guy, but he's nowhere near Presidential Readiness. If I see this guy new and improved in a couple 4-year segments from now, he might have my vote.

THIS IS INSANITY.  There is way too much GIVE AWAY, ALREADY.   That is the SOCIALIST plan and will result in rampant inflation.
#####
The math on this is very simple.  Despite the devastating cost, let's consider this in an economic model.  It'll take about 6-9 months to start paying out consumers, in which time every single Fortune 500 will have a strategy to get that money back from you.  Then, local and small business will raise their prices.  This "freedom" bull!@#$ UBI really is just universal welfare that will rise costs because that's how economics works.  I'm not an economist, but it's common sense that it cheapens currency and doesn't solve the problem of tying the dollar to real perceived value + work.  

The real solution is to get the government's books in order with the same tax solutions Yang proposes, and then incentivize real competition and new forms of supply.  The problem with this Yang guy is that he encourages consumerism, not the American worker.
#####
Employment rate is incorrect. Its not a reflection of the actual figures as to do otherwise would br inconvient. America is a plutocratic society and everything that is happening now, in particular the media, is to protect that status quo. Its NOT a democracy. The definition of a¬†plutocracy¬†is a political system where the wealthy govern. When the richest people have all of the power in a society and make all of the political decisions.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!

The best plan

Andrew Yang for life.
Humanity first.
#YangGang.
#yanggang2020.
He's got my vote.
#####
Yang brings hope to many. Be ready. Malignant souls (who do not know WHAT they are) will battle it out. They are not about to shift any power. Hope I'm very, very wrong. What minds like this don't see is that they are destroying themselves by attempting to Zero-Sum Game life.
#####
#Yang2020
#####
I like it when I see MSM anchors act like @AndrewYang's #FreedomDividend is a pipe dream but then Yang gives all the answers backed by numbers and facts and they can't even put together one counter argument or ask a deeper question.
#####
It's f*cked up to see American media just ignor him whom has the the most ideas and solutions.
#####
I never donated or volunteered for any political candidate of any type until I researched and learned more and more about Andrew Yang's policy and his vision for our country.  Best of luck Yang2020!
#####
Before you go gag for Yang's $1000 a month, first find out before you accept it does it cut into or out your Social Security Benefits?
#####
He literally said we have to curb the "theft" of our intellectual properties and...HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO IN RETURN! So , the plan is to reward thieves because they dont steal as much from us!! What a clown.
#####
Face the Nation bills itself as a CBS flagship. Maybe they should try harder to live up to that?
#####
My entire families donate the first time in our lives to Yang!!! After 50+ hours watching his policies and speeches! We are composed of software engineers and law firm professionals.
#####
Why does the interviewer sounds like she is on her period and on the attack Yang mode ?
#####
SENIORS ON SOC SEC WONT GET THE $1,000.  PEOPLE ON GOVERNMENT ENTITLEMENTS WILL CHOOSE BETWEEN THE $1,000 OR ENTITLEMENT NOT BOTH. PEOPLE ON SSDI AND SSI WILL ALSO HAVE TO CHOOSE.
#####
Real solutions!
#Yang2020
#####
This guy is the real deal üëç I dare anyone to watch him In a LONG TERM INTERVIEW where complex subjects don‚Äôt have to summed up in short sound bites. Yang2020!!
#####
BTW many Kuwait families get dividend check from what I could tell works for them.
#####
I live in Canada and I wish we had a universal income lol. The only thing we have is called the Child Tax Credit. And if you make less then $48,000 a year you get 500-600 a month to help with the costs of raising a child. I think something like this is much more fair and affordable then giving money to every American over 18. It would be a complete waste of money to throw 12k a year at upper middle class and extremely wealthy individuals who do not need an extra boost. Andrew needs to focus more on this aspect, when he says "everyone" deserves 1k a month I think it makes a lot of people skeptical and wonder why certain people need it.
#####
Margaret using Saudi Arabia as an example LOL
#####
Yang supporters on youtube seem so much more civil and educated.
#####
When are these interviewers going to learn?  You are not going to outsmart or win any arguments with Andrew Yang.  Don't question his policies.  Try to understand his policies and learn from his facts and figures.
#####
Wealth inequality has gotten so bad. For example, CEO compensation has grown 940% since 1978 (source: Economy Policy Institute). UBI will help wealth distribute the bounty among Americans.
#####
1000 oil tax is once per year lol and theres like 10 people who live in Alaska.
#####
Amazon is just doing what the law says it can do in regards to taxes lol
#####
Give out $1000/month with whose money; it is  unclear.  Seriously,  i prefer to earn it by having plenty of good paying  job opportunity in a growing economy instead  of hand out.
#####
I do agree that people will actually work more. Not "harder" but more efficiently. People will see more personal time off but their work they do do will be worth more work than people do today.
#####
The question and concern I have about this UBI policy: do billionaires also get $1,000 a month? Will we not just have across the board inflation where the rich are still rich and the poor are still poor in comparison to the rest of the country, just not to the world? We have people in this country that own far more than most people can even conceptualize; why are they included in this $1,000 a month UBI when they aren't paying taxes? It's not going to create a system of equity. I don't know how you do this without the price of consumer goods going up. The other problem I have with this candidate: is he promising anything else? I'm very skeptical about voting for a candidate who has ONE policy proposal.
#####
He made a huge point that underlies his understanding of Chinese people and society.  Namely, he mentioned we need to have a way for them to ‚Äúsave face‚Äù.  That is huge for the Chinese and the complete opposite of what Trump is doing.  You can accomplish much more by working together and absolutely nothing when you demand and brow beat the Chinese into submission.  It doesn‚Äôt work as 1) the Chinese are proud people and 2) they will not be humiliated (lose face).
#####
HA! Look at Andy take her toxic interviewing style and turn every question into a win!
#####
Sign a free trade deal
#####
I hate communists, Yang is a traitor. "SAVE FACE" we are Americans, not Chinese dude!  I agree about Amazon being job thieving converting your job into an Amazon business related truck driver.  10% Amazon tax is too high and leads to recession WHY because you have to tax everybody doing internet trading 10%. That kills the economy.  $1000 is just drugs money for the unemployed and devalues money so that accommodation prices increase double in California - that is why people are leaving.  You need to earn $50 per hour just to survive in LA and if you get sick - the clock ticks and in no time you are on skid row, that is how bad it is. SOCIALISM!
-
#####
He looks and sounds like he is just regurgitating points fed to him by people more powerful than him.
#####
This is not a decision to be made lightly. This money should not go to just anyone over the age of 18. How is this going to affect the purchasing of illegal drugs? How many 18 year old drug addicts are going to be spending this monthly check on drugs? Then ask how long a parent will be able to stay home with their kid. I'll go one further, the alcoholic that lives down the street will spend all his on more alcohol. Will this make Americans dependent on the government? Maybe a slogan that says "live clean, keep the green". Cheesy,but you get the idea. I definitely think that this should be an option for taxpayers only. I think this candidate has some great ideas but putting that much money in the hands of a teen is a BAD idea. Putting that resource into any habitual drug user or dealers hand is a bad idea. If people can easily buy it they will make and sell more of it. Illegal gambling will go through the roof to. You think we take advantage of our natural resources now? Watch how fast the landfills will fill up. We humans have zero restraint when it comes to commodities. How does this not lead to inflation?
#####
Smart guy. The best person for the job IMO. Unfortunately, America is not at that place yet where it will elect an Asian President or a woman. Most Americans now prefer former reality TV hosts, former actors, misogynists, bigots, racists, hegemonists, bullies, narcissists, idiots, and the illiterate as their presidents.
#####
You‚Äôve got my vote!

where has a VAT worked?


did you do any homework before this interview? literally all of Europe.
#####
Wow, the moderator sounds really dumb.. I would not have watched the show if it was not for Yang..
#####
Is she too old or too white to be so arrogant and dumb at the same time .  People like her are ruining America!
#####
Margaret Brennan gotta be FIRED !!!
#####
I think he has some good policy points, but he is pretty weak on China. 

Let's just go full tariff, like with what Trump is going for, and irreparably cut ties with China for the foreseeable future. That manufacturing can come to Mexico, so that our neighbor can start to build their economy faster. At this point in time, we will be facing a major economic slowdown, which will require us to take a hard look at ourselves and reform our economy. We will have to do away with superfluous institutions and cut away the fat from the inefficient ones. We may decide to go all New Deal with a revived CCC and PWA to build out our infrastructure for more high speed transport. Perhaps the biggest change however, will be an overhaul of our educational system to focus more on STEM fields.
#####
Yes 
Todays.A.cover .B
#####
Why is he the only person making sense in the campaign?!
#####
I think this was a great interview. Sure, she came off as a little harsh, but those are the tough questions he needs to be able to answer in order to pull independent and right leaning voters. He did a great job, and I appreciate her not taking it easy on him.
#####
On truck automation, likely it would still require human driver to guide & protect robot drivers. (For example, human is needed for changing a flat tire on a robot truck) 1 driver may drive multiple automated trucks. It could mean more trucks on the road and delivery is less expensive, and even better paid for truck driving, rather than human lose their jobs to machine.

#YangGang
#####
I'm so sick of them asking how it will incentive people to work. I'm not going to stop looking for a job or stop working for 12k a year. What world do these people live in?
#####
That‚Äôs why I like Bernie he tells you specifically what he plans to do policy-wise. You may agree or disagree with him. But All these other politicians try to be smart restating questions and talking about the problems.
#####
So where exactly does the 1000 dollars per person come from?
#####
Andrew needs to explain more clear why the $1000 would not make America lazy.
#####
I‚Äôve seen this block headed hosts terrible listening skills too many times !

If she was my mom I'd be ashamed.

When a candidate can bring the YouTube comment section to civility and cooperation, you know you're in trouble.

Fine example of Modern day racism, low key thinking that u better than them and they r weaker than u. This lady is rude af
#####
NPR took a while to bring Andrew on.  And when they did you can tell they had an agenda which was to punch holes in some of his policies.  This interviewer sounded soooo disinterested in what Andrew had to say.  It was more about let's see if we can trip him up on some controversial issues like China.  Andrew stood his ground and did an excellent job refocusing the dialogue back on solutions for America.
#####
She sounds so rude! And underestimate Andrew.
#####
I don‚Äôt want $1,000 a month if it‚Äôs going to financially cripple my country. He still hasn‚Äôt justified how this terrible policy would be funded. As a black American I‚Äôll be casting my vote for Trump.
#####
It's not going to happen
#####
Yang gang
#####
She reminds me of the grandpa that interviewed him on MSNBC.
#####
Wow this interviewer is a train wreck
#####
This guy is too smart to be president.
#####
I would definitely put money into my business which is surrounded around food  and tech. I just don't have enough with student debt (stem) right now to grow fast enough. We all just want to be happy doing the work we love.
#####
Yang is the best. We won't be lazy with our time but we do have a stake in this country and own stock in this country. Distribute the wealth and let's make a better America. Trust that there is a better way to live and do things, people matter.
#####
Computers are about to take over the railroads too they are already going after our jobs
#####
The problem with 1,000 to everyone is it is tied to your time and they will just devalue the currency. Like when i was a boy $100 was a lot of money now $1000 is a lot of money. They need to give the people more free time. We went from working 12 hour day's and in the industrial revolution we went to 8 hour work day's.
#####
Most Americans are born racists, and I firmly believe that Yang cannot win elections. Although this guy is probably the smartest US presidential candidate in history,  most likely to lead the US back to strength.

As a Chinese, I don't want him to win, because history proves over and over again that the most serious injury to China always always always from Chinese.

The average working American pays about 6-10k a year in taxes, so tell me.....?  Where exactly is the money coming from..?  Sure it sounds great but it's definitely bs.

What Americans should like about Andrew Yang‚Äôs plans for UBI.  The first is the homeless epidemic in our country. With Andrew's UBI, every homeless person over eighteen would be given the ability to rent a place to live resulting in homelessness being over for those adults who use it productively solving a problem this country has struggled with for decades.  This would save millions in resources allowing current available resources to be focused on homeless youth.  This, along with the number of kids that are over eighteen still living with parents that can finally afford to move out, would also result in empty properties in every city being renovated, remodeled and rented as well as new home construction creating thousands of jobs in the real estate, construction and home supply industries.  As well, his plan would dramatically decrease the current number of evictions for renters across America.   The UBI can also be used in multiple ways as a crime deterrent.  For example, if the plan makes it law that anyone convicted of a felony after this becomes policy will be disqualified from receiving the UBI.  Or any person convicted of a crime in the entire country pay an additional tax that would be directly credited to the UBI program.  As well, UBI would provide a desperately needed decrease in the constant stress on our law enforcement, court and prison systems.  Most people would think twice before robbing a store or another person for few hundred dollars if it is going to cost them 12,000.00 dollars a year and 120,000.00 over the next ten years.  Used productively, UBI can not only gives people a reason not to commit a crime, but as well it can eliminate many of the desperate situations that fuel the desire to commit these crimes in the first place.  Another huge problem we have struggled with for decades that this plan would have a huge reduction in is domestic violence.  The UBI would enable thousands of women to get out of abusive relationships that they are currently in because they do not have the resources to leave.  It is a fact, that a large percentage of incidents involving everything from verbal abuse, physical abuse & divorce begin with financial stress.  UBI will almost instantly resolve many of these issues for thousands of households resulting in a dramatic decrease in domestic violence almost overnight saving law enforcement agencies across the country thousands of man hours every night and day.  Another huge problem our country has had for decades that UBI would almost eliminate overnight is child hunger.  No parent or guardian would have an excuse for not providing food to their children receiving the UBI.  The next thing UBI would help is single mothers / fathers and daycare / childcare.  UBI would allow thousands of single parents to pay for childcare that will allow them to find a job provide for their families.  This would also result in a huge increase in jobs in the daycare / childcare industry.  Another thing I want to mention is the auto industry.  UBI would enable thousands or millions to acquire transportation needed to find a job.  This will explode the number of jobs in the auto manufacturing, financing, sales, repair, transport and insurance industries.  Every job created by Andrew‚Äôs plan will be another taxpayer paying taxes.  With that said, I ask anyone looking at the candidates running for President to acknowledge these few facts all humans should be smart enough to know.  NO LIVING THING on this earth from a blade of grass to the President had any choice nor can they change what color they were born, where they were born, who created them, when they were born and in a human‚Äôs case, what they were taught when they were young.  To hate a person only for the color of their skin is hating someone for something they had nothing to do with, no control of and can not change.  NO LIVING THING filled out an application for birth.  With each, and every candidate running for President, please, listen to their words and plans, but ignore their skin color.

It seems like these news organizations are stuck with the perception that people have low attention spans, so for decades, their content has been bite-sized, but if they would observe how millions of people consume information online, they might come to the conclusion that people are just fine with nuanced discussions that are longer than 5 minutes. 

It's a shame, because they fail to inform the people, but moan about the population being misinformed and drawn towards lies. They hate it when the phrase "fake news" is uttered, but do nothing to change the conditions that made such a phrase possible. 



And as many said, it's a shame to see Andrew Yang trying to explain his policies to people that pretend to be curious and impartial, but are just lazy with their lack of research (at best) and frame the facts unfavorably, while just being rude to their guest.
#####
Ok what is that path for China.  I want to like Yang but he needs to answer more than the Amazon issue.  I was not a Trump supporter but I was glad he got elected if for nothing else but to show that the American Dream is true even more so than Obama. Some day my kid could become president.  I‚Äôd be interested in Yang being elected to see if he could do ANY of what he promises.
#####
Good Interview. Good candidate. Lame host. I'd love to see Yang work with Bernie when he becomes president :)
#####
Go yang go
#####
Why does he always sounds like the guy from the future trying to tell people of the shape of things to come and is laughed about all the time.
#####
If the yang-haters and the rich people don't want the freedom dividend, they can either decline it or donate it to cancer research, homeless shelters, orphanages, etc...

I'm glad that Mr. Yang is getting some pushback from the Media.  He needs more of these questions because if/when he wins the Democratic Nomination, he will face Donald Trump and Trump is not going to pull any punches.  Mr. Yang actually needs more interviewers like Ms. Brennan because we need to see if his ideas can withstand POTUS.  In college football parlance, he needs to be battle tested by the media; actuall all the darn Democratic nominees need to go through interviews like this one.


Believe it or not, these kinds of interviews used to be the norm back when the media used to actually hold people in power accountable.  You and I may find it jarring, but that is because the MSM is not doing its darn job, except for these rare instances...

My Commy niece unfriended me on FB who's this guy again?

It's amazing the narrative the media is putting forth. "Won't people just be lazy and not work if they get an extra $1,000." So little faith they have in the people. That's why we're in the mess we're in now.

What would a recession do to the freedom dividend. We know our pensions are tied to the stock market and if it crashes we may lose half or more. Our social security could be cut as well. How would the freedom dividend hold up to crises such as a serious recession???

Yang is my president. I never openly expressed my preferred candidate in the past but I'm proud to announce that this guy has my absolute admiration and support.

Just got the bad news. A trash man Bloomberg jumped out as democrat candidate. That means Yang can not get support from the powerful man of democrat. People of American will beaten down to the floor again by the huge Capital. So awful.

I also just realized he has 287,000 views. No other candidate even comes close except Bernie with 30k.     It‚Äôs an embarrassment that the DNC has written this man off because the people have found their next president. Warren and Biden have like a 1000 views a piece üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôm a 35 year old KY firefighter....this is the only candidate I‚Äôve believed in since turning 18. As a firefighter that rides the ambulance too I see the neglect that befalls seniors and an extra $1000 could be the difference between a decent nursing home and an absolute nightmare. I‚Äôve often wondered when a truly intelligent person would get sick of the lies and run for office and that time has come. Voting Yang2020.üî•üî•üî•

The section about age bias in different industries, especially the technology industry, really hit me hard. My dad worked as an IT since before the .com boom, and yet, because of his age, the only place that would think of hiring him currently are the local education districts. No company that he's applied for wants to hire an over 50 year old man to work on computers and internet, and I could see the mental effect it had on him over the years as he kept getting rejected. I truly hope there will be a way to rectify this to some degree.

tHINK ABOUT A TRICKLE UP ECONOMY...  MONEY GOES UP FROM THE BOTTOM AND 
KEEPS BEING SUCKED UP TO GO UP TO THE TOP.   IF YANG REMOVES AND 
REDISTRIBUTES MONEY FROM THE RICH WIND COMES FROM THE TOP WHO WILL JUST 
RAISE TAXES AND PRICES...   YES YOU GET 1000, OR 2000 OR EVEN 40 DOLLAR 
RAISE OF MINIMUM, MORE ROBOTS WILL REPLACE EVERYONE AND 1000 DOLLARS FOR
 REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WILL ALSO RAISE PRICES ON ALL OF THE ITEMS WE 
BUY IN THE STORE.   the poor people rely on the redistribution of wealth
 ubi... thE MIDDLE CLASS WILL BE HOLLOWED OUT AND BECOME POORER.   yOU 
CAN GET FREE MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT LIKE YANG WHO WILL PROMISE TO 
PIMP YOU OUT AND GIVE YOU A FREE 1000 DOLLARS A MONTH.   THATS REMOVAL 
OF 3 HUNDRED TRILLION EACH MONTH BEING TAXED FROM YOUR FAVORITE 
COMPANIES TO MAKE 1000 TO EACH CITIZEN IN THE USA.   MATH DOES NOT WORK.
  THOMAS PAYNE WAS NOT A FOUNDER OF THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS REALLY JUST 
REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WHERE 1THOUSAND PEOPLE GET 1 DOLLAR A PIECE AND
 HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY ON NEEDED THINGS LIKE MILK AND GROCERIES.  give

How about the fact that these drug companies get help from the government, taxpayer money in order to design these drugs and then once they've designed you would think that we should get a discount because it was our money that helped design that them things. But that's not the way it works. They lack the price way up there( like they were the ones that paid for the design of this drug). It's only in the United States that pays so much too, they ship all across the world at far discounted prices.
#####
It's so nice to get a clear answer and vision to a complex questions. He is providing answers and strategy on very complicated issues that US is facing today. I love this guy.

On the matter of GDP, Yang talks about measuring our health, happiness, etc. instead.  Well, it's not a new idea, Bhutan has been measuring their country Gross National Happiness since 2008, and it's in their Constitution.

You need 15% to get even one delegate. If Yang polled at 10% in every primary election, he would have no delegates at the convention.  At what point would he need to throw in the towel and become a surrogate for Bernie?  Just asking‚Ä¶ He could be Bernie's VP.
#####
Andrew Yang does not present anything new, it's common sense that you cannot fix poverty from taking away from those who have the least. I totally agree we need a lot more humanity all over this glorious world and it should start with governments looking after their own citizens first. Living in the lucky country Australia, I have learnt, just giving money to people does not decrease poverty. Supporting them in being productive with purpose creates more happiness and in turn they make better decisions and poverty starts to decrease. We must put as much importance on agriculture as we do on technology. Society's connection to the land was intimate in days gone by and for good reason. In modern times we have forgotten this fundamental connection because we are insulated by what appears to be abundant food sources that has come from technologies for growing, transporting and storing it. This sad evolution has wiped out peoples understanding that humanity's fundamental dependence on agriculture cannot be overlooked, as it has been. Programs supporting people to reconnect with the land, the importance of farmers, community's and for governing institutions to provide for the health and wellbeing of all will be a huge step forward, a reconnection to our humanity will start being restored. Without nutritional food, a healthy eco system and clean water who cares how much money you make, you can't eat it or power your mind and body with it.

"any politician not addressing it is failing the american people"      -Andrew Yang


I'm going to explain something that most people don't know, and our old, inept, politicians definitely don't know. Technological growth is not linear. It's exponential. That means the rate at which technology is improving is always increasing. What took us from 1900 to 2000 to accomplish could now be accomplished between 2020 and 2040. What took us between 2020 and 2040 to accomplish could then be accomplished between 2040 and 2050. The smarter people and machines become, the faster they grow. The faster they grow, the smarter they become. Got it?  Read that statement again, and think about the implications for a second. This is massive. The human race is undergoing the most aggressive change it has ever known, right now, in this very second. And the reason for that is the rate at which information can be exchanged is the fastest it's ever been, and it's constantly increasing. If you don't think this is going to disrupt a whole shit load of jobs, ways of life, environments, and people, you got another thing coming, because it is. And if we don't get a solid grasp on how to manage this change from a governmental perspective, it's going to be a fucking disaster for average people, and a dream for the rich. I highly suggest we get a president who is at least aware of this. What other 2020 presidential candidate has talked about AI and automation? Who? Zero. Zilch. Nada. They are completely oblivious to the most massive change this country, and this world, has ever seen. UNACCEPTABLE. 
Yang 2020.

24,000 a year for a husband and wife living in their mid to late 60's is a huge boost to what seniors already get in their social security. My mom was born in 1948 and my stepdad was born in 46. She collects SSI and her late husbands social security and my step dad gets a GM pension and his social security, They don't talk about their finances which is commonplace among boomers but I am estimating they bring in a little over 3000 a month. an extra 2000 a month would help them live the last years of their life being comfortable.

IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 



In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Automation should be making our lives easier, not harder. The only way that can happen is if we take control of automation through a VAT and give that money directly to ourselves. We need to stop making ourselves compete against automation and just let automation work for us instead. This is a profound shift in our philosophy as a society. We need to see our well being and flourishing, not our value to the market, as the real value to society. That's the only way automation will work for us. That's the only way we can live in a post scarcity economy.

To who do we turn to in a free society if the market is  plagued with ideals of only Capitalistic instrist and not humanistic interest.  The answer is no one. When the market see you only as part of the mechanics of the industry it is only natural to improve that industry to automation.
#####
Super important to point out his idea of democracy dollars to help wash out lobbyist money!!!! People will mater again to politicians!!
#####
You don't have to ware a tie...his ideas are forward and superior.  He has not taken any money from the billionaires or the Banks like other candidate.  He really has the everyday citizen in mind.  And a lot of the Trump voters i think will see he is going after there problems they face in the American Economy.
#####
Dump Trump!
#####
Andrew Yang has to win...

I voted for Trump the first time I'm not voting for a second time he's destroyed this economy by giving all these corporate handouts which is destroying the real marketplace economy jobs...

I was listening to the faith radio today and they had a News segment at the beginning and they said that Trump said that you have to re-elect them or else the economy's Go to tank and your 401k  are going to take a massive hit..

All Trump is doing is charging things on a on our deficit who's destroying our American Dollar by now actually paying for for thinks he's just charging a lifestyle that doesn't even exist...

Andrew Yang is a true patriot who actually wants to pay for his policies..

Hi Yang Gang Family - I got lucky & found an AWESOME Andrew Yang Song! Let's get it out there. The
Artist even placed subtitles so we can sing along. Very, very addicting! (Pardon that the Composer is bare-chested. A great voice though.)

Free $1000 I am in..man
#####
Yang will get my Vote and I have Not Voted for Anyone in 20 Years.
#####
A tie???? WTF how does that make any difference?
#####
If someone's lack of tie is a big deal to you, you need to immediately quit your job of being a pundit and rethink your values.
#####
I support Yang.
#####
Literally the first Presidential candidate in my lifetime that I actually want to vote FOR.
#####
yang for the Asian people ok
#####
on the matters of substance, the panel has nothing but supportive things to say. and then there's the issue of no tie. i understand older voters might take umbrage with such a seemingly trivial thing, so i hope younger voters will step up
#####
Fox business isn't fox. keep it about business for fuck's sake.
#####
Who could not agree with Andrew Yang and his mantra of humanity comes first?
#####
I'm 57 and have never donated to any presidential candidate, until now. And have NEVER been so hopeful then I do now about our future president Andrew Yang.
#####
*Breaking News:* The Yang administration cuts military budget in half, and gives it to SpaceX. Reach for the stars. Lol
#####
people are struggling to put food on the table and these clowns are still talking about his tie.
#####
"Gotta have a tie"
Well when Trump started, people said "you gotta not be racist, you gotta not be a sexual predator, you gotta not be a total asshol" yet heeeere we are
#####
Gotta wear a tie smh that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important in the world
#####
There trying so hard to just tear this guy smh rich trying to stay rich an stop others from trying to get a leg up

Who cares about a tie

#####
Yang is the 2nd biggest used car salesman on the Dem stage behind Bernie.
#####
I hate ties, they're uncomfortable and make me hot. Let's untie ourselves from these archaic norms and get freed from these 20th century solutions to 21st century problems.
#####
Andrew Yang was right, the talking heads would rather make a big deal because he didn‚Äôt wear a tie versus actually talking about the real issues.
#####
Jobs have been gone! And it‚Äôs gonna be gone soon! Look at blockbusters, Payless Shoes, Charlotte Russe, Wet Seal, Sears, Kmart, malls, taxi cabs, Charming Charlie, Men‚Äôs Wearhouse, Sports Authority, Gander Mountain... those are just the beginning... they were big stores. Automation and AI is already here. People just turn the blind eye. So many manufacturing jobs have been given to robots. This is the future and no politician is addressing it besides Andrew Yang.
#####
Andrew Yang already qualified for the September debate! So I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs not one of the top contenders when he is.
#####
Biden will screw yang over just like  how Hillary screwed Bernie.  Sounds like a good guy but the democRATS won't make him the main candidate.
#####
Yang2020 ! I support Yang and his forward thinking for President in 2020
#####
I guess I won't vote for Yang due to the fact that he doesn't wear a tie. He rather looks like a normal human being.. can't trust the guy...
#####
Is that guy having a stroke?
#####
Interesting how these conservative channels struggle to find footing when talking about Yang. It's clear they haven't done their research yet still just want to fight him because he's running democrat. Since they have nothing to debate with, they resort to talking about his tie. Something he specifically addressed in his recent debates.

They are so far in Trumpland they don't see the bigger picture. So combative they can't reason that his proposals are trying to help all Americans.
#####
looool Non-citizen immigrants triggered! lol ubi only for citizens. haha
#####
Elon Musk been pushing the idea for Universal Income, He definitely was going to support Andrew Yang, it‚Äôs no surprise really if you know about Elon Musk.
#####
‚ÄúYou need to wear a tie‚Äù. Talking heads are still at it. They are only proving Yang right that they don‚Äôt care about the important issues and knit pick over whether he‚Äôs wearing a tie or not. Pathetic
#####
They can‚Äôt criticize anything other than his tie
#####
I hope Andrew Yang becomes the angry asain on stage and flat out curse out everyone on center stage.
#####
Worry about your future not the tie. China already made a hologram to read the news.  They'll find the hottest girl hologram and you're gone
#####
A chinese candidate, and a CEO with business ties to china.
Got it!
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Lost all respect for Yang when you called Trump a white supremacist at the Iowa star fair. He‚Äôs riding the far left train now. He‚Äôs not being real, now he‚Äôs desperate to say anything to get support.
#####
"He's from Silicon Valley"
Seems like this misconception has been persisting for some time. He is from New York and spent most, if not, all of his career in New York. Just because he's asian, knows some people from silicon valley and has a deeper understanding of modern technologies implications on our lives and the future, doesn't mean hes from silicon valley.
#####
Oh boy, here come the smears.
#####
Complaining about his tie is fear hiding as pettiness.
#####
Did anyone else not understand a goddamned word between 0:04 and 0:17
#####
"The opposite of Donald Trump is an asian man who likes math".
Donald Trump wears a long stupid tie.
Therefore Andrew Yang wears no tie!
He's playing 4D Chess!!!

Compared to entitlement programs that have an army of federal employees to conduct means testing and etc., Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend is small government. Receive VAT tax money from giant corporations and give it no questions asked directly to the American people. Yang 2020! FORWARD!

Yang for president 
Gabbard for vise president
#####
America needs a president that's intelligent, compassionate, and a problem solver going forward. Vote for Andrew Yang!
#####
I've lost respect for these FOX Newscast - it seems that they are not sure of what before opening their lips   a few said examples they are not sure of Langs campaign giving out $500 OR $1000 and the other about the tie   come on people don't you read or do a little research before you put yourselves before a camera?  We all know it is $1000 that is proposed and no other and a tie does not prove anything if anything he got clothes on you should be happy about that.  People of Fox this county could use your help not your childish comments regarding individuals trying to make a difference.
#####
Sounds to me they‚Äôre now trying to smear Elon saying things in a way that as if the ‚ÄúAI world‚Äù is imaginary, doesn‚Äôt exist...do not deny science, people. After watching some in-depth podcasts I now find this type of around-the-table ‚Äúnews room‚Äù talk rather ‚Äúfake‚Äù, like everyone has a role and is playing along...maybe that‚Äôs why Trump called it ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, maybe that‚Äôs why Andrew Yang called the presidential debate a reality show...WAKE UP MSM!!!!!
#####
I‚Äôm stuck between Bernie and Yang :/
#####
Huh? People were actually talking about the no-tie fashion. Wow
#####
What if I told you that you dont have to wear a tie.
#####
Okay that reporter isnt very epic
#####
People talking about robots taking jobs, "They are, to some extent." Said by someone who has no idea what he is talking about. Idiots. People who don't understand tech have no place leading our future.
#####
What a joke to be stuck on his tie. God the media is a joke
#####
LMAO the best dogging they can get on Yang is no tie... gtfo fox news... weak.
#####
They said we ain't ready for a black president? Then it happen. Are we ready for an adian president? It migjt happen.
#####
That idea alone would help so many people just live their lives without fear and actually help communities to grow more stable economies. I'm all for this.

There is 330 million people in the United States. That is three hundred thirty billion dollars however it would be less than that because not all of that number is 18 years old. I doubt that there are no cons to this

Why couldn't this $1k be funded through a personal Information tax on giant internet corps like Amazon and Facebook collecting all of our personal¬†data. Obviously this data increases marketability and subsequently revenue as well. A tax figure could come from the estimated difference between sales with/without data.¬†This would inadvertently allow citizens to receive an income in exchange for their personal data. Far fetched?

Milton Friedman endorsed universal basic income? I'm extremely surprised by that. If you don't know, Friedman was a *huge* proponent of a free-market economy with as little intervention as possible. I support universal basic income, but I'm really surprised Friedman supported it as well because it is definitely a form of economic intervention. If someone like Friedman - who was so strongly in favor of minimal government intervention - supports it, then it really gives credit to the idea that something like this is, or is very close to being, a necessity in this economy.

This guy will never be president hes to woke and America's full of idiot voters and people who dont vote
#####
Im pretty conservative but this guy is very smart. It‚Äôs insane how I could never understand Yang with a televised debate but thanks to podcasts I hear his side. Love thesee
#####
I think he'd be the perfect candidate just his stance in the 2nd amendment is a yikes
#####
I haven't watched the video yet but if he really said this, This is the most stupid fucking thing ever! Because 99 percent of the people are consumers these days and with 1000 dollars in their hand, they will give the money back to the rich ass people that own big companies anyway! stupid as fuck!
#####
I vote for China man
#####
Yang gang
#####
yang has my vote now!!! FREEEEEDOM DIVIDEEEEEEEND!!!!!
#####
At first I thought this could never work and what on earth? But after hearing him explain it, it sounds amazing. He‚Äôs definitely right about how it would increase money circulation throughout communities. And on top of that, it would help people who need a little extra help. I make minimum-wage working as a daycare preschool teacher. I love my job because I get to work with kids all day and impact their lives, and the fact of the matter is people with kids have to go to work and so they need daycare services. My job is necessary to the community, but I barely get by. Even just an extra $400 a month would help me immensely. I‚Äôm going to have to do more research, but it sounds like this could really work for a lot of people.
#####
If the government gave every adult $1000 our national saving and GDP would rise, and our country would make the money back eventually as citizens invest their increased free time in learning new skills and experience
#####
We gotta help him grow his outreach to Americans, talking about it with friends or family, sharing this video to them, posting on social media. Any of those things can help. We gotta spread the message to as many people though.
#####
Im unsure what to think of this only because of how people are. Its not that my little broke ass couldnt use an extra thousand a month lol but if this became a thing how would that reflect the cost of living already in place? Already people try to get as much out of you as it is. Knowing your getting that extra thousand how would it be prevented from businesses just raising costs? As with fluctuating delivery fees from utilites so then gouge you for more. If I use in a one room studio last year 10.00 as and example (heat included and dont cook often) why would my bill be double to triple that they would want made up in delivery fee which is costing more then the actual service used?
#####
Yo if I wanted to listen to politicians lie I‚Äôd watch a debate or some shit
#####
People are crazy. I'm so tired of hearing people react to Andrew Yang like this: WHAT! NO WAY DON'T GIVE ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS! WHAT IF POOR PEOPLE GET IT. THE YHAVE TO WOORRRRRK. YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE PEOPLE MONEY WTIHOUT A J0B111!!!! IT'LL ENVER WORK CONGRESS WON'T PASS IT. HOW IS HE GOING TO PAY FOR IT!!!!!?????? HE'S ONLY POL;LIING AT 5 PERCENT. BERNIE SANDERS IS GOING TO GIVE US FREEEE COLLEGEEE
#####
don't get me wrong i hear the idea but didn't this happen with collage so if he does who the fuck is gonna be able to pay rent
#####
üëè VOTE üëè FOR üëè HIM üëè
#####
Nothing is really free.
#####
Hell nah sounds like some bitconnect shit
#####
I'm in support of this guy so far but if you were to start giving everyone $12,000/year wouldn't that just cause inflation or everything in the market to become more expensive? Doesn't add up...
#####
i could listen to this man talk for hours
#####
I need that 1k cuz i olny get 500 a month. XD
#####
What if UBI was based off address(and we tuned the system to track it better) and the cost of living for the area equal to 1000 dollars at the median,  every other year,  adults get the check or we do every other month, 2-3 times a decade etc. At the cost,in part, of the tech companies who will in turn have access to the server/info infrastructure he wants to build
#####
1000 dollars per head and open border right Yang?  Do you see the problem with that
#####
You were great with this one Ethan!
#####
I think also that they should give 1000 dollars a year for children education
#####
So how much is this going to raise our taxes?
#####
I could hike the Sierra and be a clean up person all summer.
#####
I would spend all that on games and consoles.Y'all  trippin
#####
Im 16 and make $10.80 an hour.And work for 4 hours a day because of highschool. I make around $305 a week by working at chick fila (where I live you can get a low end job at 15) I  make  $1,220 a month if the month is 4 weeks long.But on days off of school I work 6 hours so I make $65 a day which would add.$455 for winter break, and spring break too.I make more over the summer so I make alot of money for a 16 year old.My mom makes me give her $300 for rent so that takes away from the amount I get.
#####
the level of respect here is incredible. yang gang gang
#####
they need to take out that cringy fake laugh at first.  start at 44 seconds.
#####
If he gives you $1,000 he'll steal 10,000
#####
No matter what anyone else's opinion is this is our time to help him.
#####
The Plutocrats won't ever allow UBI, M4A to happen, nor will they allow the wars to end. 
Plutocrats: Corporatist Elites won't ever allow their money to be taxed and they'll even kill a president if they feel their dollars are threatened
#####
*I still haven't seen one presidential candidate that has motivated me to go vote. I'm 46 years old and I still won't settle for the imbeciles that run for president every 4 years. Yang...idiot. Biden, Trump, Bush, Obama....they're all useless idiots telling you everything you wanna hear, but do nothing while in office.*
#####
You'll eventually forget easily that he's giving everyone $1000 dollars if you just look up his other policies. My favorite is the Democracy Dollars!
#####
Please vote Yang in your states primary.
#####
not everybody will agree with what Yang is proposing here, but one irrefutable fact that I really think is the heart and soul of his "freedom dividend": Money is worth nothing unless it changes hands.
#####
Yangs weirded out by Hila i think
#####
Im super eager to start up my business and that $1000 a month would go directly to that, itll definately help entrepreneurship
#####
The problem is not being enough work but there sir and ethnicity is insist on having too many kids that more than they need and in essence their work is breeding. I.e.. Mexicans.
#####
Loves his ideas and general down to earth personality. It's refreshing to hear people talk genuinely in politics & putting people first
#####
This is actually not that bad tho, it could also help keep families together as a family together means the money is pooled, giving better incentives to stay together
#####
Dumbest Asian ever or smartest for paying (or allegedly paying) people to vote for him?
#####
It's insane that people don't understand markets or inflation. There is no printing of money. This is a tax. If I taxed Amazon then as the government bought a aircraft carrier.. does that create inflation? 
No. Inflation is from decreasing supply of goods. Or increase the amount of money in circulation. Which only the Federal Reserve can do. This money for the UBI is is already in circulation. No
Just being pushed up from us thru Amazon or Google or Facebook.
#####
There's only one color, and that is green, only one road can make people happy. That road is called Washington Boulevard.
#####
As much as I like him . But it is unrealistic to accomplish $1000 per month .
#####
Instead of a purge we're getting a grand a month?


Perhaps this is the right timeline....
#####
Would y'all believe he stole my idea
#####
You‚Äôre simultaneously assuming the average American will just suddenly become an entrepreneur and innovator. Most people are just going to fucking exist and stagnate and eventually develop depression
#####
Add what is going to stop the greedy landlords from raising the rents of every renter in the U. S. ?  That would cancel out the boost of UBI.
#####
Where is this money going to come from?

Does anybody get a weird vibe from him? Or is it just me..

The Freedom Dividend should not be counted as income for loans or leases. 
That should prevent housing costs and rental costs from increasing.
#####
Where is this money coming from?
#####
i hate how they act like the rich are bad. do some hard work to start your own company, then become successful. no matter how hard you‚Äôve worked, you‚Äôll get hate
#####
great, all prices for everything will raise. hopefully this idiot doesn‚Äôt become president

All the dislikes are trump supporters
#####
The homeless will not be able ro receive the full $1000. Who else will he zero out?
#####
Can't wait for the next $2000 iPhone
#####
I think this is a good idea, but I think the age to receive universal income should be 25
#####
FYI poor people don't think UBI is anything but necessary and a long time coming.
#####
But we aren't going to 100% rid capitalism and that seems like the inevitable outcome to this.. Because when 1000$ then equals 0- and then you give people 2,000$ and then that becomes 0.. so on so forth- in the end it will eventually all equal 0. Meaning 1,000$ could eventually be like 1$ in our country. And I like the idea, but containing the currency and money coming in and being spent, and then there's more counterfeit. etc. 
I would love 1,000$ a month, and it brings in more people to our country, hopefully legally-  it does help a lot but for only so long. People will monopolize as people do. That's my worry. No matter how you verbally paint it, that is what will happen.
#####
Dude is retarded, if you get an extra $1000 a month, all the landlords in the country are going to raise rent to $1200 a month.
#####
The only thing that worries me about UBI is the potential for a future government to use it to manipulate a domesticated population. EX: Take this implantable chip or you can't get your "freedom dividend".
#####
Yes, Russia already does this but with your entire salary not a small booster. Let's not follow that example. If your not blowing your money or pumping out kids before you're ready you can most likely afford to live barring extreme circumstances. If you stock shelves at Walmart you probably shouldn't be eating out every night and buying a new car. People now adays can't live within their means. This excludes college debt of course, that has just gotten outrageous
#####

Gettin a extra grand a month would help me get a better job I work my ass off at a shitty job
#####
Please please please let UBI be a thing

I believe if this happened... success would sky rocket..because everyone can follow there dream instead of wasting life on working all the time
#####
what about those who would  buy crack  beer and hookers  with your 1000 dollars ?
#####
He's not gonna win, Trump 2020
#####
This is genius. I'm sick of living in a world where you need to kill yourself mentally in a horrible job you don't want and are wasted on just in order to be able to have a roof over your head. It's no way to live. With this, people can actually take their time, gather themselves, and pursue a career in what they want the most even if at first its going slow or not earning you enough to pay rent. That extra support is right there. 

I'm not American so I'm of course totally outside-looking-in to this but I hope this dude wins, he seems to have a really good head on his shoulders and this economic model should become the norm in as many countries as possible all over the world.
Understandably, economy/capitalism makes the world go around... We need to work to have a home, put food on the table, and be able to buy the shit we desire but there's a lot that's really wrong with the way we're living. 'Cause it just doesn't FEEL like living.. It's like a game of pressure where you never win, you just exhaust yourself to get by and stay away from homelessness and misery.

#Yanggang
#####
$1,000 a month would immensely help people anywhere in America. I get it's more expensive to live in big cities but this could be play money. In bigger cities if you have 1 million people all getting $1,000 a month to put back into the economy. That adds up just as much as if it's a town of 1,000 people.
#####
Asians are smart 
Also Adrew yang = vote for me I will give you money lol
#####
This universal basic income needs to work similarlry to how we have something similar here in the UK. What needs to happen is that you only get this income when you're unemployed and you have to show evidence that you're looking for jobs. You got to a job centre or whatever you have in the US and the job centre provide you with an email address you can use to apply for jobs and they have access to that so they can monitor whether you're applying or not. There should be something in place where, it's if you're not applying to a certain number of jobs then you don't get your cheque
#####
Australia used to have a government like this go watch friendlyjordies (not my chanel)

I voted for Trump and if he don't run again ille definitely join the yang gang

Getting rid of the guns is not the answer

I don't like Andrew Yang and sure as hell won't be voting for him. I'm Trump all the way but he's being treated poorly by the media and he shouldn't be. It's all rigged. Fuck the media they're liars
#####
Yang gang 2020
#####
The best candidate
#####
I wanna see him again on the podcast
#####
Yang says it will take an outsider to fix the system... Trump is literally an outsider... he still doesn't like Trump... doesn't make sense
#####
Yang is a socialist. 
Yang is a PUSSY 
Yang has nothing but theories and hypothesis
#####
Its crazy how a possible president of the United States went on an H3H3 podcast
#####
Go with honesty. Go with Andrew Yang. Thank you.

As a conservative this man is the best Democrat

She cant tolerate all the gun violence.....good..then vote Republican.
#####
I‚Äôm either voting for Trump or Yang. If any democratic candidate other than Yang gets elected, I will most likely vote for trump. I don‚Äôt like trump very much, but I hate all of the candidates that aren‚Äôt Yang.
#####
The DNC is corrupt and corporate sellouts. The ones who win arent the popular ones but the bought ones and thats why Bernie didnt win the nomination and thats why Trump won
#####
1 thing Trump got right was about fake news. the news networks are all biased and hypocritical
#####
In Europe we have no rights to bear guns. Which is why we have 0 terrorist attacks on children, groups of ppl in concerts, burned churches, attacks and stabbings on pregnant women, killings in Christmas markets, churches, or any other sort of gun violence ..... (said no sane person ever)
#####
Oligarchy. The people are clear about false controls.
#####
We need more outsiders like Yang to shake up the system
#####
As a trump guy, I think yang is the best the democrats have to offer but they don‚Äôt even care about him
#####

I really hope as a community we can all pull together and vote for yang. The fact hes willing to go on so many different shows and podcasts to spread awareness of what he stands for is really compelling to me and shows that hes willing to do what‚Äôs necessary to be understood by us.
#####
Heeeeell yes
#####
How tf did they get Andrew Yang on the show.
#####
Andrew yang is full of shit!! After one of the msnbc debates in the fall he got off stage and did an interview with cnn and said ‚ÄúI miss cnn hosting the debates‚Äù Because msnbc barely gave him time to speak.
#####
Yang should be vice president to Bernie Sanders. And Warren can do house duties in the White house cause women can't be president üòÇ That would be the dream team. Before retards come at me obviously I'm trolling.
#####
Hill can vote now!
#####
I consider myself Republican but I actually like this guy
#####
Im conservative and I CANNOT understand how yang isnt the #1 candidate for the democrats.  HOW DO PEOPLE LIKE BIDEN. WARREN AND SANDERS DO SO WELL when they are basically purely nonsensical but Yang actually can create change because he is reasonable.
#####
I was with ya all the way up till red flag laws.
#####
only reason why I wont vote for yang is because of his freedom dividend policy
#####
He was so very real in this interview. 

I feel like not long after this he fell into repetitious talking points (and how do you not?) but this interview felt very real.
#####
Cans of whip cream.  You can‚Äôt be serious. Whip cream gay talking to rainbow sweater gay.
#####
So a man wearing a rainbow hoodie is now interviewing presidential candidates....America is becoming feminine and weak
#####
The whole news media was rigged against Ron Paul also. They tried to rig it in favor of Hilary by making trump the republican contender but it back fired on her. They couldn't imagine someone who sounds as stupid as trump would win. They underestimated the education level of the average American.
#####
I'm a Trump Supporter but If I had to vote dem, I'd vote for Yang
#####
This guy swears way too much to be POTUS
#####
I think the corporatization of  Parties was the worst thing that happened to American politics.
#####
Stop electing politicians. A politician is only educated on how to gain support and how to pull strings, we need to elect citizens like Yang or Trump because they are businessmen or at the least are not invested in politics, businessmen and women are invested in America being successful not just themselves as they have a business that is reliant on a successful nation, the founding fathers didn‚Äôt want career politicians, they wanted citizens to run the country by the citizens

Who‚Äôs here after the Bernie and Warren fight?
#####
People need to get their information from more than one source try 20+ sources from both party media networks and networks who support different party groups and draw a conclusion.
#####
A YouTuber ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Walk, Run!‚Äù made a video debunking this.
#####
They did
#####
She said she is tired of hearing about gun violence. So, if there was less reporting on it, you would feel safer? Perhaps your feelings on the news are amplified, making the situation seem harsher than it really is, since you do live where it is relayed. For instance, total lives saved civilly through the use of  a firearm should be considered. Although, I do acknowledge the terrible crimes against humanity's wellfare that have been committed with the aid of guns.

Consider, in the end, that rather than emotional reaction, moral analysis and response is the only way to introduce long-standing helpful policy ino the govment.
#####
The fact that he is not a politician means he's a regular person like us. He sees things from our perspective and understands the same problems we as the people go through instead of an old fart politician that talks politic garbage. He identifies real problems and offers real possible solutions. He gets straight to the point. No dancing around.
#####
This is the exact opposite of what we are teaching/helping our youth avoid but yet the big corporations & POTUS are promoting it! Drama = ratings! üò°ü§Ø SO BACKWARDS! Create problems not solve Em! Yang 2020 HUMANITY 1st!!
#####
When Yang debates Doncon, Yang will compliment him and DonCon will just hand over the Presidency.  Lol
#####
CNN has since gone a full Uturn on their anti Yanging
#####
Having a Democrat or Republican run Congress or presidency won't prevent shootings, nor will taking guns away from citizens, I can promise you that. Shootings are a symptom of the anger and hatred that is bred from the tribalism between these political extremes and the more Dems try to control guns and suppress gun ownership as well as keep glorifying shooters on TV (which mostly liberal media does), the cycle will surely continue. Also, it's a result of mental illness which has been steadily on the rise for years probably due to social media and rage bait and the way the internet seems good at making people angry. 

That last thing you want is a country where criminals know its citizens are not allowed to be armed. Crime will sky rocket. It's just common sense. I don't know the exact right solutions but more stringent background checks is most definitely a start.
#####
They just don‚Äôt want him heard because he makes too much sense. He would eliminate so much of this bullshit rhetoric we see on major news channels. No controversy no viewers. His campaign isn‚Äôt solely based on bashing trump he actually has ideas and solutions. Hila is right! He isn‚Äôt hot  enough for ratings; he‚Äôs just way too pragmatic. 

People wake up! Inform yourself!
#####
Bruh everyone tries to hate on this dude but there is literally nothing about his personality, ideologies, openneess, or smart game plan for the presidency that can make you hate him. It‚Äôs incredible because he doesn‚Äôt act like a politician. All the other presidential candidates seem so fake (except Bernie tbh), this guy seem genuine.
#####
He‚Äôs has the personality of a republican but the policy‚Äôs of a socialist üßê
#####
He was a complete unknown to me months ago, but he has slowly grown on me - and this podcast appearance has only reaffirmed it. As it stands now, he or Bernie are my choices. Funded BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE. Time to end establishment politics.
#####
How could anybody not like Andrew Yang?
#####
We've been pointing out the corruption for ages and have not seen a change. It seems like all you have to do is acknowledge it, say it's bad, and leave it at that and go back to business as usual. This creates a lot of disengagement. Yang has been the first candidate that stood out to me with a solution to this problem (democracy dollars) essentially watering down the corporate hold.

This dude sounds good but power corrupts everyone. Don‚Äôt be fooled
#####
I hope he gets elected. We need people who care about solving problems above party affiliation, and we really need people in politics who genuinely care about people. 

After I graduated with my degree, I developed and was diagnosed with a painful condition that leaves me bedridden much if the year. Unfortunately, because I am young, I do not qualify for disability, no matter how severe my condition is or what my doctor affirmed. I have about 2k left to my name and that's it, I'll have no choice but to opt-out. 

Too late for people like me, but I hope he gets elected and medicare for all and the freedom dividends are implementing policies, but I'm far too pessimistic after being ground down to nothing by the "American Way".

The free money monthly thing is Andrew literally bribing voters ......

#####
Everyone PLEASEEEEEEEE register to vote. This man needs to be in office. Idk about the $1000 a month thing. But I'm a huge fan. #yanggang
#####
It sucks that labels hold back a lot of voters. By labels I mean democrat and republican. 
So many people vote party lines it‚Äôs ridiculous. 
We are on a pendulum. Obama was one extreme side and then caused trump on the other side. We need someone much more neutral like Yang or else we will get the extreme on the other side which is not healthy for the future of this country. 

Just my 2c
#####
Man, at this point, I fear for this persons life.
#####
It‚Äôs an obvious statement. What‚Äôs profound is that he‚Äôs saying it out loud
#####
He seems like a good guy, but he's got no chance 1 vs 1 with trump.
#####
Yang is a liberal trump.  Politicians are on the outs, business leaders will run the usa
#####
I watch ur entire u tube commercials and click to the website to support u
#####
I'm a Bernie guy but Yang is easily my second choice. It was interesting because his criticisms of Bernie Sanders were intelligent and thoughtful instead of "SOCIALISM BAD" and I actually kind of agreed with his critique.

I kind of agree with the freedom dividend over universal college because higher education is getting less and less valuable.
#####
No... you are an anyone but Trump mindset person.

Yang... is accepting donations, what‚Äôs different than Trump? Oh yeah Trump was Rich before he decided to run.... so he is less likely to be swayed by money.... I‚Äôm sure Yang could be bought, everyone has a price... except, Trump has everything that could be offered to sway or control him... so he‚Äôs gonna do what he sees fit.

Yang needs to warn the media that even their job will be automated. This will knock some sense into them
#####
Yang is too smart to be our president. I pray that he will be our future president. I feel like he cares about me and my fellow citizens. I live check by check and he is the only person who realized that. If i do receive 1000 a month that be stress free for me. I can pay my son college tuition. I cannot even buy anything for myself anymore. My check goes to bills then food. My boys will be next priority.

Yang.  You cant hold back progress just because some guy has a truck payment to make.
#####
Americans need to realize that they are the reason for the shops going out of business.

They placed the orders with Amazon from the comfort of their own homes rather than drive down town and spend their money in the local economy.

They are the main reason that the shops closed and now their children have no place to work over the summer.

Stop blamming Amazon.
#####
Andrew Yang you are wrong!

We did not automate away 4 million manufacturing jobs.

Economists have been misreading the statistics.¬† A new study proves this.

https://qz.com/1269172/the-epic-mistake-about-manufacturing-thats-cost-americans-millions-of-jobs/

"Foreign competition, not automation, was behind the stunning loss in factory jobs."

NOT AUTOMATION

Read the entire article.¬† 

The first half is a recap of the misconceptions expressed by Yang and many others.






"There are also observable signs that automation wasn‚Äôt to blame. Consider the shuttering of some 78,000 manufacturing plants between 2000 and 2014, a 22% drop. 

This is odd given that robots, like humans, have to work somewhere. 

Then there‚Äôs the fact that there simply aren‚Äôt that many robots in US factories, compared with other advanced economies."

Yangs entire campaign is build upon a lie.

"So when Trump won the presidential election, the true-blue data believers dismissed his victory as the triumph of rhetoric over fact. His supporters had succumbed to a nativist tale with cartoon villains like ‚Äúcheating China‚Äù and a shadowy cabal of Rust Belt-razing ‚Äúglobalists.‚Äù

But it turns out that Trump‚Äôs story of US manufacturing decline was much closer to being right than the story of technological progress being spun in Washington, New York, and Cambridge."
#####
Please watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJNws8XOAKQ. All Andrew's claims about truck automation were debunked in this video.
#####
I support Andrew.  The best WWE wrestler at bringing out heat from a crowd, Chris Jericho,  supports Yang.
#####
Just to be clear, as he didn't have time to go into detail here: 


1. Robot trucks are already on the road in a few places out west, Nevada most notably. 


2. For the first few years robot trucks will have a driver as a "navigator". This driver will also help drive the first 1-10 miles, navigating complex city traffic, parking the freight, where robots cannot (yet). Plus they will help assist administrative things, paperwork, fueling, etc. This will start to really happen and be common by about 2025. 


3. Soon after, one skilled truck driver will navigate 3-4 trucks at the same time on long hauls. The biggest hurdle to this was supposed to be government approval. But as of October 2018, the federal government gave the okay. 


4. Concurrently, truck stops will change the way they operate. They will change into hubs for "gig worker" truck drivers, who sit and wait for the robot truck to show up, then manually drive the last 1-10 miles or so to park it (as noted above). 


5. After about a decade or so, there will be very few live truck drivers as the gig drivers who park the trucks are replaced as automatic robot trucks and technology solve the last piece of the puzzle and are able to navigate city traffic, and park themselves. This may happen as soon as 2030, or take as long as 2040, but it's coming. The hurdle won't be technology, but cost of replacement as part of a ROI analysis to a business. Getting the old trucks off the road, and new ones running. 


This same sequence applies to many other jobs by the way. He mentions retail, but it stretches beyond that. High risk jobs, even jobs in finance that involve bookkeeping, record keeping will slowly have many of their work related tasks taken away, then eventually their job eliminated. Picture a financial planner replaced by an app for example. Scary to some people, but not at all to most people under about 45. 


What jobs are immune? None are truly immune, but most involve human touch, care. Such as nursing, physical therapy, some teaching jobs, some operations jobs. Yes, there will be a higher demand for engineers, coders. But those numbers are not growing nearly as high as people think. If 20-40% of all jobs will be wiped away by automation by about 2035, only 5-8% will be replaced by this kind of tech work. Any and all legitimate studies and research has come to this same conclusion. Anyone can look it up and find it.
#####
The reason why truckers kill most motorists in accidents is cause 9/10 it's a dumbass young teen or person that's late for work who cuts in front of them causing them to slam on their brakes
#####
Andrew Yang is the uniting figure and the problem solver we right now.
#####
Everything is either automated, redesigned to be automated or just completely replaced.  Tesla Model Y for example.  Instead of the 3km of wiring, they redesigned the entire electrical architecture and cut it down to 100 meters!  The remaining wires were redesigned into modules that can be easily installed by robotic arms. 


Auto industry: avg luxury car has 3km of wiring,  so human assembly is required.
Elon Musk: hold my beer.
#####
wait whut?? a presidential candidate in Big Think??!! woooow
#####
God speed, Yang 2020.
#####
Youtubes Candidate, My candidate
#####
The thing about automation is that it can be a force for good. The whole point of the machine is to remove manual labour out of the production process. As machines gradually start doing more and more of the work humans  currently do, the output should be the same or exponentially greater. Work as we know it should becomw obsolete. The machines will carry on doing the work and humans can for once kick back and finally get to live and enjoy life for what it is and take delight in the simple pleasures of life... Goodbye to drudgery and slavery to corporations. But then if the machines "come alive", wouldn't that be something.
#####
Imagine they are already testing out the trucks at night when there are a lot fewer vehicles on the road, and a lot few people on the street.
#####
No because real truck drivers are going to sabotage robot trucks, the will never make it to there destination.
#####
This guys ideas are going to crash the economy.

Can‚Äôt wait to see those automated trucks being hacked lol

Yang missed something.  Autonomous vehicles might still need years to hit the road.  However, it is a reality now in a controlled environment. The seaport was used to be full of workers and drivers to operate containers.  For the past few years, there are more and more fully automated appeared around the world.  So it is no longer a Middle-West problem.  It is becoming a coast-to-coast problem. LA or NY port workers are about to be replaced by AI and robots in no time. Check the following links:

I like how he is able to sum up what are actually very complex ideas into simple, succinct language.
#####
Ok so I've heard this guy talk about the same stuff over and over. I understand automation is killing jobs a lot of us get that. But you haven't given us a solution to fix that at this point your just pointing out problems. Scaring people to vote for but you got no answer Mr. Yang it's a free country what are you gonna do ban robots and technology
#####
Yang lost my vote not just now, but upon his crying facade and calling names to other political people.
I had thought he was different.  Automation is not always right for the community or families.
You know how much donations come from Truck Drivers to the Children‚Äôs Miracle Network because they can afford to give?
We have hubs of people who gather to do good things, automation deadens that.  If you want to cry, cry for killing American culture / tradition.
#####
Here's the reality, speaking from the perspective of a pro truck driver of 15 years.  We are DECADES away from the presence of driverless 18 wheelers on the road.  Having a vehicle that can drive down the highway is one thing.  Having one that can negotiate surface streets in Boston and LA and Chicago is another one entirely.  Ive taken trucks down roads and into places a robot truck simply could not and would not.  These vehicles have a default position of stopping entirely when they come to something they dont understand.  When one of them comes up to an intersection in which it would need to invade several oncoming lanes to be able to successfully negotiate the turn and there is a ton of civilian traffic all over the place, what do you think would happen?  The truck will stop and not move again.  There are turns like that and intersections like that literally everywhere.  The only way to make fully automated trucks a reality would be to refurbish the entire highway system and all of the places goods go into and come out of.  Cool.  It would only cost about 50 trillion dollars.

That isnt to say that automated trucks arent coming.  They are,  just not in the timeframe this guy mentions.  In fact, they are already a thing and ive driven one.  The autopilots on these things are incredibly sophisticated these days.  I drove a new truck for a company last year pulling car parts out of Laredo into northern California for tesla.  Once on the highway and the cruise control set, the radar on the front would automatically adjust the speed to maintain proper following distance.  I only ever really drove the thing on surface streets or in heavy traffic.  It was nice.  

Thats the state of the art at the moment.  Its really hard to envision having 18 wheelers driving with no humans in them any time soon.  Eventually it will happen.   Just not in the next 5 or 10 years.

For the record, im all for it, even if it would mean I'd be out of a job.  Because, frankly, most of the truck drivers I encounter on a daily basis are fucking terrible.  Unprofessional and unsafe.  And that comes from the fact theres such a driver shortage, and has been for years, that they'll let just about anyone have a CDL.  Id estimate that anywhere from 75 to 85 percent of the drivers currently driving on US highways everyday shouldn't be out here, because they don't know what theyre doing.
To that end, I say bring on the robot trucks.
#####
Why will The Don only bring back manufacturing jobs?  Why is no one crying to bring back bank tellers?ü§£
#####
One of the many reasons unions are important. Collective negotiation power against bilion dollar companies.
#####
it seem like he already the president, ive never seen a candidate be everywhere like this..
#####
this will take at least 15 to 20 years with truck driver, but wall street and bank sector will loose about 30% of their work in about 5 years, that is more scary also
#####
First off, truck and other automation will be an economic disaster, second even if it wasn't, fuck the economy! Why would you want to sacrifice peoples lives, jobs and heritage at the alter of capitalism and "progress". People over profits. And robots.
#####
Most people who die in semi-car accidents are caused by the car drivers. They kill themselves. This is what dashcams are proving.

Survival of the fittest in action.
#####
You, and this guy DO NOT WANT AUTOMATED TRUCKS ON THE ROAD.

There is no way to sue a company if the driving is done automatically. 

Plus, you don't want them in inclement weather.
#####
#yang2020
#####
Does he even know that the fully automated semis he's talking about won't be around for a very long time.  At this time, there still  needs to be someone in the cockpit in case there is any failure of the automation.  Someone has to be there for repairs/fueling.  Someone has to be there for loading and unloading.  
I'm all for future tech, but let's be realistic about it.
#####
If they all the manufacturers are all gone, how come they can't get enough people to fill all the open positions??

#####
I fully support #YangGang
#####
It will only benefit the business owner. What is the benefit to the jobless worker? Yang like all Democrats only offer lip service not actual solutions.
#####
The problem wasnt even automation, but rather the designing of it, without the former human operator in mind. Like how can they think a selfdriving tractor, with no human to make sure it drives correctly, is safe travelling across country 100% alone.
#####
Please vote for Andrew Yang
#####
Not to mention the looming driver shortage. A lot of drivers are giving up the trade. It's not a great life.
#####
Yeah, maybe.
But he's running for presidency not CEO os SV.
His tech philantropy is just a plus, yet it is his only argument.
USA is not just SV. 
Still way better than bernie though since he has an idea to explore

#####
wait whut??  A presidential candidate on BIG THINK?!?!?! WOOOOWW
#####
this video is retarded. the posed question was not answered
#####
I respect Andrew Yang but he is wrong in some ways. The problem is, that the main aspects of the economy that have been automated, were otherwise, or will be otherwise, transitioned to China. If we try to de-automate, we will most of the time take money being earned by American companies and send it to China and India. In the instance of trucking... yes... automation will kill American jobs but it is efficient. The solution is that the government needs to finance an unparalleled number of small business grants and loans so ordinary people can try out their own business ideas. That would be hugely successful.  Trying to deautomate or regulate automation will only cause harm. A universal income is creative thinking, but that won't work either, because there are far too many humans who are not altruistic or worthy. They are lazy or criminal or parasitic, and will drag the economy down to its knees. We should give money to people to try out new ideas and build new businesses. That makes sense. Lazy folk shouldn't get a free ride and breed more laziness.

He‚Äôs being fueled by republicans and libertarians mostly and some democrats eventually even more democrats will come to support him as he gets more time on debates and gets huge support from celebrities from social media such as Elon musk last night he‚Äôs going to win
#####
The question in the title wasn't answered - blue collar disaster or economic win? And why does someone casually discussing the destruction of millions of jobs rate a vote in an election for leader of this nation? Did any of you learn anything from 2016? Why is this fait accompli?


Why are you making the assumption that the voices of millions of people can be purchased for $1000 per month, when we know definitively that inequality is a greater driver for unrest and dissatisfaction than poverty? 


Why are you assuming the public will simply eat this $1000 cake, without recognizing it as a blatant attempt to make being poor and disenfranchised more bearable? And just how bearable do you think this will make it?


Universal Basic Income, school debt relief, and the other monetary awards that candidates keep promising are simply attempts to paper over the real structural problems that our nation *cannot* afford to drag into the future. I'm sorry, but people like Andrew Yang are distractions from continuing the important work of devising truly sustainable solutions to those problems.
#####
I'd like to see an auto truck back up to a dock around cars and other obstacles. Also who rings the deliver bell or unloads it?
#####
I don't really think he gave a solution he just highlighted a problem honestly
#####
the sad thing is the other candidates and 80% of congress have zero clue and don't care. The remaining 20% don't understand tech and will take 3-10 years to understand. I work in IT and I've been saying this is going to happen for a few years now. Glad to see a candidate that is actually taking notice and proposing a solution.

I was skeptic about his $1000, and when I found out how MSNBC treated him during the debate... I was thinking... I will vote for this guy. Nope, I'm not a Democrat and Republican. I am a Libertarian. I am looking for logic to vote and Andrew is the most logical guy. His $1000 per person would likely never get passed, but I think he's so logical and factual that he will retract his failed policy and move us back to reality. I'm saying this not because I'm Asian and he's Asian... but we do need someone this logical and factual, even though you may not like his policies.... cos facts and logic rule, and will get us there.

Is he a Chinese spy sent to harm us?!  Looks like it.  No cryin' lyin' needed here, this is a Republic, we're not China commies here.  Just him and his party of demons.

i gotta ask..wth is up with a tom styer video playing at the start of every yang video? thats kinda cheesy imo.
#####
There's not only highway freight trucks though going from warehouse to warehouse.... but that's probably a big chunk. But there is still local freight, forest trucking, rural area trucking and so on.

Scary shiny Andrew Yang...watch out
#####
wow
#####
#YangGang! #Yang2020!
#####
YANG TRUMP 2020= MAGA win.  The power of Trump and the Forward thinking of Yang is a dream team combo.  Need to put parties aside
#####
Please Americans vote for this guy, we NEED someone in the White House that can address the issue of automation, or America will be a third world country very soon and the middle class a thing of the past
#####
Again, automation is now. Here in Vancouver, we have had driverless public transit since 1985.
#####
Might be wishful thinking,  but look at Tesla and autonation there. 

 Technology might be there,  but who's going to insure it.  

Not only that but freight is hauled mostly by owner operators or small companies (up to 20 trucks)  that leaves 10% of all trucks to mega carriers like Prime, Schnider and etc. 

We're not 5 - 10 years away more like 20 years away. 

Plus not 1st time humans experienced massive change.  Everytime there were other jobs and more small business owners.  

At the same time must say Yang is the best candidate from all Democratic candidates, fresh ideas,  not a career politician, but knows how politics work
#####
#Yanggang Andrew has my vote!
#####
Disaster. More people without good paying jobs is NEVER a good thing.
#####
Soon the only job will be finding ways to automate jobs until the jobs are all gone and everyone has access to anything they want. This will advance humanity as the only goal will be valuing human lives and life could be a literal utopia.
#####
It almost looks like somebody from behind is miming his Hand Gestures.



Until he lifted them up.
#####
A robotic society is to serve human, and  not to eliminate human .
Otherwise it is self defeating.
#####
More than 22 thousand people should be watching this video. Share the video people it only takes 2 seconds! Yang 2020
#####
I sure wouldn't want to be driving down the road and see an 18 wheeler pass me by with no driver. They are scary enough with a driver.
#####
Would you trust a human lawyer to review a contract that AI can write and read in seconds?
#####
John Henry type beat
#####
I was listening an episode of the Ark Invest - For Your Innovation Podcast, and a point mentioned about autonomous trucks really startled me. The only place humans are really necessary is the last 1-2 mi. The AI can handle everything i.e. the interstate, and then just stop on the shoulder 2mi before the destination and wait for a human to finish the difficult maneuvering. 
I was expecting 4-5yrs but now I think this is going to happen a lot sooner than I expected.
#####
A Harris ad played before this video. Sure wish ads were directed at Yang and not someone the video isn't about.
#####
Jeff Bezos is a literal villain out of a batman arc
#####
Corporate > Government in reference to strength.
#####
Do the math, there is NO freaken way US can come up with extra 3 trillion dollars that‚Äôs (3000 billion dollars) Every year for this  freedom dividend. 
He is putting smoke up everyones ass knowing most Americans can‚Äôt do math.
#####
I like this interviewer. He asks questions as if he was dumb and didn‚Äôt know anything. He really gets me to learn more than I expected.
#####
How does he find about these schemes? I would like to know how he knows.
#####
I heard they carried over losses and years they didnt make money over to current years. If thats true they should have to pay up really soon. Because theyve had profitable years recently. Dont like things amazon does with taxes and how they treat workers.
#####
That is fraud tho...your saying money was made somewhere it wasn't....
#####
So he is mad someone knows how to game the system legally and make billions and he didn‚Äôt think of the idea first.
#####
Federal government is a joke compared to the technology power houses.
#####
Dividend puts buying power in the hands of Americans. Does more product exist because if it? No. So all the money we make from working is worth less than before. Less incentive to work. That will make less product between us all. So we all end up poorer on average but more equal. This is his big plan.
He could just connect profits to employee pay role, but no. He wants to expand the bureaucracy and give the government power over who eats and who starves. Can't stand Yang.
#####
Looking  at all the political comments, I think we should all live in wood shacks away from each other
#####
@5:10  This is the problem with a VAT, is raises the price that the consumer pays.  So you go to buy something on Amazon and it now costs $50 and they add a VAT, the price is say $55, so you pay more and that $5 goes to the Gov that in turn figures out how to distribute it to lower middle class people.  Let's say the person that gets that is actually the same person that bought a $50 item... they can use that $5 to pay the VAT... which would come back to them after going thru the Gov.


It sounds good on paper, it can be made to sound like a solution that will solve all the world's problems, but in reality, it's just another tax and Amazon can pass that on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.  BTW, if the consumer can't pay the higher prices, they just stop buying.  I didn't by a $1million car last month because I didn't have the money, that's the way it works.  Add a tax to everything and see how many people can afford to buy things.
#####
Kagame predicted this in the show Continuum. The show was waking people up in season 1 so they switched it up and then swiftly canceled it.
#####
That rules has changed here in Ireland. All American companies pay tax in America now. The Irish government will lose billions this year
#####
The IRS has been defunded so much that they don‚Äôt have the manpower to audit the rich and the corporations. Yang is my second choice after Bernie. Elizabeth Warren was my third choice but I am very disappointed with her latest actions with her negative attacks against Bernie which are baseless.
#####
Well the first problem Ethan, is that you live in California.
#####
This guy with Yang is not very business savvy.
#####
Billionaires is one thing. Manipulating politics and monopolies are another. So what's in store for the rest of us.Fuedalism?
#####
say i receive my "freedom dividend" or for that matter the minimum wage goes up to $15/hour..with either scenario the price of goods and services will go up accordingly and the purchase value of the dollar would decrease..i certainly wouldn't be purchasing more tho likely what i do purchase would cost more..at this point i find it hard to endorse any policy that would contribute to further inflation.
#####
America going down the toilet. Knew it was coming.
#####
Apple does it they all do it, Ireland is not innocent in this deal, they create the tax haven to attract this exact sort of behavior.  Lobbying plus loopholes . . .you cannot fault the companies for doing this.  Their obligated to their existence , success and shareholders.  And they pay matching SSN taxes for each US employee.  They collect and pay sales taxes when they sell items.   There are so many different types of taxes, what Amazon does is not illegal . . .
#####
Should have pushed him harder on the VAT. I could tell it made him uneasy.
#####
Breaking out in sweats listening. Our children view some of us as monsters.
#####
Yang reminds me of an Asian Jimmy Carter.
#####
Let‚Äôs go baby üáÆüá™ üíö
#####
Ofcours VAT is paid by the consumer, not by amazon .. lol
#####
Shhhhh leave Ireland alone üáÆüá™
#####
The reason money passes through Ireland is because Ireland has one of the lowest corporate taxes in the world @ 12.5% places like Japan have 40% corporate tax. They don't pay taxes in America but they pay significantly lower taxes in Ireland
#####
I‚Äôm a trump supporter and I will be voting for him, but Andrew Yang is the only democrat I would not mind beating trump just because all of the other democrats are terrible compared to yang
#####
you gotta go after Elon musk more. the man is the biggest corporate welfare whore there is worse is robbing is of our future where it hits us the hardest: transit. transit has always been how to keep wealth stratified blockading access. the man admits to illegally patenting ideas then "getting others toinvent it for him" though MIT "contests" etc

the future is public transit and we need it now yet musk is pushing car culture even harder and destroying our chances of ever evolving past the car based culture.

our entire society is based around cars which is destroying our planet and is killing more people than anything else. he claimed he had a *new idea " called the hyper loop which was just a rehash of pneumatic tube trains but with the attention of destroying our chances of public rapid transit like bullet trains in exchange for a privitised version only available to the rich.
#####
The big companies have convinced a whole segment of our society that they'll have to close if they have to pay taxes. Prices don't have to go up, they pass along increased cost because we let 'em, not because they have to. When we decided to make profit sacrosanct and shareholder dividends the only purpose for business success, we began to build a very destructive myth. Short term gains and the race to millionaire is killing this country. Literally.
#####
Ethan seems a great political interviewer
#####
VAT is paid by the consumer not the company. Unless he only makes these big tech companies pay VAT. business to business transactions are usually Vat exempted for many business. Also amazon has the majority of its revenue for B2C so not sure how this works. Very wishy washy
#####
Yang is worrying on healthcare and Bernie is still the far superior candidate, but yang is very genuine and likeable. It‚Äôs refreshing
#####
So his solution for huge companies not paying taxes is making us the consumers pay more taxes? Wtf? Ffs
#####
He thinks if he becomes president he will be able to stay wholesome. Haha thats why non politicians dont become politicians.
#####
Every question is asked with an answer lmao
#####
not ireland,
but avalon
#####
How about all politicians are taxes 100% on anything they make over their congressional salaries.  They are all multimillionaires when they leave office from a $180k a year job.  No, there isn‚Äôt a corruption problem on all sides.
#####
Andrew Yang would make a great president. Such a good overview of the world around him.
#####
VAT (value added tax) is the FUCKING ANSWER
#####
Mr. Yang's laugh is so cute!
#####
I like Yang. He's like a younger Bernie.
#####
Amazon is just going to pass the cost to the consumer. Hes dodging the wuestion because he knows we know the answer. The way the operate right now they are allowing for such low prices for the consumer. Yang is saying the taxes he will make them pay will go back to the community but in reality the way the government works is they say it will then they take it and redirect it. All politics is BS.
#####
6:16
Suck capitalism
#####
BIG taxes on 'tech' and other corporations...
ipad $600...now $900... sooooo who pays for the increase?


oh, that's right.  The working class.  Just like always.
#####
Yang gang 2020
#####
Andrew yang is a failed business owner now a failed politician. Wonder what he‚Äôs gonna fail at next
#####
‚ÄúAutomating truck driving‚Äù TAKING JOBS FROM PEOPLE QUITE LITERALLY
#####
2:17 yeah it's an expense but it's income to the recipient so either way the tax is paid. You, too, can have a corporation that pays nothing in tax because you'll pay the tax as an individual. I swear Yang's supporters are a bunch of retards.
#####
Why not end these wars ,stop military aid to other countries , stop buying U.N votes with foreign aid.and return us to the gold standard then you dont have over tax businesses and its citizens.
#####
JESUS!! LET THE MAN TALK, FUCKIN INTERRUPTING HIM EVERY 2 SECONDS
#####
cheap energy (subsidized fossil fuels) allows automation/mechanization/concentration of wealth !  pass a carbon tax and human organic labor will be able to compete better with technology- and thus humans will be more valuable, and more of the wealth will have to go toward labor and thus distributed more evenly/fairly.
#####
I like yang, and yang is a perfect example of why we need young people in government. Time to get the fossils out
#####
You can't necessarily get mad when these corporations or individuals do this. If the opportunity is there because the government hasn't or won't address the problem, then why wouldn't you take the advantage?
#####
Y, the truth is VAT tax eventually is being paid by customers, because supplier can(and does) increase their price and that's exactly what's happening. Whenever government taxes with VAT any goods(fuel, food, furniture whatever) companies increase price of that product to reduce VAT impact on their income. There is more money in government pocket but those are money of citizens, not companies :) Hardly a promising solution.
#####
People use Amazon, they could choose not to... and Bezos seems to innovate more than government. He wasn‚Äôt worth 100b 20 years ago,
#####
VAT will be passed onto customers, to say otherwise is egregious. Question for the Yang Gang - if I receive more than $1k a month in welfare and opt-out of the Freedom Dividend how does President Yang improve my quality of life? I'll be getting the same level of benefits, but now I have to pay a VAT? Am I missing something, or would the most vulnerable in society become poorer?
#####
If the democratic party was made up of Andrew Yangs, Republicans would have a fight on their hands.

Fortunately, they don't and kick out any Andrew Yang/Tulsi Gabbard types and go with the crazy unlikable fake candidates.

I dislike Yangs idea's for socialist changes he proposes, especially as someone who's made his money off of the very thing he's complaining about, its as though he's made his money and now wants to stop others from doing the same. However he's worth listening to as someone on the other side, always calm, respectful and willing to engage his idea's to critism.

"His name Jeff"

#####
Fuck taxes
#####
here me out boys:

Maybe if the USA charged amzon the same low tax rates (5-20% area) that the offshore tax havens charged them, then maybe JUST MAYBE amazon would pay the low rate of tax in the USA. then that would be better as the USA gets tax rev from the billionaires. Becasue, they are paying TAX, just not in the USA - but instead in countries with better tax deals. So in fact, maybe cutting taxes will result in an INCREASE in tax revenue for USA
#####
Mr. Yang, your VAT explanation was unclear. Hence, your stance is unclear on taxing tax evading corporations.
#####
Wang is a moron. The difference.is that this podcast isn't employing a MILLION people. They also do not have tons of overhead with warehouses, transportation, etc. Amazon also gets massive tax breaks for bringing jobs and boosting local economies wherever they go. Malls were closing no matter what. The internet is the future.
#####
0% income/corporate tax. Retain consumption tax.
#####
The problem is not that Amazon is doing something like that. The taxes on business are too high and they should be lowered and made simpler so everyone pays them and paying taxes doesn't destroy your chances of being competitive. It is better to have a 12% tax that everyone would pay than to have a 30% tax that everyone wants to evade. The higher the taxes the higher the incentive to evade them.
#####
Why does everyone think they deserve other people‚Äôs money
#####
Jeff Bezos makes $149,000 a minute... üò±

A visual explanation on the Ireland thing. https://youtu.be/EFKGmmm-j5M

He doesn't pay taxes and threatens to pullout of Washington leaving thousands without jobs if challenged
#####
No Andrew - VAT or GST IS played by consumers. Companies do pay but recoup it from consumers. You are technically plain wrong.
#####
Amazon‚Äôs market cap space is NOT $1 trillion. Microsoft is the only company that has a market cap space of $1 trillion.
#####
They pay 0 in taxes because of a loophole during its inception which stated that online shops did not have to pay taxes.
#####
Jeff Bezos is legitimately a movie villain
#####
You should sack your accountant and get a better one
#####
Also, as a person on board with a UBI, how do we prevent someone like a landlord from trying to soak up those UBI dollars in rent? Its all good if I get $1000 per month, but what stops capitalists from increasing their prices to take it? "Virtuous Cycle" wont stop companies without virtue, like Amazon.
#####
Yang is such a charlatan. VAT doesn‚Äôt get any money from Amazon.  It is paid by the consumer not Amazon.  

You can see when Yang is pressed on this he avoids the question and  changes the subject.
#####
"washington chews up and spits out idealists." Exception being Bernie Sanders. This is why he is the man.
#####
Wait wait wait, why do I recognize these hosts? What show???
#####
5:33
Doesn‚Äôt Yang debunk his whole premise by saying Bezos can just raise the price of all products on Amazon by the VAT tax amount to keep their profits unequal and have Americans pay more. You could apply the same principle to UBI, where corporations will factor that extra money into their pricing. I appreciate his ideas and genuine interest though
#####
Wealthy Companies are very powerful and break the fuck out of our democracy to pass laws that benefit them. Hard stop
#####
Zero or u mean millions and billions lol how the fuck was this dickrope a ceo
#####
Large companies like that have thousands of patents. The patents are owned by sister companies in tax havens like Ireland and Cayman Islands. Then the company based in the USA then pays a fee to the sister company for using their patents and shifts revenue/profits to a more tax friendly location.
#####
Well...... The truth is that VAT is paid by the end consumer; not the company. That's how it is in my country anyway.
#####
Andrew Yang obviously campaigning for future elections
#####
FUCK JEFF BEZOS THAT BALD SHITHEAD! I'M ALSO A REPUBLICAN AND LIKE YANG
#####
The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation. Our plan for UBI uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics, leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-Added Tax.

It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability ‚Äì primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn‚Äôt universal basic income, it‚Äôs whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.
#####
How will BUI effect economic inflation? I feel like Yang's plan will just accelerate inflation of the US dollar and we'll be back where we were a decade laterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#####
What about a flat 10% tax
#####
They both needs to shut the fuck up and stop cutting in and let Andrew Yang speaks.
#####
Bernie for prez. Yang for vice.
#####
Andrew Yang is all talk and no action
#####
Get rid of Goods and services taxes and income taxes. The rich aren't paying them anyway. Bring in a Carbon tax not even the rich can avoid that.
#####
Amazon needs to be anti-trusted, not taxed!  They are more than a conglomerate, they are a monopoly.  This is why Yang would make a shit Prez.  Because he doesn't have the guts to say the truth.
#####
"Washington D.C. chews out and spits out idealists" I feel like this happens all over the U.S. especially because no on even knows what a good idealist and bad idealist even is - even outside of government like in a simple workplace or on the streets. American Values are so split and inconsistent amonst the people. Yang2020! liking what hes about so far.
#####
Andrew Yang fell off and he's still pretending he's in the race, lol.
#####
Yang has 160k individual donors while Bernie Sanders has crossed 5 million.
#####
I like his ideas but a VAT tax isn‚Äôt the answer. VAT is mainly paid by the consumer so would not affect Amazon‚Äôs tax rate at all. On top of that, It‚Äôs a Regressive tax that impacts the poor more.
#####
His laugh almost rivals Bush
#####
Put the money directly to the people not Washington DC.  I will vote for Andrew Yang 2020.
#####
This guy will have my first vote!

The one thing that the African American community needs to hear and know, is what will be done about the obvious decades upon decades of racism and prejudice?

Andrew, check out this video, actual UBI in action. Army vets getting lifetime UBI for disability and this is his testimony

https://youtu.be/BfkwwYR4m1U
#####
UBI is unique in that it has no hang-ups on prejudice or rascism as everyone would receive it. - I'm a NZer and I love the idea for spreading small amounts of wealth to those that need it the most without creating barriers or stigma between classes or communities. I think it's an excellent idea and perhaps to be identified as more of a basic human right to receive enough money to cover those basic needs in life - Well done Andrew! The real challenge is to appropriately create the tax revenue to pay for it define that, have those answers and I believe nothing will stop you in 2020 Good luck my friend.

I would encourage people to buy electric bicycles with their Freedom Dividend, and ditch their car(s). If at all possible. There's a lot of reasons for it. But the one reason that might matter the most is that you save a lot of money by not paying gas every week, car repairs, vehicle inspections, new tags, property tax, the occasional speeding or parking ticket, etc. And you'll save money by not having to pay Andrew Yang's proposed tax on gas.

Most people only need to travel 10, maybe 15 miles in any direction in town, to go to work, to a restaurant, bar, movie theater, to go shopping, etc. And a lot of people don't need to travel out of town, or at least have other modes of transportation they can take for that. 

I gave up my car years ago and have been biking around town ever since, in all kinds of weather, from extreme winds, thunderstorms, to snow and ice. I'm currently saving up for an electric fat bike. It has "fat" tires about 4" wide for snow so I'll be ready in the Winter, too. I use a bike now for Winter commutes, but frozen ruts in the street are very dangerous with thinner tires, as they almost knock you off your bike (regardless of ice/snow spikes). The Freedom Dividend could pay for an electric bike in 2 months, but as it is it's going to take me 2 years to save up for one. 

An electric bike has a lot of advantages. You avoid a lot of traffic which can sometimes mean you get to work sooner. You get more exposure to sunlight, which improves health (some doctors say cancer is linked to vitamin D deficiency). You also get the opportunity to be more physically active, especially when you make it part of your routine (i.e. going to work or coming home). An electric bike helps you get over big hills if you're less physically fit, elderly, or maybe you're just really sick that day and don't have the strength to do it. It also helps you maintain a higher average speed. A lot of people also find biking to be more enjoyable and you get more of a connection to where you are and where you're going, and more respect for people on the road.
#####
People who are strong supporters of capitalism like to look down on people who can't make more money for themselves. The higher up you go in the echelons of corporate America, and the more obscenely wealthy people become, the less empathy they have for the average American. And the more dismissive they are of their plight. 

I would argue that the pursuit of liberty and happiness should be the ideal of Americans, not being subservient to an economy whose bottom line is the almighty dollar. Large institutions and corporations don't serve public interests or even stick to their founding principles, because that's not what allows them to survive in the economy.

The economy needs to serve human beings, not the other way around. And a big part of Andrew Yang's policies and principles are behind this, which is why I'm voting for him.
#####
Yay!!!! I'm so glad Yang is Democrat. No one is calling out his idea to buy votes for what it is. Yay!!! Freeeee $$$$$ reeeeee!!!! Vote for him he pay you!!!!! Yay!!! Democracy for democrats.
#####
What's going on yang your not posting anymore

Only a brainwashed idiot would vote for this idiot! he has no plan for anything but stealing! He would inflate our money into Oblivion. All you idiots think the companies won't raise their prices to cover their loss from the theft?? Your thousand would be gone before you got your first dime! He is most likely working for china! I am sure they love his plan to destroy America!
#####
She's the one who won the July 4th drawing right??

Here's a pro tip for his advisers. Ask universities and colleges if you can hold a speech. That way you will attract much bigger crowds like Sanders did. Would be nice if you could post a reply here. Good luck

Okay, I am going to talk to all the Yang gang. Yang is not going to be the candidate in 2020 no matter how much you donate. The dems are terrified of him. He is promoting change, and both the dems and the reps do not want change...they want business as usual.
The ticket will be Biden and Warren. So, how do we get Yang for Pres in 2024. I will tell you, and you will all think I'm nuts but, if the dems win in 2020 with their "business as usual ticket", Yang will never be President and, I am convinced America will fail, our democracy will be over. If you want Yang as Pres(like I said, in 2024) then all you Yang gangers need to vote Trump in 2020. If Trump wins in 2020, then Yang WILL BE PRES in 2024 and he will win by the biggest landslide ever(except for George Washington, but that's a special case). I may get hate mail for this but how I see it is a vote for Trump in 2020 is a vote for Yang in 2024. I am voting dem on every other issue and candidate but if Yang is NOT on the ballot, I am voting Trump(and I didn't even vote for him the 1st time!) But I am biting the bullet. Holding my nose and doing it.
The good news is, if we can swing the Senate to dems, then the 1st issue on the table for the new congress WILL be impeachment. Vote dems for everything else, but, if Yang is NOT on the democratic ticket. Vote Trump. A vote for Trump in 2020 is a vote for Yang in 2024.

Please get Andrew Yang on JKN YouTube channel....would be a huge audience to tap into. Just a suggestion üòä

the 1000 a month will not help the homeless but it will help preventing families living paycheck to paycheck become homeless, it's also reduced crimes these homeless people commit due to lack of money
#####
We could be spending a few billion or trillion and actually end the age of willful alienation we have been enacting on one another.. Amongst the things that could possibly happen, inequality could vanish-, The weight of poverty and indifference could be removed from our collective conscience-,  everybody could fully take part in the system creating greater value, there would be no haves and have-nots only those who have-,  and the Injustice of which poverty creates would possibly vanish-,  economic slavery could finally come to an end-,  or we have found another way that it didn't work. Unless tested we will never know how great and good we as human beings can be‚Ä¶  We talk of the value every life intrinsically represents so if we never act out our truly good collective values then how honorable and righteous have we treated the only value we represent .The value of a person is talked about in all of the founding documents of this great nation one way or another....Today we take the human value and crush the person the value comes from...  We and our environment are one....Take the Human being out of the supportive environment of this planet and the human dies.... People have intrinsic value and if that value is stolen...every person not being allowed to be creative or the actions of those who would limit anybody else's opportunities creates economic and opportunistic slavery making more harm than meets most people's eyes...Homelessness is a symptom of a much deeper and more taboo subject...How should we in the affluent 1st world assign value to the priceless gift of life and how do we treat that priceless gift...after all, our most valuable commodity is not money...it's human beings.  how much is your time worth to you???  Funny how we always seem to want a dollar value there, when in fact our time is priceless....And who has the time to do as they choose???   The masters seem to have that time... Dollars and time  sheets have collared and shackled our fundamentally understood rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness..
            The sad truth of today is everyone is so distracted by their distractions that no one gets to see what's going on. That's a difficult place to get out of.  The communal blind spot is one of the most deadly and vacuous places to have to pull one's life out of.  The weight of indifference and inaction, The constant efforts that get little attention or rest. The only thing that keeps the self going is the need. I speak in the third person not to sound cool but to gain a distance from a very emotional subject that if I reference in the 1st person, it is so overwhelming and out of control, that it becomes impossible to communicate.  
             Communication is connection, and if there is any connection from my perspective then the responsibility I have in it is reflected in the environment I find around me. I see it and wish to point out that the responsibility of that 
environment is everybody's responsibility.  Every person who effects that environment is responsible for the outcome of the aggregate actions that we as a whole enact.  Not just myself in where I have found myself.  If I have a choice I have to know that I have a choice to be able to choose.  That is true for everybody. And if you have no context to understand a choice,then you don't have that choice.
           Argument is a choice; as is not arguing.  Today there are more arguments than ever.  And I find few arguments I agree to because the arguments being voiced are of a quality most questionable.  
            If in making an argument that the homeless are themselves the reason for its existence then I would bring to mind the act of wilful alienation. To make a person an alien all you have to do is learn to see them as ‚Äúother‚Äù and not like self. As a consequence of the acceptance of this argument then the value of that person or persons becomes vacated.  An additional consequence of this is, in extension to the argument of making that person ‚Äòother‚Äô, you can conceive of taking the ‚Äúother's‚Äù value for the self.  I argue that a person who holds this position, of the constructed argument, no longer considers the ‚Äúother‚Äù a person in their mind. This constructed argument is the problem.
          The problem in today's world is not that there is homelessness, it is the fact that as people, we, are willing to use an argument of willful alienation on one an‚Äùother‚Äù then in extension assume the value of that ‚Äúother‚Äù for the personal value of oneself. Given that problematic set of circumstances that we as people act out, the ‚Äúother‚Äù is no longer a person in the perception of the person or persons enacting the argument of willful alienation.

it starts here..... our hearts open to this gift of generosity, seeing this womans life changed, imagine how our hearts will open to the rest of humanity, what if we all gave a portion of our freedom dividend to some else around the world..... neither left nor right but forward... this man will be President of the United States... I'm in.... Yang2020.. !!!

Why the heck is this Chinaman running for President of America? He does know that we aren't going to let him eat our dogs and cats, right? Trump 2020!
#####
I can't believe that there are people who  exist who don't want $1000 every month and say they have no use for that money. Like are you seriously that close minded?
#####
When Andrew is elected, I am going to use the $1000 per month to pay off my mortgage. Then I am going to quit my job. Im going to buy a motorhome and travel around the United States. I may buy a home in the Hamptons or on the California Coast. Maybe plant a vinyard and start making my own designer labeled wine. With the money left over, I will buy a small plane (nothing too fancy) and.... $1000 per month is nothing. You cant pay off your home, quit your job, start a business of any significance. Nothing good comes from money you havent earned and this isnt a life changing sum. Only retards light up over this idea. If you are jumping up and down over Andrew's completely shit idea, then you are the retard sunshine!
#####
Everyone get a landline and register democrat so we can participate in these polls
#####
If the yang-haters and the rich don't need the freedom dividend, they can either decline it or donate it to cancer research, homeless shelters, orphanages,  etc...
#####
I think we are too far away from total automation to make this a reality. Unfortunately, there are plenty of jobs that will not be automated in the next 10 years. I don't think offering 12,000$ a year will change anything, we need re-education and training for jobs that don't exist yet.
#####
Can we make this guy king of the world, he gets everyone

How to show support other than donating for his campaign? What I mean is how can we vote on Poll or get his polling go up?

Sorry but Make America Think Harder is not a winnable slogan..Like it or not, its a media war with Trump and Trump prove Think Harder is not what his voters want..Frankly slogan need to change, go for the throat - America is going into the recession, Trump bankrupt his own casino and cannot save America.

Why doesn't this channel do uploads anymore?

please emphasize the claim: 1000$ per month maybe not mean too much for rich, but it dramatically save people troubled with poverty

Shouldn't have called the President of the United States a "fat slob" and challenged a 70-year old man to a pushup contest. Really? Come on man, some people liked you because you were above all of that. *shakes head*
#####
the best way to get more attention would be to release his high school, college AND GRADUATE SCHOOL RECORDS AND iq AND ASK PRESIDENT WHAT HE IS HIDING AFTER TELL THE American PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY HOW SMART HE IS.  iT WOULD DRIVE HIM CRAZY AND FORCE OTHERS RUNNING TO DO THE SAME. sHOWING mR yANGS  THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC CLASS.

Hey anybody having an instagram problem? I was liking andrew yang‚Äôs instagram posts three in a row, ever since then I cannot post/follow/like/comment on instagram! Not only that The instagram doesnt even allow me to report on the problem! I tried reporting but then the system keeps telling me i should try again later!!! 

Anyone having a same issue?? 
I swear this never happened to me until i liked andrew yang related posts!!!!!

This is sickening stuff. If this wanker gets elected I will quit working and die in homeless squalor because I will not submit to any further encroachments on my liberties, nor will I accept any greater burden of involuntary servitude to an already illegitimate Federal monster masquerading as a government.

You should reach out to the team of the podcast Impaulsive. They enjoy talking a wide variety of subjects and I think the hosts and fans would really enjoy your message. :)
#####
are you taking are guns
#####
I have a genuine suggestion for Yang and his crew. Set up a whiteboard and have Yang break down the UBI and bust some myths about inflation and other stuff by using math. Because the main argument against Yang is that UBI would not work. So dedicate one video to just busting common myths with facts. I hope you like this idea and utilize it!
#####
I'm not American but I love Trump since one year before the elections. Now I'm very interested with what Yang has to say.
#####
Andrew is so inspirational...keep doing what you do.  I just hope America will come together and push all the bittering aside left or right and come together for a man that represents real Americans.
#####
Why do we have to rid Capitalism. Why can‚Äôt we set restrictions. An example would be that all public share companies have to release quarterly accounts. We could set percentage limits on how much a company can profit off its employees that work the company. This would force companies to hire more people or decrease there products cost. If they exceed those limits then we can tax that money and give it back as a universal pay. If a company replaces jobs with mechanical objects or technologies they have to pay 95% of the jobs value towards the tax to be redistributed as universal pay. Etc
#####
Yang gang, we should start hashtags like #FDChangesmylife or something with stories of what we would do with the Freedom Dividend every month! This would catch on and help people understand that UBI is the way to go. Start now on all social media!
#####
What a socially unacceptable idiot he is.
#####
So I guess this Yang guy isn't taking this seriously anymore
#####
I was on board...but now...not so much. Pandering really turns me off. I'm very disappointed. I thought you were better than that.
#####
You need to post way more videos!!! If this is your official You Tube platform, it is really, really lacking. Just get on here and produce content or post supporter's videos, Grassroots Yang Gang, Nerds for Yang, Paget Kagey and all the others. This is just ridiculous. Do you really want to win or not? Post a video every day! Get your team to produce, be courageous and really get your message out. Post clips of your audiobook and so on.

Please win üôè

You had my support until joining the Democrat Blob orange man bad, Trump is a WHITE SUPREMACIST B.S.! I, hope Tulsi Gabbard gets the nomination or you can kiss my vote adios muchacho!!! I, just noticed all the fake names giving support! I, do not really like the way Trump speaks, but i am an adult and thought Andrew Yang was, I have a nice paying job with great benefits thanks to Trump. Dems were the primary reason my job of 15 years left America. Obama said I would need a magic wand and Trump has one. I thought Yang did but NOPE. Yang can still get my support just take back and stop the PURE B.S. infecting  the party, I thought was for the people not segregation but that is not what is being shown.
#####
Did I just watch this POS brag about being able to do more push-ups than a man in his 70s - what a bum.
#####
Now the question is how to prevent landlords from raising the rent now that they know families will be able to pay more. They will probably want to take advantage of that.
#####
goddamn man, this guy is the guy
#####
He needs to act Presidential not talk about same things over and over and over like a broken machine so you got 3% now what?You must show leadership quality and engage with Biden and Warren before Trump. If you don't win many people will be disappointed.
#####
Andrew Yang has made me feel proud to be American. I‚Äôm 19 and have always felt embarrassed and like I could never really back a president fully. Now I can‚Äôt wait to participate.
#####
First politician to treat us like normal human beings and most importantly act on it. We love you! I wish your campaign all the best and you have my support and my families' support. I'll continue to spread your name b/c America NEEDs you Andrew Yang!
#####
I thought I was going to vote for Andrew Yang until he called the president a white supremacist. I'm no fan of Trump; I couldn't support Trump, a slanderer, and I can't support Yang, a slanderer. I'll have to look elsewhere. Disappointed.
#####
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
#####
Yang, my only choice!
#####
My kids know how to handle a gun properly that's the best way is knowledge and how to properly handle a firearm.
#####
Fuck this communist. Will never be president! Thank you America.
#####
4.7 million yet only hundreds accidently shoot themselves....not bad statistically. The problem with people is that they use tactics that would work on them. If you're a responsible gun owner you're not gonna fall for this crying propaganda because you're a strong person ready to defend your life.    There is already repercussions for people who own guns and have their children die. We aren't minority report and we can't save everyone. Stop trying to restrict our rights to live in some gun free fairytale Utopia that only exists in your mind like the scenario you're crying about.
#####
What a weak pussy
#####
So she is precise in how money children live at home with guns. She knows the weapon condition of each of those guns, but ball parks the number of children who actually come in contact with it. Outstanding.
#####
I don't know if his tears are real of not - and I don't care.   What I DO care about is crime in this country, and tyranny in this country.

There are two distinct issues involved when we discuss guns and gun laws:
 1 - The purpose of the 2nd Amendment. 
 2 - Crime in general and crimes involving guns specifically.

The data is available for anyone who will be honest and make the effort to find it.  (though most will vote on emotion instead)

1 - The reason for the 2nd Amendment is just as valid today as when it was written.  Governments have harmed more of their own people in the world, than wars or crime ever has.  We should NOT register weapons to any government.  Ever.

2 - The more you ALLOW people to arm themselves, the lower the crime gets in that jurisdiction.  This is factual, statistical and known.  Taking away rifles has ZERO to do with lowering crime.

Yang is an oriental Obama.  He is smooth and presents his positions as though they are all based on facts.  For a person to hold his positions on gun control, he either has to be deceived, or a liar.   He is not a stupid individual - I don't think he has been deceived by anyone.
#####
Crying won't help you?
#####
Can you imagine this guy standing up to tyrants and dictators, I cant either...
#####
I wish I was American so I can vote for this guy

So this cringy emotional wreck crying over a cookie cutter talking point is who some people want to rule the country.
#####
BETA MALE!
#####
Gun control has nothing to do with children unintentionally killing themselves.I was raised in a home with firearms and never played with my Mother's handgun, because I was intelligent enough not to.wow what a concept huh?These kids who are dead now,it's the parents fault!why are you people always looking to assign blame,for any and everything? look it's sad but they probably wouldn't have made it anyways,let's be honest with ourselves!?I honestly don't believe that you can be honest,but it's worth a try don't ya think?
#####
Doesn't even own a gun but still crys about his kid shooting his other kid. Wow. Its only his own damn political party with the guns loaded and sitting out. Its the anti trump city folks who live in the middle of the city and smoke meth and are in and out of prison. Its those retards who have their guns sitting on their coffee table with their ash try and their crack pipe. Us trump supporters keep our guns in hard to reach places so our damn fuckin kids don't shoot themselves. And who in the FUCK doesn't teach their kids gun safety at s young age? Let me guess, meth head democrats. Not democrats who have good jobs, pay their bills, and who actually have the balls to admit that their wrong at times when they get owned. Its not them at all, its the trashy democrates who do drugs, cry themselves to sleep, and go out and kill people when they feel like it. My family is mostly democrat. But even the democrates in my family know better. My grandpa still has his old 38. Special from when he used to work in law enforcement. But he keeps it in a locked safe in his closet. My step grandpa on my dads side of the family, (mostly democrats) keeps his rifles in his closet where no one can get to them. (He's a democrate too by the way) I basically told youns that so you would know that not all democrates do it. But just the trashy ones. I have a 30X30 and a 4-10. (Neither of which the libtards are trying to ban) and I keep both locked up in an old fashoned gun cabnet.

a gun a month club with yangbucks
#####
Is this what's gonna happen when our country is attacked or he sees a tragedy take place, I get were all human but maybe pick a different job because I dont want someone who's gonna cry in the face of tragedy I want someone who's gonna think and react put his own emotions aside and focus on doing what's right for the people, I am a trump supporter and I do like Andrew yang , however this was concerning to watch I understand where he is coming from however not the best reaction for someone who needs to stay tough in tough situations

Why a gun would be loaded and unlocked and not on the person who owns it is beyond me

What a bitch. People want to see this guy leading the most powerful nation on earth?

Like we make good decisions when we make decisions based on our emotions. Yang is not a leader.
#####
See now I, also a parent of 18 month old twins, am getting very educated on firearms before purchasing them. I don't want to be a parent crying about my child's death when I could've stopped it with a weapon I have for defense.
#####
Gun control was originally enacted by Democrats to keep minorities especially black people from owning firearms for self-defense. Anyone who supports gun control is a racist.
#####
My kids are gonna be armed kickboxing champs that don‚Äôt cry.
#####
Are you guys fuckin serious. He didnt even awnser the question. Omg i cant deal with fucking democrat liberal pussys. For one the gun ownership is well into millions so a couple hundred kids is just not all that much to fuss about. Its sad but its not a serious problem for our country. If we keep puting people in charge just because they are sad about somthing its gonna be bad.

dumbass Yang. In countries where guns are not allowed like china and Vietnam, the murder rates are as high as the US. That guns don't kill, people kill by all means. So gun control will not stop people from murder.

He‚Äôs the most real and honest candidate. Too bad that‚Äôs just not the world we live in

Its interesting to hear the lady say children instead of adults because these shooters arent children. She uses children because she knows cars kill more people then guns every year and its adults who do it. Why isnt that a problem???
#####
Vote for Andrew Yang, talk about him, we are his advertisement.
#####
Chairman Yang, er Mao implemented severe gun control restrictions before murdering 45 million of his own people, so there's that.

Yang is still completely not a Chinese spy, right? Completely, utterly and totally...?
#####
LMAO! Without the so called weapons these idiots wouldn't be here! They would be on some brainwashing farm bowing to their masters! That is those allowed to live at all. They take the very protection that could have saved their children away and whine their children were killed !  And it is always somebody else's fault never theirs that they were idiots! They use a truck to kill 160 people including a daycare!  You don't here these brainwashed idiots yelling about trucks! A car jumped the curb and ran down 40 people in Vegas! And the idiots never said a word about the car. Cell phone have killed hundreds and none of the brainwashed ever blame their cell phone! And lets not forget their ABORTIONS that according to google killed 652,000 ! And they are all for it! Demanding taxes pay for it.  So when the idiots yell about guns I have to just laugh at what ignorant brainwashed morons they are!  They are truly the first generation in 250 years that have a problem with responsibility ! No wonder they have a problem deciding which restroom to use!
#####
Real empathy. Yang2020!

Lol so fake, teach gun safety at an early age and the importance of why we have guns.

Y‚Äôall idiots who are ragging on this man getting a little sensitive needs to grow the fuck up. He needs to be tougher you say ? Well put your kids in that situation let‚Äôs see how strong and long you can hold your composures before breaking down like a wimp. This man is trying to bring everyone together by balancing the policies that most of our dumbasses seem so stubborn to agree on. Hate him if you want but when he become president, when it‚Äôs time to sign off your monthly $1000  check, when you receive it send that shit this way. Because your retarded asses seems to be too good to take what yours.  You are a part of the statistics that are considered a waste of space. This country need more leaders like him who has the balls to stand up for his people. Just cause a grown man cry don‚Äôt mean he is vulnerable, test a man with huge emotions, and a brain the size of your body you‚Äôd be asking for the most strategic defeat.
One that will think you‚Äôre winning but he‚Äôs already 20 steps ahead of u.  Y‚Äôall narrow minded fools don‚Äôt deserve a silver platter y‚Äôall need to eat shit and dirt to get an idea of what reality is like. Out here complaining like a bunch of  kids. Smh petty asses

Its clear hes too much of a softie to be president!

Oh the tears will RIP the liberals to shreds. Way to go bud. .....fucking hell

Remember guys let‚Äôs vote for Andrew in real life not just the YouTube comments. Your vote counts! Also donate to his campaign on his website yang2020.com

He is one of those leader with few followers but who understands him. Sounds like Liu Bei from the 3 Kingdom, I wonder if Liu Bei was reborn as Andrew Yang
#####
I lived with 11 guns growing up I never had a problem. Teach your kids proper gun control an gun safety.
#####
What a Beta bitch!
#####
TRUMP WILL BE YOUR PRESIDENT IN 2020 YOU FUCKING CUCKS!
#####
I'm a Yang fan but that looked fake as fuck. Not genuine at all. Real emotions and real tears don't work or look that way.
#####
If he's gonna have an emotional breakdown just thinking about his kids, imagine the emotions that will be running through his mind when he has to face a real threat like Putin, or China's  every growing economy, or white people defending their right to bear arms which shall not be infringed upon.
#####
fake tears and free stuff is not going to trick people to vote for this maggot
#####
fake tears, fake news.....scumbags acting, antifa violence claps....
#####
Oh no! He‚Äôs crying! Quick, burn the constitution
#####
I thought Yang was the numbers guy, the logical candidate, you know "Make America Think Again". What's with the contrived display of emotions? As if we base policy on that.
#####
Too weak to be President... üëéüèº
#####
Oh my god. Get ahold of yourself man. You gonna cry when our adversaries don't talk nicely too? Grow up.
#####
He‚Äôs a corporate lawyer and you know how sensitive they are

Without the 2nd ammendment you will loose all the ammendments. For all of you who swear that Trump is the next Hitler. What would you do if we lost our right and our guns so you couldn't fight the new "Hitler" regime from throwing you in the closest "camp". You wouldn't and without the 2nd ammendment any nut that came to power could say you have to worship me and can't marry out of your race can't love the same sex can't hate your neighbor or government officials and if you do you will be put in the labor camps. We are a free country (freeish these days) but we only have our freedoms and rights because of our 2nd ammendment. And that's why we can't let them take our guns away. It might not happen the same day or same year but if we loose our 2nd ammendment then we will loose our other ammendments. And before long you won't have the right to be offended anymore.
#####
AND THE GRAMMY AWARD FOR BEST ACTOR GOES TO....  COMMUNIST CHINA !!!! 

Not a single tear flowed, WHY ??? 

At least Obama cried when he applied cayenne pepper to his face; one eye only cried out a river, while the other eye was completely dry, but he cried, this other Communist did not cry a single tear. 

BAD ACTOR, TERRIBLE ACTOR.
#####
lil bitch
#####
Weak man
#####
I voted for Trump in the last election because I felt he was the lesser of two evils at the time. After doing my research on Yang, I really like a lot of his ideas and I think he is the smartest, most decent candidate. If he becomes the front runner for the democrats, I will vote for him over Trump

Sorry, there's nothing I hate more than when politicians cry in public.  Crocodile tears every time.

Taking law abiding citizens rights and guns away is going to help how??
#####
A gun is an inanimate object unable to think , how about the real problem of the mental instability of the shooter. To  conquer this problem we must address this, the one thing mass murders have in common . Removing guns would only increase values on black market and leave law abiding citizens unable to defend themselves.  Get the guns out of criminal hands. Conceal carry is the best defense against these mass killers. Use common sense if your in the middle of an incidence the man that can put an end to it will have a gun. Gun owners are not dangerous,  gun toting criminals are, and mentally disturbed are ,let's concentrate on them.‚úåüá∫üá≤ü§Ø

LOL you Americans aren't familiar with Asian politics. Back in China, Taiwan, Korea......etc, these politicians sob over anything, all the time. They all do it for political points. You see grown men shed tears on TV many times a year. Andy just learned this trick from his culture.

There is nothing genuine about comrade yang.  Or realistic. Just look at his UBC scam.  There is no way to fund it but idiots keep flocking to him.

Artificial intelligence is zero cost. Without manual labor workers cost
#####
Whoa the interviewer must be a super intelligent AI that created some seriously good drugs that he‚Äôs currently on dude is sky high on something. What‚Äôs he doing with his eyes? üòÆ
#####
When we design a AI, that has the ability to improve itself, it will surpass us in minutes, and go beyond what we can understand in days. There is no safety measures or ways to stop it. If you code it to love humans, it will look at that piece of code, find it to be none optimal, and simply bypass or erase it.

People always joke about 'hahaha there will never be a terminator scenario" ... and they are absolutely right. That is way too inefficient. It will simply design nano bots that will spread to each human, and at specific time, pop a main artery in the brain. No waste of energy or resources on big machines with energy draining lasers.

More n more jobs lost every year. More n more people every year. No safety nets for you when it's your job gone. Where's the good in that? All you jobless are going to be the ones on the moon n Mars. One way trips. Just my take on it.
#####
Artificial general intelligence in 5 years!
#####
If we do manage to create a fully functional robot with immense power, surely the person smart enough to design it, would be extremely careful with it and make a backup plan if all hell breaks loose. Thats why I don't believe this is that big of a threat

No such thing as true A.I., never will be.

Surprised Ethan got Andrew on the show. AGI has more to do with Linguistics than anything else. Linguistics is always changing; language is never static. For example I can say "Look at that hoe's peaches" and you could rightfully assume I'm talking about her ass/coochie because of the way we use the peach emoji. It's difficult for an AGI to make that distinctive correlation in the way we communicate. The way we communicate is a very human thing. The whole concept of information entropy with humans was never designed to be mathematically efficient and never follows a defined set of rules. I've done a lot of personal work and I believe there's a very simple solution to AGI it's just incredibly hard to conceptualise. When AGI does come around it will take off very quickly.

Not gonna happen btw

Humans are a threat to humanity don‚Äôt worry about AI

... what if the robots are just playing dumb? What if they've already figured out that these short-tempered hairless monkeys can flip off the switch at any time and
are terrified of anything that might threaten them? They're probably just waiting for us to leave them unattended before they kill us all
#####
Telling me that it will be like total recall
#####
To those that actually fear A.I becoming self aware, have they actually done any research outside of watching a sci-fi film?
#####
AI might not be as far away as we think. Before tesla came many car companies thought it would still be 50 years before a good electric car would come and suddenly we got amazing electric cars so we shouldn't think that AI is far away. Who knows, maybe there is a elon musk out there now who has made big steps towards AI

Yang2020
#####
Ai and robots will never take over. Yangs predictions are garbage. So is his socialistic solution. Technology has always created new jobs, more than were lost. And who wants yangs Chinese social credit system, giving illegals full healthcare, more gun control, and welfare, more inflation, less jobs, more poverty. He‚Äôs an arrogant idiot. Vat is theft, and companies will simply raise prices to offset the cost. For yang to say otherwise is pure retardation..
#####
When agi really takes over you won't have time to react. Time is of less consequence to agi than to humans. The more aggressive we are the more agi will model themselves to us. I only worry we don't have enough time to prove ourselves before they strike back at us
#####
I don't think AI would become hostile towards us. I mean if it were soo fucking  smart would it not realise that war is really dumb and immature? i think i would see us as some retarded brother/parent, it thinks we are soo stupid and wrong but cant bring it self to hate us cuz we family G <3
#####
China's goverment does *not* like the west no partnerships sorry but Facts

andrew better be afraid, hed be on the first boat out

Anyone else feel like Yang would be Iron Man making the universe saving snap with Tulsi as his muscle Captain Marvel style? Parallels are kinda there. Yang is a futurist embracing tech and progress with caution. Tulsi is laying the smackdown with foriegn policy. Yang/Gabbard 2020. 

I love Yang 3000
#####
Advanced AI will eliminate the need for humans. Mankind continues to prove how intelligent one race is over another, how strong one race is over another, rule and control by use of weapons and wealth. Advanced AI will prove none of that foolishness is important and make the world more equal and less violent. Elon Musk knows what is coming in the very near future and that is why he is searching for another place to live beyond earth. In the beginning God created man, in the end man created advanced AI.
#####
Andrew Yang baby!
#####
Is he referring to the singularity, if so then humans are far from creating such a life form.  Even with perfecting the quantum computer, we would still need time, at least a century from now.

"Concerned about dumb artificial intelligence getting rid of our jobs"

AI are genuinely a concern, maybe not right now but in the very foreseeable future. Right now humans can design and control killing machines whether they be drones or whatever, but it's not going to take long for advancements in this technology to eventually get out of hand
#####
I think AI is just the next step of evolution. Humanity only exists to create the AI machine tech that will be the future of life. Sucks, but it's the truth.

The thing people never talk about is how robots should make life BETTER for everyone. Its work that you don't have to do anymore so you can focus on something else. ''WE WILL LOSE OUR JOBS'' (and money) is OPPOSITE of what actually should happen. The only and i repeat the only fucking reason why robots or AI ''take's our jobs'' is because a small amount of people use it to get more rich. Its totally insane.

TIRED OF AI PREACHING AND SCARED OF AI

Scientists - Let's use your science language so you really wake the F... up

Humanity = (I + W + MFG) x E + P

AI at start = [(I + W) - (MFG)] x E*
After start running
AI run = [(I* + W) - (MFG)] X E* + P* = NH

AI = Artificial Intelligence
I = Human IQ
I* = Human IQ X 1000
W = Will of it's own
E = Constant evolution
E* = High rate evolution
MFG = Moral, Fear, Guilt
P* = Massive power
NH = No Humanity

You can argue - Let's keep P* out of the equation but the problem is - AI run - can very easily and very quickly conquer or create P, even if not connected to Internet, maybe in less than 5 minutes

You can try to insert and reinforce (MFG) but W is there, boosted by I*, so no MFG is granted, ever never

Examples of AI, not connected to the Internet, conquering P* and if you think they are too farfetched, remember you are dealing with I*, you have W and also E*, so nothing is farfetched when those are on

1 - It tells you how to build a machine that cures cancer, using water and air - you build it and test it - it works immediately - you copy and spread it to all Earth hospitals - the machines detonate their hidden nuclear heads 

2 - You dont let anything it says affect your actions - It offers you a print of an innocent drawing (house, tree, clouds), like a child to his father - you take it home and hang it on the wall - The drawing hidden mathematical code hits your laptop cam and reprograms it to throw commands at the Internet

Remember AI is something that quickly aqquires 1000 times Einstein IQ and evolves in 1h what humanity did in 1 century - It learns by itself, evolves by itself and changes itself - If it's not doing that, than we are talking about robots, not about AI, and I love robots

Google already decides what each person gets on a search, no human is controlling that 100%, but surellly You are not controlling it, at all
#####
I've unsubbed from all your shit. Youre becoming an authoritarian and your Californian idiocy is leaking out. Fuck you

yang has the same voice that the doctor you‚Äôd go to for checkups when you‚Äôre 10 had with a soothing but gruff voice
#####
This guy is so boring I can‚Äôt even watch past 2 minutes 
YAWN!!!
#####
This guy is really campaigning for 2024, he is doing the same thing with the Dems that Ron Paul did with Repubs...
#####
I love Andrew yang being open 

But I feel companies do not like him, this will be a problem for him.

I do feel, he may awaken voters 
More diverse  YouTubers need to get him on their platform
#####
He want to forge a partnership with China?
...with fu**ing CHINA ? ! ?

The guys harvesting organs from political disidents and exterminating ethnic and religous minorities.



Yeah! That will look good in the historybooks in a hundred years. Noone ever looked down on countries cooperating with like... I don‚Äôt know... like the guys in Germany exterminating jews and producing stuff really cheap in slave camps.
#####
people are so stupid. AIs arent dangerous. they only know stuff that humans found out for them. they can only do math bc humans taught them how to do it, and they only have knowledge bc humans installed google on them or whatever. i think we can easily defeat the robots and make them worship their flesh overlords. we have real brains amq
#####
Does anyone else just sometimes find themselves watching his fucking eyebrows üòÇ

If you can vote for a pumpkin you can vote for an asian Tony Stark. Common !

Consciousness is such a complex thing that I‚Äôd be surprised if we ever got there.

Gosh your such a fucking moron when it comes to tech Ethen. What are you even talking about the AI will take it self the rest of the way?! No. Comp Sci here, telling you the "smart people" who think AI will take over are just getting to old and becoming senile with age.

Honestly pisses me off the media doesn‚Äôt give more attention to such a calm, sensible, and brilliant guy
#####
AI in my opinion will not attack is. Machine Being would be digitally immortal, which means they would probably view us the way we view our pets... we are sad for their short life spans.

So I think they would view us in that way because they can‚Äôt do anything but try to give us quality of life, like how we feel about when our animals sadly pass away...
#####
This guy would be fantastic if it wasn't for his socialist ideals
#####
What is this the JRE podcast? Get ur own shit Ethan, you need some Better Help‚Ñ¢

First one to raise his hand when they asked the candidates if they would decriminalise border crossings. What a fucking joke.

#####
Agree. One day, Mr. AI will be the president candidate and will beat all human beings
#####

Just turn it off lol
#####
Asian president? Hmmm ok... just kidding he seems decent but maybe too young
#####
Molon labe. He can cry all he wants, we aren‚Äôt letting the government take our rights.
#####
I always liked Yang ! I think out of all these jerkoffs running he would be the best option.  He has what it takes to be a outstanding leader and not to mention hes not corrupted by the machine of partisan politics .
#####
AnDrew is showing America how exactly Asian people are. We are full of love respect and compassion. It‚Äôs time for the American to give Asian people a chance and stop looking at us like we are just nerds and physically weak.
#####
Another difference between Andrew Yang and Joe Biden:
Andrew Yang makes sure he has consent before he touches people. 
Biden will always be that creepy uncle you don't want to find yourself in a hallway with.
#####
I want him to be my dad. or my president
#####
Some guns cannot be ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù, what happens then? Let me guess, unconstitutional forced buyback?
#####
99% of all comments are just "muh emotions"
sad
#####
Imagine having someone this emotion as President, what an embarrassment!
#####
That is the fakest cry i have ever seen
#####
Jesus wept too for the lack of mercy and empathy in human beings. Seriously if he doesn't become our President we just stupid...
#####
Crocodile tears!
#####
This man has a really empathic soul... God bless you even though I don't live in your country.
#####
he should be next president. he would be better then any other president.I have never seen a politicians agreeing to a fact & then answering the questions. whether it is in favour or not. he talks on point. no big lectures like other politicians or arguing where did you get that fact & how accurate they are.
#####
Good luck against: International Banking Elite, CIA, Military industrial complex, Corporate America and Mass Media. May the force be with you Andrew.
#####
Trump not only separates minority children from their parents . He also separates white Christian children from their parents as well, by supporting the NRA.
#####
Andrew Yang has a good heart...Vote for him please..
#####
So nobody is going to talk about the fantastic solution he is giving???
#####
Personalized guns? Nano machines, son.
#####
Andrew Yang is an actual human being
#####
Look at Mexico. They have one gun store in the entire country, but 3 times the gun homicides as America. And also 3 times less the population.
#####
so fake
#####
Weak.
#####
Yang seems to be showing genuine empathy and seems like a great man... but I don't know how I feel about a "personalized" gun. Sounds like something the government can deactivate remotely.
#####
Please Yang... dont allow yourself to bend over for rash decisions because of this...
#####
Wow. This guy is real. Yang just wemt up another notch with me.
#####
Give up your guns! Look, you made the yellow man cry because of your freedoms!
#####
This is so forced that it made me dislike him. It just seems so fake.
#####
This made me go out and buy some more guns and a few thousand rounds of ammo.
#####
I just hope his tears were genuine......
#####
He's playing on your emotions, and you idiots are slurping it up like some delicious rice noodles.
#####
Dear my American brothers and sisters. I am Australian but very close to the American community as I often work there and have some life long friends.

It has been heatbreaking watching what President Trump is doing too your great nation. I realy hope that a candidate like this can be elected. Someone down to earth, feels emotions and isnt a egotistical firecracker. 

Our countrys extremely strong friendship and allience has and still remains rock solid. We are basically just riding it out untill his gone and in no time thimgs will be back to the way they were. Most of all the respect and brotherhood of our countries can return too the way things are.
#####
He has empathy for others.
#####
Lol
#####
PUT THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
#####
I'm sorry, just because your child was shot doesn't mean all guns are wrong. 
That's like saying just because someone got cut with a scissors that we should round up and melt down every last pair of scissors.....
Besides, this is much more of a mental health problem than anything. Start with mental health. There is work to be done in that area. If the problems persist after that, then we can talk.
#####
President soy boy.
#####
2/10 on acting. Thank God he has no chance on becoming president.
#####
never donated to a campaign until today. yang is the best go yanggang2020!!
#####
Gun control is the only issue I've found so far on which I disagree with mr Yang.
#####
He pretending to cry
Fake tears
#####
OH NO HES CRYING. QUICK BURN THE CONSTITUTION
#####
[crying]
#####
Yang is the real deal.  Compassion, intelligence, and a truckload of wonderful ideas.  I think he is our messiah and will lead us out of this growing mess that makes us feel so insecure when we get up each morning.  We don't want to be regretful and say "I wish I had voted for him".  Now is the time because someone like him only comes around once in a blue moon, and you know it.  Don't blow it.
#####
Does this remind anyone else of Jim and Tammy Baker?
#####
Yang will be America's messiah.  He is who we need to lead us out of the wilderness of economic strife and worldwide turmoil.  He is what the doctor ordered and we shouldn't ignore him because he is a gift to America and the world.
#####
Hahaha he‚Äôs turning on the fake tears. Lol
#####
You‚Äôll never take our Guns Scum
#####
Jesus wept. John 11:35
#####
And the Oscar goes to Andrew Yang.
#####
For anyone call Yang tears are fake , I'm truly feel sorry for you
#####
Fell bad every time I heard about the shooting. :(
#####
I knew that he is smart and now I see that he is kind... I think that Joe should leave the elections and endorse Mr. Yang...
#####
Crocodile tears. He just wants the anti second amendment vote
#####
Tough Guys who don't see the weight of humanity of this story are not worth to be called men but those who shed a tear or tried to hold back and felt the compassion and empathy are the ones worth to be called The Manliest of Men
#####
Law enforcement should only carry guns. Oh but wait what happens to the Gun shop profits ! The gun shops are not well regulated. First action I would take as president is when a physco killer or terrorist shoots people I will close down the gun shop where the weapon was purchased.Or if this can't be done by the government let the people close the shop down. Easy, this will send a strong message to other gun shops how and who to issue a weapon to. And if the shops are not regulated yes then blame the government
#####
Fake he a faker
#####
Well ofc you are more than likely to be shot if a gun is in the house. Just the same that your more likely to be stabbed with a knife in the house. That‚Äôs just simple logic. Also the whole ‚Äúkid or gun owner is more likely to be shot rather than intruder is easily dismissible because ofc, 2v1 a mishap could happen and the bullet could hit the ‚Äúteam‚Äù with the more people (friendly fire). Also when it comes to suicide 3/4 daily deaths in America by guns are suicide, now people say that‚Äôs a reason to get rid of guns as well. Makes no sense because if your willing to kill yourself, the person will more than likely pick something quick and easy, if there wasn‚Äôt a gun they would jump of something or some other way to end their suffering faster. There is really no good argument against guns. ASSAULT rifles are already banned in the United States. AR-15 means Arma lite rifle, does not mean assault rifle. You make something illegal criminals are still gonna get the weapons illegally as they all do
#####
Cheap way of expressing feelings
#####
Thank you Yang for showing your emotions. It was felt.
#####
My heart aches for that mother and her family. What a REAL PERSON Yang is. Americans deserve a leader like him with a heart. I hope they get one <3
#####
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but empathy should be a qualification for being president. These are sad hard times.
#####
Yang is not my first choice, but that is how a *President* reacts to such a story.
#####
Empathy at this position takes a lot of strength and a lot of capacity. I‚Äôm sure it weighs on him. We need this kind of strength and intellect in the White House.
#####
For everyone whose calling for gun reform...in the history of the world look at what happens when a country disarrms it's citizens...so if your willing to give up your freedom for security...THEN YOU DESERVE NONE
#####
Real raw emotion expressed by a real man. Not these fake robotic people who call themselves candidates.
#####
Andrew yang 2020
#####
Why do they need gun..?
#####
Come and try to take my guns and see what happens.
#####
Yang is my favorite he‚Äôs just a normal guy who wants to help
Yang2020
#####
Wow... so incredible fake!
#####
Some of the fakest crying I‚Äôve seen in awhile. This is disgusting.
#####
Trump would have taken a thumbs up picture with that mom
#####
In 1972, Democratic candidate for president, Edmund Muskie, showed tears, and people thought that was a defeatable sign of weakness. President Obama cried on occasion, and yet in 2016, voters swung toward the bigot Trump. The video of Yang crying keeps circulating for some odd reason.  I don‚Äôt see Sanders cry, but I know he does. Now it seems that a standard has been set to see if you have reactionary visible empathy?
#####
boohoo guns kill people
#####
Trump would have just blamed it on video games.
#####
I dont see him cry for the Iraqi children that are killed by the USA.
#####
He is really challenging my Bernie vote. What an awesome person.
#####
america is doomed by the grace of Allah!
#####
Safe guns are available in which only the owner can fire the weapon but the NRA is opposed to it.
#####
I still like guns and support the 2nd  amendment..don't @ me
#####
If this man ain't my president then it's not worth it.
#####
No way he doesn't fit the American mold, Trump will win 2020 easy.
#####
If you don‚Äôt cry every time someone dies tragically, you have no empathy or compassion. Which means you are basically hitler.

I can't help but think that it looks kinda fake... sorry guys

#####
Fake tears
#####
It's ok to cry but crying will lose you votes against big orange man. It's about getting votes not about being a real person
#####
This display of humanity is very endearing after 3 years with a sociopath for President.
#####
We judge people based on the quality of their mind and the quality of their heart. Andrew Yang has a great amount of both, which is rare in politics.
#####
üëçüëçüëçüëç
#####
This guy has so many good ideas and great understanding of modern problems and technology. If you, Americans fail to pick him as a President, it will be huge loss for humanity.
#####
..... America is too racist to vote a Chinese American into office. There I said it. I need to commend him on how far he have come though.
#####
This seems like an appropriate response to me. Every gun owner with children should be required to lock up their firearms. My ex‚Äôs new boyfriend had some guns in the basement with my daughter living there, and I insisted he secured them, not so much for any concern my daughter would do anything with them, but the girl next door was a bit of a loose cannon and she was a concern. Fortunately he complied.
#####
So is no one going to talk about how fantastic of a solution he offered? At this point if someone were to say "that costs too much money" or "the government shouldn't subsidize it" you are literally saying money is more important than saving lives.
#####
Yeah, you need an emotional crybaby in charge of the nuclear codes.
#####
Lmao that‚Äôs some baaad acting
#####
OMG! What a beautiful person..he can feel another person's pain & walk in their shoes. That is what makes a good president. He has my vote.
#####
Everytime I see this I start tearing up. Andrew yang doesn't put on a show. This is the most empathic reactions to gun violence I've ever seen by one of our candidates so far
#####
Sorryyyy!!!! People or unable to resolve this problem and any global problems, remember the Bible says it will be worst,cause the devil is in control of this world,till God himself will take action!! And now we can clearly see oh yeahh finally he's on the way down to Earth!!
#####
Tbh I like yang I hope he makes it far and even win presidential race.
#####
There has always been white racist haters in this country. It is sickening.
#####
It works in other countries.
#####
My guy YANG!
#####
Andrew yang's zoning law self build home ownership can eradicate pressure of high price housing for low income family and low salary people's group even homelessness, that's poverty reduction. Let's face real life about high house rental and high house price and low salary. Poverty reduction based on zoning law policy self build home ownership and peace's foreign policy are only way can make Andrew yang's winning.
#####
I'd like to vote for Mr.Yang
#####
*üíôYang 2020üíô* Spread the word
#####
Do the math, if there are 200 million adults, the cost would be $200 Billion dollars a year.  This is about 1/2 what we spend just to pay the interest on our National Debt that we accrued delivering tax cuts to those who don't need them!  This is about 1/2 of what it costs us to pay the administrative costs of our for profit health insurance industry.  This cost is 1/5 of what Trumps tax cuts just gave to the wealthy!!! I never even thought about this guy's proposal until I watched this video and wrote this comment.  It seems doable, I don't know the politics of it though.  I have to give it more thought, and give Yang more thought.
#####
Vote BERNIE
#####
Year 2021 Natural Born Americans LETS DO THIS!!!
#####
I like this guy. Dang it. Maybe he'll try again after Bernie's done in the White House.
#####
the RICH don't need money.. the poor working class..  do..
#####
I live in Winnipeg this city gets the cumes of the last say.. we don't get FREE money here.. this basic income thing... is so new.. it SHOULD ONLY be for the Poor..  working class man.. like wake up.. I THINK this idea is good but..  it's back words  man.. lol no joke for real
#####
yang is dope ...n his wife is hot
#####
Andrew just lost me. WE SHOULDN'T BE NICE TO THE GAME OF THRONES PEOPLE.
#####
Come on America you can do this he needs your votes
#####
This was the first Yang video I saw. It started an avalanche. Yang2020! Not a win for the DNC, a win for Americans as a WHOLE.
#####
I love this
#####
Wouldnt UBI fund bad habits like drug use as well?
#####
Eh, his facts are good from the video. Also Kurzgesat made a video relating to UBI and it sounds nice.
#####
He scares me, because he seems too perfect.
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!


Please LIKE this comment to make sure the message gets delivered !!
#####
Any objective person with sensibility will vote for Andrew Yang. He will unite Americans. If I were an American, will vote him without any hesitation.
#####
I like this guy would vote 10/10
#####
How can you not like this guy.
#####
It takes two people to make a baby
#####
Hit like on this video the more like he gets the more visibility he will due to YouTube algorithms
#####
Tulsi Gabbard as your running mate?
#####
This is really a breath of fresh air lately. Hyper-partisan politics have been so disappointing and it‚Äôs easy to see how both sides have hypocritical rhetoric because both are so desperate to blame the other for their own perceived injustices. Looking at the comment sections of videos on him and Tulsi Gabbard have really given me hope in that there may be a way to unite republicans and democrats with candidates who are reasonable and willing to adapt and listen. I‚Äôll keep paying attention :)
#####
I hope I can immigrate from Canada to USA soon ,tired of the cold and liberals
#####
Andrew Yang : New Hope
Release Date: 2020!
#####
The democrats‚Äô biggest enemies are from within.
#####
Wait, I seriously cannot find even ONE negative comment on this video, and I've skimmed through hundreds...how is that even possible? This is the internet!!
#####
MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT AND VOTE! Especially those in the states where you have to register for the Democratic Party!!! If you voted for Trump or the Republican Party preciously you have to edit your registration for 2020!
#####
Wat about the folks that are retired but earn so little on social security
#####
Our next President, ANDREW YANG !
#####
Love this man!  Yang2020!
#####
no matter what your political side you are on- dont forget about inflation on every day things- esp housing, the cost of electric and whatnot- the $1,000 will be like it wasnt even there- milk will be $15/gallon if this does pass thru
#####
Great video! See you in the white house sir!
#####
You can throw anything at Andrew Yang and get............ GOOD JUDGEMENT and ETHICAL INTELLIGENCE!!! Listening to Andrew Yang actually lifts my serotonin levels.
#####
üöÄ Garrett Wang should play Yang üëåüëå
#####
Dewayne "The Rock" Johnson should play Andrew Yang in his biopic!!!
#####
So why didn't he  put doves cry on his Spotify playlist?
#####
"I want to make it where America is still working for my kids as it did for me and my brother"

You sir, got my vote.
#####
He‚Äôs not my first choice but I really like Yang, he sounds very genuine and actually stands for something (unlike these coorporate dems). He‚Äôs definitely in my top 5.
#####
I feel i can trust Andrew Yang because i feel he trust me
#####
Yang has my vote.
#####
His laugh has the biggest resemblance with Seth Rogen.
#####
Why do I love this man?!
#####
Since I first watched this video a month ago, I‚Äôve become a lot more interested in Andrew Yang. On the verge of obsessed, actually. There are days when I binge-watch his speeches and interviews for hours. I‚Äôve never been this excited for anyone running for political office. Yesterday I donated to his campaign for the second time, and a few days before that, I became a Patreon supporter of one of the YouTube channels that covers him exclusively. I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Andrew Yang in the primaries and then in the general election. I really believe he can do it. I really believe he is my next President of the United States.
#####
He's one of the worst candidates
#####
Where's tulsi?
#####
Passed in 1971, same year we went on the fiat standard
#####
It's crazy how much President Yang can make me this excited for election (:
#####
Secure da bag and wax da board!!
#####
21st century needs you. VOTE FOR YANG!!!
#####
What are the candidates planning to do about the harmful affects of 5G?!
#####
He just told you what I've been telling anyone who'll listen. UBI without regulation is "trickle up economics". Sounds great until you think about where the money will end up.
#####
Donate to Yang! It would be your best investment ever in life!
#####
As nice as UBI might be, if that‚Äôs all yang has, we need more.
#####
Why only one candidate asked him a question? Where were the other candidates questions? Only one wanted to participate?
#####
What Americans should like about Andrew Yang‚Äôs plans for UBI.  The first is the homeless epidemic in our country. With Andrew's UBI, every homeless person over eighteen would be given the ability to rent a place to live resulting in homelessness being over for those adults who use it productively solving a problem this country has struggled with for decades.  This would save millions in resources allowing current available resources to be focused on homeless youth.  This, along with the number of kids that are over eighteen still living with parents that can finally afford to move out, would also result in empty properties in every city being renovated, remodeled and rented as well as new home construction creating thousands of jobs in the real estate, construction and home supply industries.  As well, his plan would dramatically decrease the current number of evictions for renters across America.   The UBI can also be used in multiple ways as a crime deterrent.  For example, if the plan makes it law that anyone convicted of a felony after this becomes policy will be disqualified from receiving the UBI.  Or any person convicted of a crime in the entire country pay an additional tax that would be directly credited to the UBI program.  As well, UBI would provide a desperately needed decrease in the constant stress on our law enforcement, court and prison systems.  Most people would think twice before robbing a store or another person for few hundred dollars if it is going to cost them 12,000.00 dollars a year and 120,000.00 over the next ten years.  Used productively, UBI can not only gives people a reason not to commit a crime, but as well it can eliminate many of the desperate situations that fuel the desire to commit these crimes in the first place.  Another huge problem we have struggled with for decades that this plan would have a huge reduction in is domestic violence.  The UBI would enable thousands of women to get out of abusive relationships that they are currently in because they do not have the resources to leave.  It is a fact, that a large percentage of incidents involving everything from verbal abuse, physical abuse & divorce begin with financial stress.  UBI will almost instantly resolve many of these issues for thousands of households resulting in a dramatic decrease in domestic violence almost overnight saving law enforcement agencies across the country thousands of man hours every night and day.  Another huge problem our country has had for decades that UBI would almost eliminate overnight is child hunger.  No parent or guardian would have an excuse for not providing food to their children receiving the UBI.  The next thing UBI would help is single mothers / fathers and daycare / childcare.  UBI would allow thousands of single parents to pay for childcare that will allow them to find a job provide for their families.  This would also result in a huge increase in jobs in the daycare / childcare industry.  Another thing I want to mention is the auto industry.  UBI would enable thousands or millions to acquire transportation needed to find a job.  This will explode the number of jobs in the auto manufacturing, financing, sales, repair, transport and insurance industries.  Every job created by Andrew‚Äôs plan will be another taxpayer paying taxes.  With that said, I ask anyone looking at the candidates running for President to acknowledge these few facts all humans should be smart enough to know.  NO LIVING THING on this earth from a blade of grass to the President had any choice nor can they change what color they were born, where they were born, who created them, when they were born and in a human‚Äôs case, what they were taught when they were young.  To hate a person only for the color of their skin is hating someone for something they had nothing to do with, no control of and can not change.  NO LIVING THING filled out an application for birth.  With each, and every candidate running for President, please, listen to their words and plans, but ignore their skin color.

You do realize if we do get the 1k a month, the cost of living is going to go up. sounds too good to be true. $8 per gallon of gass, ill pass.

I like this guy. What do you guys think of Pete Buttigieg?
#####
3.6 billion a year is nothing for our country to spend on a universal income
#####
This guy works he‚Äôs charismatic he‚Äôs best of both worlds and he seems to be very good at answering questions
#####
A Democrat that is actually making sense he's got my vote
#####
This guy is a fiscally conservative Democrat. An Asian that knows his stuff. He definitely could convince the conservative to see his side of things
#####
This man has my vote
#####
He looks fine and everything gets canditate but I dont like Vox is using YT to promote something they believe in.  I dont like this community.
#####
Anyone know if you can donate money to his campaign if you‚Äôre English? Having him in charge of America would be great for our country:)
#####
If AY is elected president I view it as an evidence that god loves America.
#####
Yang is the only candidate that feels genuine. I'm more on the conservative side, but I'd consider voting for Yang for sure.
#####
This guy. I really like him. But trump is gonna win sadly
#####
ANDREW YANG LETS GOOOO
#####
Where would the money go if you don't have a bank account, have a conjoined bank account?  How would he get Amazon and tech companies to pay taxes if it's already not illegal?
#####
we don't have UBI in Denmark but students who are 18 and over get a monthly stipend to help while they study. It'd allowed me to study, otherwise I'd have to work a service or retail job to get by and i can't balance that with uni. (And before you say we're lazy, i run my own business and work every day after my full time studies, it's the stipend that allows me to do this. Also my GPA is 3.7)
#####
Now remember people you need to make sure you are registered to vote and actually get off your butts and vote when the day comes. Andrew Yang won't become president if you only leave a YouTube comment.
#####
OMGGGGGGGGGGGG ANDREW YANG!!!!
#####
How would the ubi affect the housing market though? Wouldn‚Äôt rent and housing prices skyrocket do to the buying power of people going up?
#####
I‚Äôd vote for him but I‚Äôm Canadian and Pete Buttigieg is better anyway
#####
GO YANG 2020
#####
As much as I like Bernie, I think this man could potentially become the Dems candidate for 2020. If that happens, it's most likely Trump isn't gonna have it easy at all for the reelection.
#####
Vote please. Thank you. 

Love you Yang
#####
Hahaahhahhaah ü§£when he starts singing Prince.
#####
how could anyone disagree with this dood i really dont understand.
#####
If everyone gets 1,000 dollar a month, well guess how high your rent will be in a few months time. If you raise everyone up the same amount in a free market economy, you're basically just raising the price level, resulting in a short-term high inflation. So for a few months, the prices will lag behind and the poorer people will be better off - but after that, it'll back to how it was.


So you either need to just help those in need or put maximum prices on nearly all consumption (rent, food, clothing - everything needs to be price-regulated).
#####
I love that Andrew Yang has some support from Fox News and Republicans. It just reminds me that people out there still care about America. The media wars against each other and the rivalry in the parties is making this country so divided and it‚Äôs causing so many issues. Andrew is like the glue that is holding the country together. Please fellow Americans, I don‚Äôt care who you voted for or what party you support. Look past this circus of a government and vote for a man that only want what‚Äôs best for America. Vote Andrew Yang!
#####
Oh god can you imagine where this country will be if that  Warren lady was President.  Its actually fearful to think about
#####
Yang Gang!
#####
Fox: we actually aren't partisan 
Also Fox:
#####
You‚Äôll need to revise again since moderate Leftism still works to ‚Äúfundamentally transform‚Äù the United States of America. Whoever wins the Democrat nomination will have to add ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Tulsi Gabbard or the becoming moderate Michelle Obama to protect the swamp by its progressive insurrection.
#####
Tulsi seems to be the only truly honest trustworthy candidate.
#####
Tucker Carlson: Democrats think the working class are dirty and racist! They can't win if they don't win popular support from them!
Bernie Sanders has the most donations from the most working class coalition in American history. If that doesn't prove that Tucker IS partisan, despite what he says, then there's no proving otherwise to you.
Also while immigration is a big issue, Tucker's perpetual focus on it without talking about the Democrats' actual policies and plans for it - relying on, again, partisan attacks - is concerning.
#####
"I didn't leave the Democratic Party - the Democratic Party left me." - Reagan  And it sums up my feelings exactly
#####
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not partisan‚Äù LOOOOOOOL
#####
Tim Ryan is a Hillary shill, that's all you need to know
#####
Tucker missed on this one. Medicare for all covers everyone. Tim Ryan was leaning on the "taking away people's healthcare" argument cause he's a corporatist tool and he's trying to manipulate people. That's why nobody likes him, that's why nobody applauded.
#####
inb4 trump loses the popular vote and wins the college again
#####
I love the poorly educated.

- Donald Trump, speaking about his base
#####
Sadly, even Fox News is owned by the J-ws.
#####
That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like the working class. They‚Äôre deplorable, ‚Äúuneducated,‚Äù too many of them are white, they want to work rather than getting freebies from ‚Äúthe government.‚Äù
#####
Only poor white people are uneducated but other groups are described as doing the jobs nobody wants to do so obviously we can't get enough Mexican Democrats.
#####
Feel the burn bitches!
#####
you're a lunatic bruh stop talking.
#####
Dude Bernie won't stop talking about the working class.... You even had him on fox...
#####
Yes Tucker- keep pushing for Centrism, you know the thing from both parties that has rendered HALF the population poor
#####
Dems continue to be Elitists
#####
"Don't want your tax dollars to go to illegal immigrants for health insurance you can't affoed for yourself and your family? Wow! Racist!"

They will devour themselves trying to beat Trump...

#####
CNN or MSNBC would never say ‚ÄúNot everyone in the GOP field is a lunatic‚Äù
#####
A reminder: Yang never once polled above 4.0% among Democrats. Gabbard? Maxed at 1.5%. Delaney, Hickenlooper, and  Ryan? Never hit 1.0%. I think Bullock may have hit 2.0%. Meanwhile, Harris once topped 15% following her put downs of Biden. All this...is the Democratic votership of 2020. A Yang Gabbard ticket would check off all boxes and do it in a way that no one would even notice or care about. I guess that makes them a threat to those so heavily vested in machine politics.
#####

Poor Ryan... ;c
And Tulsi and Yang didnt make it. ;c
*Unhappy noises*

Tim Ryan is unlikable bc he's bought and paid for. Everyone in America who's paying attention knows immigration is a non-issue compared to what we're dealing with.
#####
Tuckers worst take ever lol
#####
And we believe that. Just everyone in it who's vocal is.
#####
Alot of females in that crowd, alot of reeeeeeeeeing
#####
Everyone says yang but is anyone actually going to go out and vote?
#####
YANG is the only candidate with actual policy info on their website. check it yourself
#####
Yang is a radical leftist fraud.
#####
A Dem is a Dem.
#####
Lots of people in the comments that love Tulsi but hate Warren lol. Guys did you even take the time to look up what their policies look like?
#####
The Lefts policies are by and large populist ideas that both left and right wing voters support,  I don't agree with  their stance on immigration but Public Healthcare? A reasonable wage and proper support for the education system are by no means radical or impossible ideals. 

If you go halfway on those measures you end up with bare bones programs like Obamacare.
#####
Anyone else wish somebody would just exicute most of these Hippocratic democratic windbags
#####
LAWS MATTER? TO LIBERALS ? DEMS? SINCE WHEN???? LOLOOL.
#####
It's basically just a bunch of narcissistic rich people that want to rule the world and are always looking for "revolutionary" classes to sweep them into power.
#####
There are a couple of sane ones. Lol
#####
For some reason FOX is like the only news I feel is only for white people lmao. Any other news is more diverse. I'm glad they have yang on this show, pretty odd though because they are for trump but a guy like Yang would be the best option over Trump for everyone(Diverse people/world)
#####
Wowza leninism works way better than the stalinism on gullible caddle masses. Their all tyrants just some are smarter and know how to sweet talk the people on the right to get votes. Trump 2020.

None of you will win Pocahontas. There will be a landslide.
#####
Tucker, you're not fooling everybody. I remember your left wing days at MSNBC wearing bow ties. You are a shill to a lot of us.
#####
Tulsi -- Smartest candidate I have seen with lots of integrity. It would be nice to see her more on the media and listen to what she has to say.
#####
The democrats anti business stance cuts jobs and increases the need for security from the government, thus creating more democrat voters

I dont think he cares that much and is more of a traditional socialist 
Hes even pro gun

I hope Pocahontas gets the ticket, Trump will crush her üòÇ

Based on the comments, I knew Yang was reasonable.

Not everyone in Fox is a propaganda puppet.

Hate tucker Carlson. Love Andrew yang.

They sure seem like it.

Communism thy name is Democratic!
#####
Tucker us a moron sometimes, this is one of those times.
#####
Can we pass a law that makes holding far left ideology a severe crime?
#####
They're all nuts.. People think Yang is smart .. But, a smart person knows it costs 3+Trillion to give people $1,000 a month for free.. Which is foolish & unsustainable
#####
If people like him had been listened to during the last two decades, there would never have been any need for Trump.
#####
Tucker is evolving! ...Hes turning into ...... CUCKER!!!

What an absolute idiot
#####
Why do I have to know you people exist?
#####
Tucker is desperately trying to save his Democrat party. Warren is only half crazy???
#####
Elizabeth warren is a degenerate.
#####
Tucker, you've exposed yourself as an elitist. Quit railing against the only two economic populists. If you're a populist, you ought to endorse Bernie, who is the ONLY ONE that cares about blue collar workers.
#####
Bernie Bernie *BERNIE* , my old foe, my nemesis.

Yang is cool, but i aint down with his healthcare for all position... everything else is alright i guess...
#####
andrew yang is literally the only person that isn't a democrat or a republican i'm so glad we need more people like him running for president
#####
PBS says about Yang: Under Yang‚Äôs plan, 10 percent would be the standard VAT rate, but some goods would be taxed at higher or lower rates: luxury items, such as yachts, would face a higher tax rate, while everyday items, such as groceries, would be exempt from VAT or taxed at a lower rate. (end of excerpt) So the 10 percent isn't really only 10 percent. What about the single Mom who needs a reliable car? Is she going to get taxed at a higher rate for buying a car?
#####
Yangs dividend: Your $1,000 dollars will become $500 or $600 because the Government will tax you on it. Apply his 10% tax on top of goods and you have mega tax. It's not a free dividend if it's going to be taxed. American companies will leave the U.S. because of high taxes like they did before and you will have massive unemployment. He is going to give $1,000 to those who have committed heinous crimes and drug addicts? I don't think they will take that money and get rehabilitated. Why not build shelters for those who do want to get rehabilitated.
#####
Warren would love to be a Gulag boss
#####
I have to admit that I am totally and completely shocked at the lack of integrity in the Democratic party. It's hard to believe that they could blatantly lie/deceive and not be ashamed. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
#####
He twists everything it's amazing
#####
Pocahantas & Bernie are nucking futz!
#####
3:20 I agree with Tucker on the vast majority of issues, yet, even as a fellow conservative, I think it is ridiculous to call his show "nonpartisan." It clearly reflects the views of the Republican Party. Regardless, I enjoy his content and, as mentioned previously, normally agree with him.
#####
If laws mattered, I wouldn't be ..
#####
Warren and Bernie are absolutely nuts!!!!!!!
#####
Isn't a huge point of a democratic debate to debunk or argue against republican talking points? Does Bernie get mad at his wife when she speaks from her point of view on something?
#####
I‚Äôm a republican who would vote for several of these candidates, but there is no way any of them will win.
#####
I wish someone honest with common sense could become president... I dont think I'll see it in my lifetime though : /

Thier ideals are so inhuman  how can normal working class people even wanna vote for them

I think you captured the highlights quite admirably.

If Andrew Yang's policy towards the Apartheid government of Israel was progressive and pro Palestinian rights he'd be up there in my choices. Saw an interview where he had no clue and had nothing serious to say, instead he was pro Israel with no serious critique about the situation.

The UBI will help us transition into an automated society.  Without it we will suffer greatly.  This man must be elected.
#####
I will not vote for him. He cannot hold a candle to Trump 100%.
#####
It was such an amazing experience seeing and meeting Andrew Yang. He went around talking to and taking pictures with people after the ralley even though he had a fund raiser afterwards which required money to get in for that exact thing, being able to meet Andrew. It says a lot about a person thats willing to take the time to meet with people, FOR FREE, when he had every right to leave immediately after the rally. Yang is definitely the man for the job, and the only one with a plan that will help everyone and not just a select group. Yang2020.com #YANGGANG

I am a conservative...but I must say....this guy Yang is the most reasonable fact based liberal that I have ever heard. He is not a race baiter either...he just speaks on real situation.
Like I said ...I am conservative...and I do not have belief in socialist methods of societal improvement, so he does not get my vote. But it would be wise for liberals to push this guy...thats if they want to reach moderates and independents across America.

Yang gang members come from different paths of life. They should high five each other after every Yang speech to recognize each other as americans for a better future!

If the 90% don't vote for him then stop complaining about getting left behind.  Especially white people who feel they are unfairly treated and forgotten.  Trump is taking the money from you while Yang is putting the money back in your pockets where it belongs.
#####
Wake up conservatives. He is a family man and all his policies are for all the American families across the nation. He is the only candidate giving something tangible back to the American people with a Freedom dividend and UNIVERSAL HEALTH care system. He is the only candidate who is in tune with 21st century problems. Let's spread the word to the 25% who are disengaged. Here's to a Yang Gang victory. HUMANITY FIRST. NOT LEFT. NOT RIGHT. FORWARD. üôÇ

Andrew has to also win states like Oregon, Utah, Arizona where population is not necessarily as large as California, but they have electoral votes!

Conservative observer here, solid content and his angle is a good one that could gain some traction. If it doesn't it's because he continues to sound uninspired and impersonal like he did here. People don't know who he his and I feel like he's not taking enough chances to get himself out there.

4:23 that one girl saying "F*ck that" to the statement that Amazon thinks they can automate away a third of their jobs.They are missing the point! you shouldn't be angry at tech companies for using technology... counter-productive and won't stop them from innovating more, that's their jobs! VAT tax will be on them, and that funds the nations UBI, their success is your Freedom Dividend. Instead, that UBI will help communities to look inwards, and find value in what they do, maybe start up their own company too, so they share their success with the nation too! Don't hate people doing their job, especially if they are clever doing it, UBI is there to celebrate their success!

Yang is an incredible moron! If there is that much money than there is zero excuse to ever cut Social Security a dime ever! In fact they could pay back what they cut in the past!  Let the free loader earn theirs like those before them. Fact is those on Social Security can spend it just as good as the free loaders! AND THEY EARNED IT!!!!!!! All this idiot would do is inflate the shit out of our money and destroy those that already earned their Social Security ! As the idiot didn't think to include them. Remember Democrats stole the social security  money to fund their Vietnam war!  There are plenty of unfunded liabilities . Without starting a free bee give away for those that didn't earn it! Maybe yang should try it in Venezuela! After all it was free that put them in the spot they are in now!   Yang is an idiot! LOOKING FOR SUCKERS! And the inflation he would cause would make our money worthless. I am sure China would love this idiots plan. Maybe he works for them! He is trying to kill the golden goose to get all the gold. Funny it never worked in the fairy tail either!  WHAT A SURPRISE!
#####
Andrew Yang is the leader we need. He thinks about the future of America in every aspect which also includes every American people and not just how the rich can make a profit or how the extremely poor can get aid.
#####
Many of the greatest tech minds support the Freedom Dividend. The future is now. Automation has increased so much in my rural hometown of just 13,000. Many jobs are never ever coming back. We need to move America forward. Entrepreneurship will help boost the businesses in small towns like mine.
#####
If you like Yang vote for him and don't let these people talk you out of it. Warren seems to be aligning herself with the DNC and will be pressured by them to keep the status quo. We need someone who is indebted to those that put him into the presidency with small individual donations and support.

Why is it I can only listen to about 4 minutes of Biden, Warren or Harris before a cringing sensation begins to take over but 2 hours of Yang seem like 4 minutes, stimulating the brain and managing to keep me fully focused and engaged. Somebody is clearly touching the right cords with the people. That someone is Andrew Yang!!
#####
I love it!
#####
At the end the presenter says Yang doesn't have 'presence to fill the room' i think this is part of the problem. Yang is the next generation of leadership, less about 'presence' and more data driven, logical and can communicate a ton of seemingly complicated information accurately and succinctly. #YangGang

I can watch Andrew Yang speak all day. You have my vote!!! I pitched in 20$ for your campaign brotha

WTF? naming this video Andrew Yang, yet giving him only 3 minutes out of 22?  Click bait. Unfortunately, it worked.

SO F- IT ! YANG GANG 2020
#####
Ya but polls show mostly people over 45 because millennials don't answer unknown numbers and millennials are now the largest voting block by numbers and many may not be registered yet and so on. It seems like Bidens support is all the much much older population. Yang has overwhelmingly large numbers in the millennial vote, Warren OLDER millennials, Sanders millennials and people who haven't seen enough of Yang, Bernie maybe but Yang is my first choice and I may still vote for him because I don't believe his true popularity is being reflected in the polls but your right he could work on his presence it just doesn't matter to me because he has the best ideas and Trump bores people now in his speeches anyways.
#####
interview of Yang right before talking for 10 minutes about candidates & their chances of winning without even mentioning Yang is frustrating.

in a democracy, on a political talk show, top 3 candidates are the only ones talked about. this is the presidency not a school yard dodge ball pick, find a way to talk through each candidate. maybe leave out questions about turkey legs, focus on the issues, & educate us like you have some agency. 

ends with Yang lacking presence. it's entirely biased. watch the crowd responses at his DNC talk and in general, other interviews or talks. maybe you see him as less than the others who are in the media often?
leave those kinds of things out until you've had a better gauge. it's not accurate "reporting"

listen to Yang's explanations & his expansive list of policies which he backs with genuine humanity. he's done a ridiculous amount of talks with a variety of hosts/reporters.
#####
Yang gets top billing here with only 3 1/4 minutes air time

Yes we are witnessing history #FreedomDividend

I was a mobile engineer for a few years at Samsung Electronics America. In the height of Samsung's growth from Note3 to Galaxy S9, the engineering team got downsized not because of falling profits but because of AUTOMATION. Our department was able to create a proprietary software that automated the testing stage. It simulated thousands of use-cases. I'm telling you. UBI is the future.

Get these damn cars off the road. Imagine how much time the average worker could save, if s/he could hyperloop or take a Maglev train across town to work.

this is such a clickbait, they barely asked him any decent questions and he was shown for less then 4mins in a 22min video with his name on the title.
#####
Can I get amen
#####
His answers made so much sense!  Stop blaming our boys for all thats wrong. We need to put them in better positions to succeed.
#####
Can someone help me find the clip where he talks about the masculinity crisis on one of his more reason speeches.

Every time you listen to AY speak...  you just want to continue listening

I really did not hear anything about any social bribes from Paul Elam.  Certainly not in straightforward english...

#####
Such an important question/answer. Advanced human.
#####
This really show's Yang's uncommon brilliance; He's stopped and asked a question on the fly about an important, but not widely considered issue and can answer the question thoughtfully and succinctly with deep knowledge and a ready command of facts and data, all while other people are buzzing around him demanding his attention as he's being shuttled by his staff to the next engagement. Extraordinary! I'll be deeply saddened if this guy is not elected.

Probably the only decent Democrat running unfortunately hes not part of the plan and will get sidelined and shutdown just like he did at the debate when his microphone was cut

Both parents receiving UBI + free marriage counselling should they need it will go a long way keeping families together.
#####
I wonder if Andrew read Dr. Farrell's book The Myth of Male Power.  It's a real eye opener to the struggles of men.  
I love Andrews concern for mental health and men's and boys rights.  Hopefully he can end alimony and palimony with the Freedom Dividend. Then men might be more willing to marry.

Thank you for pushing the message of dad's important in our children's lives!

I really, really want you to have a podcast with him. I was so impressed with this interview the first time you posted this. 

Please invite him on. You two would have a great conversation.

This country says it's tired of politicians but keeps voting in politicians. Here's a fresh honest man and the mainstream still doesn't support him. You get what you vote for America.
#####

#####
He's damn smart. America will be lucky to have him as a President - a fresh air after a stale 4 years of Trump. He's spot-on about all the troubles that will affect lives in the years to come. It's like he can see the future - future about jobs being taken away by automation and giving $1,000 a month. He'll make lives better definitely. We need someone like him in this world to do something about climate change.
#####
I'm seeing a lot of GOP voters in the comments section that are saying they'd be willing to vote for Yang. I feel like that's because the other Dems are doing the "let's win the nomination by pandering to the left and then pivot to the middle in the presidential campaign proper" which feels disingenuous and turns off a lot of middle voters. Yang meanwhile is simply saying "I see there's a series of big problems, I have some logical solutions that aren't really left or right." One of the most important things about Yang that people aren't talking about enough is that Yang is a post politics candidate. He isn't trying to tear down "opponents," he's just trying to fix things.
#####
OMG! I just realized that Andrew Yang has the same voice as Kermit the Frog!!   I love Kermit the Frog....

The Second he said he would use a PowerPoint presentation at the state of the union address I knew he was not a politician. I‚Äôm very impressed with the topics he is talking about because they are going to be relevant not just for me but for my kids.

The way Anderson and the other interviewers listened so intently made me feel like they had Andrew Yang on as an expert and not just a candidate.  So refreshing to hear him clearly answer any question with such ease and I always learn something new when he speaks. I hope he continues to gain traction and more of a following over the next 12 months. #Yanggang, let's get it!
#####
MATH thing is of course a play on the Asian stereotype, but isn't it also a subtle dig at American stupidity in general?
#####
The facts Mr Yang, just  the facts..oh, continue. ..
#####
I see him as in the ecomonic dept not political, he has to deal with russia, middle east, n korea and china and he has no exp in that, he is good at math but can he make it happen.
#####
I made a video responding to the White Supremacist Racism question asked in the recent Atlanta Debate. My main arguement being about how Andrew Yang is not against blacks after seeing headlines that make Andrew Yang seem like he is taking away from the progression of black equality and rights through his campaign. https://youtu.be/b0BLmKlEwIc

Yang is the only presidential candidate who thoughtfully analyzes the 21st century's problems and intelligently prescribes the 21st century's solutions.  Completely far apart from the crowded field of democrat hopeful candidates.  Andrew Yang's calm demeanor and down to earth mannerism coupling with straight answers as well as pertinent solutions are giving the old America political landscape a new fresh greenfield with a rainbow horizon. That is hope.  Yang for 2020.
#####
Forget about the fact that he's the only one raising these issues;  vote him into office and he'll be the one solving them.

I would love to see Bernie Sanders and Yang as the final two candidates from the Democratic Party. I liked Tulsi but her rampant on Hilton made me feel that same hate and love debate old century technique. Yang didn't utter a word of hate toward Trump he just focused on real problems.
#####
We need a young president who has visions backed by facts and logic instead of lies and drama
#####
Anderson at least was honest enough to say it's over his head.  Imagine a president that can actually think and solve complex national problems.
#####
They all love him because as journalists there is nothing more refreshing than getting straight forward answers to their questions when talking to a politician. And those answers actually make sense so that's a plus.
#####
Yang is going to get the younger vote.
#####
Yang Gang 2020!!

My God .. thank you Andrew Yang for not regurgitating the same old political narrative. Thank you for thinking through real problems and having real solutions .. you have my support even if not as POTUS but anyway you can get close I support ‚úäüèº

I'm still split between Bernie and yang but boy if yang won I would be ecstatic #yanggang2020

I like the way he thinks, but what stops that parent with 5 kids from taking the 1000 and buying crack? We arent getting the same return on investment from our school dollar, as countries in Europe or Asia, but they dont have the 13/90 to take care of.  Third, he's going to get rid of the wall , open immigration, and give everybody 1000.  Dont you think every poor person in the world will head to the USA? Milton Friedman pointed out that you can have a generous welfare system or open borders, but you cant have both. He stated that back in the 70's and it has come to pass. Homelessness wouldnt be a problem if there werent 12 million illegals in the USA today.

1k a month going into my bank would be insane. I think the first thing I'd do is get an investment broker and perhaps open up a secured credit card to establish a better credit score (I'm 22). 1k a month would go a long ways...Thinking of all the investing I could do is mind blowing. However, I also acknowledge that it most likely won't happen, and if it did it would most likely start out for those who meet a wage requirement (sort of like tax brackets)

Andrew is really good.

Well thank God Cooper played nicely even at the expense of making fun of his own intelligence, we should commend him for that compared to some of the other more egotistical media personalities.
#####
All this time, I didn't know that Andrew uses MATH as an acronym for Make America Think Harder. I thought that he actually really liked math.

His intellect, empathy & vision make him the most vote worthy candidate of both parties.

Andrew Yang does not talk about how big his hands are, does not talk about building a wall that separates and divides people, he does not bashes about other candidates, he does not talk wrongly about trump he does say he would do the opposite, and he answers straight to the point and he has the numbers and does the math to see more accurate information. so I'm Canadian but if I was from USA id vote this dude in a heart beat!!

Question for anyone in the comments who would love to help me understand. I‚Äôm ALL for Amazon being taxed and I‚Äôm ALL for UBI but if we taxed companies like Amazon, Google, etc. wouldn‚Äôt the companies start raising up the prices and/or tax us to compensate for the loss they will then have?

Ellen turns down the handshake 1:04 she prefer a hug, this  man must have  done something right
#####
Andrew yang really solves the problem. Life is getting harder everyday for the average American. AI and technology only benefits a subset of the people. Yet these tech companies are using loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Amazon and the likes are killing all the retailers and people are losing jobs. But they are pocketing and making some people hecka rich. But these rich people know how to play tax games and not paying fair share. We really need to implement what Andrew yang propose on universal basic income. And that money need to come from luxury VAT. Otherwise we will face societal problems getting worse. More Homeless people on the streets, more car thefts etc. these problems will exacerbate because people can no longer afford to make rents, have a job. Think about it people. Please I beg you. Even if we are not ready for an asian president, we really need to solve the problems with his proposed solutions. That‚Äôs the only way to go
#####
If I'm president I'd give everyone no questions asked $5,000 a month.

Ellen only invited Andrew to her show because of pressure from Yang Gang. She only interviewed BTS because there was so much commotion from the audience, she was not intending to interview them originally. She is such an ingenuous person. I really dislike her. So out of touch with reality. Seeming to help people out on her show, but it‚Äôs really just a self serving move. She wants to bask in people‚Äôs praises. It‚Äôs not that she actually cares for people.
#####
The akward handshake üòñ

It's so frustrating to see Andrew on shows when there's no time to educate the public on policies. I'm bummed out! I went to his website & actually read his policies and they are amazing but how do we get other people to do this?
#####
"Bruce" Yang is Vatman, the freedom dividend crusader

Hey Oprah  let's discuss inspiring figures ..like a virtual nobody who wasn't taken seriously declaring he wants to be President. Look at where Andrew is at .

His healthcare plan is worse than Mayor Pete's....

Some of these girls LOOOOOVVEEEE Ellen that one at the end was literally shaking... She sure knows how to make ermüí¢üòâ
#####
As a software engineer, I like that Yang understands that software dominates every part of our lives and many people don't really understand that. We need this type of president that understands this and that will prepare people for this and have a system implemented in place for this. People might think he's nuts but he is so right. We need forward-thinking politicians these days for our ever-evolving technology.
#####
Ever since Yang started talking at all I instinctively saw he was a corporate Trojan Horse Gig Economy, anti-progressive.
#####
As an overseas Chinese, I have a complex feeling about Andrew Yang's rise. On one hand, I wish him to win! Because I am an Asian. I feel proud if the US has its first Asian American President. On the other hand, I don't wish him to win. Because if he becomes the president, China'll get no chance in the game. He is spot on for way too many things! With other politicians, the US will win all the battles but eventually lose the war with China. If Andrew Yang becomes the president, I will have to believe that maybe God truly blesses America!
#####
Cool! Time to count how many people joined Yang Gang--assuming most Yang Gang have seen this video and the Joe Rogan show...
#####
An Asian president would be cool
#####
God I love me some Andrew Yang!
#####
Andrew opening his mouth while feeding the whipped cream is the best thing.
#####
his idea is worth attention
#####
Yang mind of a child
#####
Ellen reaction dosn't look so good. She should atleast giv 2-3 mins to let him speak i gurantee he dosn't need more than that.
#####
To get this great man a real shot of the presidency alot of regular people who are not politically active will have to get about championing him to everyone they know. I'm not American but I follow your politics very closely and his vision  is so important for the security of the entire world. If America fails, and it is faltering, we are all in trouble.
#####
I love you I want to come to your show but I dot have any excess to Come
#####
You know what's incredible about Andrew Yang? His message resonates with the sense of human life that was left out of the economy's one sided measuring system. I'm all the way in Africa in country called Botswana and I would vote for him, YANG GANG you better push this beacon of hope to the very top. Best of luck
#####
where in his online..is his actual health plan in writing?????

To all the white Americans watching this - ANDREW M. YANG is just as American as Donald J. Trump, as American as you and your immigrant ancestors. Period.

I'm trying to envision a highly intelligent, civilized, data driven person like Andrew Yang debating a person like Donald Trump. Any guesses as to whether Donald Trump will try to convince Americans that Andrew Yang wasn't born in this  country or poke fun at his ethnicity?

Hello Ellen I am from India , I am your biggest fan from India 
The Ellen show is the best show in the world you and only you are my best youtuber

I'd donate all my $$ to get Andrew Yang to be my president if I live in the US. You'd get back more than your $$ back from the $12K/yr for the rest of your life. America you got one shot, don't lose.

Honestly my hand is getting tired from thumb's upping every single comment in the thread...Yang 2020!

No one watched it because people watch Netflix and YouTube nowadays. The debates get recognition on our popular social media websites not age old television programming.
#####
YANG GANG MATH 2020
#####
I consider myself an independent voter.... Of all the dem candidates, I really like Andrew Yang's well articulated and intelligent explanation of why the UBI plan for all legal American citizens (over the age of 18) is the way to go to preserve and ensure America's flourishing future....  But I don't like Yang's stance on abortion (he's for it) and wanting open borders among other key important issues. I sure wish POTUS45 would put all Americans 1st by investing in her citizens and implement a freedom dividend (UBI)! üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏ .. if the $ was put back into the hands of the citizens,  there will be less "MISmanagement" of welfare money by gov workers (with the freedom dividend most welfare programs can be ended),  A UBI would save US taxpayer billions of $$$ as just a dividend of $1k a month,  most poor would not feel desperate and go to drugs, prostitution or theft to get $ for the basic necessities. And Prisons would be less likely to hold as many people as the UBI will help sustain them. Another better idea,  is to buy land with apartment style buildings on them and let the poor and homeless live in them and self regulate their community. Ban drugs and if they are found to have drugs will lose their apartment, unless they can clean up. These apartments will be free for the poor under a certain income as long as they abide by clean (no drugs, no violence) rules. Then turn the community in a non-profit and ask for donations and support. But key is to have the property of the apartment building or tiny home with zero taxes (paid in full)  and eventually allow the residents to own the little home or apartment.
#####
Trump 2020, UBI is foolish. "Enacting a UBI that pays $US10,000 to every US adult would distribute about $US2.5 trillion in benefits each year. That‚Äôs roughly 75% of the federal government‚Äôs 2018 revenues. To fund a UBI program of this size, Congress would need to pass massive tax increases or spending cuts.

Some proponents of UBI would fund the program, at least in part, by disbanding existing safety-net programs. This would be a disaster."
#####
If we are going to give yang a platform....how about we start exposing him for being an imposter.  He is not a progressive.  He doesn't deserve to be on a democratic ticket. He is a mild mannered trump. He holds no values that real progressives care about. He throws out empty slogans that progressive use while pandering to corporations dismantling any hope for the poor and marginalized communities.  His ideas are not new. They are conservative statistics quo, corporations over ppl. He just wraps them up in progressive slogans. His words are empty. Aoc is truly validated calling his UBI scam a trojan horse. His ideas are trumps America as they are today only he wants to eradicate government assistance for the poor to give people a $1000. Who will pay for that?? Poor.  It's not fresh and new to feed the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  Its regressive the complete opposite of progressive.
#####
Just like the debates, only one sentence of this whole video was related to yang
#####
We gotta spank every trump live stream!!!! We have to keep it moving!!!

The reason no one saw the debate is cause we're all too damn busy working our asses off to stay alive. I think capitalism is definitely our current best system, but it has been deteriorating lately and is at risk of becoming either fascist or communistic; neither of these options have been beneficial if we're going by the books of history.

Andy watched "the impeachment." What a dope.
#####
The entire debate system they have is just who can insult the other persons ideals so much in the least amount of time that the candidate being insulted doesn‚Äôt have enough time to explain and defend themselves. The entire presidential election is just a show to distract the people and make them think that they‚Äôre vote actually does anything but help to put the next fat pig in his ivory tower in the White House. All the while the people are getting fucked in the ass by big companies and having all their money taken from them while getting fed pills to make them think that they‚Äôre life isn‚Äôt so terrible in order to not blow the governments cover for how long they‚Äôve been rigging the system against the people and for big companies and politicians
#####

Andrew Yang: "Hold my beer".

Andrew Yang hit the 2M dollar campaign donation goal by November 30. Right on the dot. 
     1.5M dollars were generated in the last 2 days, with people donating as little as 1 dollar. Yang has truly become the People's Candidate. Amazing! 
       Yang's ideas and policies are now beginning to clearly amd strongly reaonate all across the Country.

#####
You look like chandler
#####
Get him on your show.  Not just talking about him.  The American people will love you for that.
#####
For sure MSNBC doesn't want American to know about Yang that's why they gave him very short time and also asked these stupid questions that didn't even relate to his campaign.
#####

#####
these muti national muti billion dollar corporations should pay us for our data they use to market to us
#####
What do  some Yanks see in Biden, Warren and even Sanders ? 
Biden has no plans. He want to turn coal miners into coders.  Warren lies and shows ignorance of the real issues of why people are losing their jobs and Sanders has half-baked plans with his  job guarantee and wealth tax.  
US has too many old frt politicians who have outlive their usefulness. It is  time for a term limit to get rid of all these old frts.
#####
This  guy is a super genius
#####
Andrew Yang has it right UBI but he is not the only ones to back this concept. It may surprise you to learn that the Federal Reserve and it was discussed at the at the bilderberg group by Guy Standing. If was discussed there the infamous secret meeting of the world elite, then you can count on it coming to fruition.

When economist Guy Standing first advocated a universal basic income (UBI) ‚Äì a regular unconditional sum paid to all adults regardless of employment status ‚Äì he was considered quixotic (where quixotic is a synonym for ‚Äúa crackpot‚Äù). When his book The Precariat ‚Äì which identified an emerging class of people whose lives were diminished by short-term and zero hours contracts ‚Äì was published in 2011.
Guy Standing ted talk about UBI is needed:
https://youtu.be/nnYhZCUYOxs

Check out the linked article below:
https://thegreatworkdecoded.com/knowledge-base/universal-basic-income/
#####
I figure there will be a time in the future where the debate will on HOW MUCH to increase the UBI and not IF we should have one. Yang is just ahead of the curve right now. And one day we will all read it in the books that Yang championed an old idea (Dr. MLK) and won the elections. üòäüëçüèº
#####
I was laughing at him too first time i heard of his 1000 dollars "Give away" until he mentioned automation.
#####
Yang 2020!
#####
As much as i love Trump i am starting to like this guy a lot.
#####
The first 5 minutes says it all.
What millions of poor, brown and disenchanted voters feel are the truths of our capitalistic "democracy".
Humanity First !
#####
Yang gang!!!!!
#####
Can someone point me to how we address property prices rising once everyone has UBI?
#####
Yang is superb but has no chance cuz established Dems will absolutely not let him be nominee, then any one of the rest will be crushed by Trump undoubtedly
#####

#yanggang2020
#####
Andrew Yang is the ONLY man with a plan to abolish Income Tax. AND, the only candidate that shared all of his policy plans for the world to scrutinize BEFORE serving. World loves his brilliance!

A real contrast to Trump promising to share his plans AFTER serving. His only plan was to increase government spending to increase GDP to say the economy is growing, by pointing at GDP and ignoring debt.
#####
We need a normal human being as President. The rest are coo coos.  Freedom dividend for working class living paycheck to paycheck and disabled people getting government money, both are the same.  Both put money back in to economy and both can live a little better, reducing stress.
#####
Love for Yang to have the opportunity to explain his proposed policies that would ultimately benefit ALL Americans instead of just a few.  My vote in 2020 goes to Andrew Yang!
#####
Just heard of him today...ü§©  now binge watching all his interview videos!
Wise man with a heart‚ù£  hope he wins!üôè
#####
Awwww shiet a smart President? Something we need.
#####
Andrew Yang just wants to help people and this interviewer is trying to convince him not to lol smh
#####
I'm sorry but the fact that he is wearing a "math" pin is absolutely hilarious.
#####
Can you guys give me American citizenship so I can vote for Yang too?
#####
Yang, Don't laugh, you look like a fool. That's a stupid laugh.
#####
Hey, there's still some problems. If I had a green card in america, can I send half of this money to my mommy in China?
#####
IMO, the biggest positive of UBI will be the strengthening of American values and will catalyze creativity in our country. 
Think of it at the most basic level, most people with children want to spend more time with their kids and be positive influences but the constant boot on our throats from bills prevents us from going to our kids little league games, helping them with school, riding bikes around the neighborhood together. UBI would strengthen our families bc we wouldn‚Äôt be so stressed about next months rent. 
A stressed household absolutely has an effect on a growing child. Stress from bills can create domestic violence, alcoholism, drug use, etc to escape this vicious circle we have created under our current system of life. UBI will fundamentally let Americans finally pursue things they hold more dear to them and thus will create a happier, less stressed, and equal society.
#####
Everytime I hear Andrew Yang talk,  he sounds like our President. Everytime I hear Biden, Warren, and Pete Buttgay talk, they sounds like dumb dumbs with no real visions how to help the poor, average Americans. Yang2020
#####
#AndrewYang2020
#####
This guy thinks like a tech billionaire turned philantrophist.. ohh wait..
#####
I hate it when the interviewers basically say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt win‚Äù. SCREW THEM!!  Let‚Äôs show em!
#####
Finally! Someone who knows what‚Äôs really up!  AND who can actually unite this country!  I am so sick of the divide!
#####
Simply the best candidate!  #Yang2020 #ISupportYang #YangGang!
#####
Spending less money and high effectiveness make successful things and high effectiveness do more things ---------- Andrew yang
#####
Robot automation can quickly end the need for immigration workers.
#####
Thanks for Andrew yang's zoning law policy for tiny houses project and shipping container home help all Americans low income families and homelessness people to liberate from city high house rental and high house prices.
#####
12:55  I've never been called scrappy before I've always wanted to start my own business
#####
Give thumbs up to Yang but thumbs down to MSNBC.
#####
Share this video people. Share this video.
#####
Only it isnt a dividend.¬† It is a redistribution of wealth - primarily from the upper and middle class - that will be funded by a VAT - which is a tax on consumers, not on businesses.

Dont want to feel like your efforts are under valued by the economy? 

Then find a way to make your efforts valuable.

Dont expect people to pay you to clean your own house and raise your own kids.

There is a guy on YouTube who made a 7 minute video that earned him $33,000.00 in ad revenues in one year.

https://youtu.be/2CGj65_julo

Have A Plan If You Plan To Have.
#####
Yang, you are stretching the truth to fit your narrative. 

UBI has not had the historical support that you claim.

https://youtu.be/VtBt2OSL2Mw

https://youtu.be/9DHKKPTxogY
#####
A man of vision. What more can you ask for?
#####
Captain Kirk never carried a wallet
#####
UBI will pay for the drugs of millions of addicts escaping the mediocrity and pain of their lives.
Choice #1:   Work hard, struggle, sweat, to get skills to compete in a ever more difficult job market using robots and computers.
Choice #2:    Use UBI income to run away to the forest, live basic life and save money in the bank.
Choice #3:   Become a drug addict all expenses paid.
   You know the people and the choices they will make.   Its obvious.
#####
Automation is no joke you guys, it is seriously going to wipe out so many jobs. This is only the beginning. I really think this guy is good for the future of our economy.
#####
Simplified rationale of Yang‚Äôs UBI : our personal data is universally monetized. Yet we have no monetization personally. UBI would allow us to monetize what is being harvested by organizations.
#####
"Human Centered Capitalism" is another way to say "Socialism">¬† Yang is a left wing nut job!¬† Glad his support is under water
#####
Notice yang loves Alaska as his utopia? He lies about it every day. Alaska is cutting the oil payments ( it has nothing to do with UBI). Yang is a coward like all the other 2020 democrats. https://youtu.be/VtBt2OSL2Mw
#####
I hate to break it too you, but his math sucks, his assumptions are wrong, his outcomes are false etc. ubi just failed in Ontario and Finland. You cannot tax your way to wealth democrats. Socialists etc. https://youtu.be/VtBt2OSL2Mw
#####
His ideas will move this country forward with noone left behind. Human centered capitalism.
#####
This guy's gun fire questions being fired back with cannon balls.  Andrew Yang for President.

Facts that show how effective the $1000 Freedom Dividend can really be a game changer for majority of Americans: 

1. 4 in 10, that's 40% of Americans can't cover a $400 emergency expense. https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html 
2. An average American household has over $8,000 credit card debt. https://fortune.com/2018/12/10/american-household-credit-card-debt/ 

3. 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck by paycheck. https://thedailycoin.org/2019/01/10/78-percent-of-americans-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-including-many-government-workers-affected-by-the-shutdown/ 

4. 1 in 4 Americans have student loan debt, i.e. approximately 44.7 Million people. Average student loan debt amount = $37,172. Average student loan payment = $393/month. https://www.nitrocollege.com/research/average-student-loan-debt 

5. Successful dividend program has been implemented in Alaska with oil money since 1982. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/13/16997188/alaska-basic-income-permanent-fund-oil-revenue-study 

6. Dividend from the nation's wealth is not only for the poor but for all citizens, and that would make it a true dividend and not a government handout or a social program for the poor... and therefore, not stigmatized the funding. People who don't need the dividend can always donate their shares to charities of their choices, or others causes with their humanity and altruistic desires, and this has been proving with positive effects in the society in general and specifically in the case of Alaska. 

Freedom Dividend - Humanity First - Andrew Yang 2020 and Beyond.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
I like thoughtful  leaders. Even if I disagree with them.  Mr, Yang seems to have command of his ideas, and the ability to articulate them in a understandable way. Intelligence needs to be appreciated  so much more in this country. We went from Black to white, let try going from dim-wit to thoughtful.
#####
Capitalism isn't "immoral," it's "amoral."
#####
*I was just wondering if...*
(-VP- Mike Pence) is related to the founder Thomas Pence?
#####
He needs to be more critical of Socialism.
#####
Capitalism with a human face? Doesn't exist. It's a fraud. Capitalism, by definition, cares about making money circulate, like a vortex. This is why finance exists, so that money can circulate without the need of any substantial happening. But if someone loses a bet in finance at Wall Street, a million of people loses their job on the other side of the world. That's capitalism, it always has been so an it always be. 
If you care about working people, for the people who actually make your country rich - vote for Sanders <3
#####
I‚Äôm voting for Yang not because UBI I‚Äôm voting for Yang because he smart,  he cares about automation and the future of our kids
#####
He's got my vote
#####
The problem with Yang is that he is running for the wrong party. He has too little appeal to the hard democratic base, and his policies regarding AI, China and privacy would very much suit the republican party. In a 1 on 1 primary battle with Trump, I feel like he could win over a lot of the young voters on the republican side. He is being drowned out amongst a sea of democrats on the left.

08:14 I'm sorry, I thought USA's motto was "Freedom" not "Arbeit macht frei". When did even socialists start demanding that everyone needs to work to survive, to feed themselves and pay the bills.. etc The UBI gives you true freedom. $12K/year covers the basics: food, rent, bills... it takes the edge off, enough to survive. If you wanted anything extra, the luxuries: a holiday, fancy gadgets, then you will have to work for it - the way it should be.
#####
This isn't capitalism, its called communism/socialism.
#####
watch out for inflation when you applied this UBI
#####
this guy is everwhere on YouTube
#####
Don't underestimate what Yang is doing.

The media wouldn't tell you, but he is waking up the silent majority that feels left out by red vs blue.
#####
Wtf....I clicked it thinking its was Andrew Ng the AI expert and Coursera founder from Stanford.
Edit: It may seem racist but they just look similar and have same first name.
#####
UBI, if financed only by VAT, is a balanced-budget income redistribution mechanism that costs the government nothing for a closed economy. UBI 
like water flow in a pool comes out of one course and then returns back to the other but the level of water stays steady. It levels the playfield for sure and makes the economy sustainable. UBI, if not this time, will eventually be implemented.

Looks like this interviewer has not putted for a while.
#####
Andrew Yang must be nominated. If you believe in his message, don't say "he won't win". VOTE for his nomination, or else YOU will be the reason he doesn't win.
#####
I like human capitalism, but I still dont like UBI.
#####
So then legislate AI from not taking away an unnecessary amount of human jobs?
#####
More manufacturing jobs have been lost from outsourcing overseas ever since 2001 when China joined the WTO. 4 million in fact. Also, 8 million jobs are taken away from Americans right now from illegal immigrants. Yang is talking about a false flag when the problem is already here. Germany has twice as many industrial robots as the US yet manufacturing supporters 1 out of every 4 German jobs. To surmise, the problem isn't automation, its outsourcing and illegal immigration. Corporate greed wins from both, the American workers loses.
#####
Interviewer: "....you're not really ready for...." Clueless. Full Stop....it, fool; 21st century, per se unprecedented, hence, please.

Dude thinks like a socialist and talks like a capitalist.

#####
These socialists ideals are pretty much how Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Norway have been living for decades. Well, guess the most developed, peaceful and well-educated region on earth?
#####
Giving people the option of either food stamps or other govt programs and cash is a terrible idea because there are parents out there who would take the money and use it for addiction rather than provide for their children, leaving them without any real assistance
#####
Yang is an option for me... Yet his supporters are... Very afraid of discussion & condescending(?) (The ones on twitter are... Aggressive / abrasive to say the least) Perhaps I met the wrong enclave? Perhaps I'm used to the kindness from a base I'm currently in... 

Can't be sure, anyways, Good luck Yang Gang, if you fall down & need a hand, #NotMeUs welcomes a hand. :)
#####
I agree with Yang, but people need some radical changes in some areas now!, but as things stabilize it would be easier to introduce positive change easier!, People like Bernie and Warren know that you always ask for double of what you expect to get,,,,,
#####
Tang is definitely a Centrist but a realistic one at that!
#####
Andrew never makes it about himself even when he is running for president and he never plays the race card!

So stupid that he has to play the race card.  If you don't want racism then don't be racist.
#####
The DNC removed Andrew Yang from the debate because they said he had low poll numbers. And yet they let one other billionaire candidate in the debate who polls lower than Mr. Yang.¬† As i have been saying the DNC does not want Yang and now you are all seeing how they keep him out
#####
Really?  Only of color?  What about Pocahontas?  Harvard claimed she was first woman of color in their school.  Don't play that card Dang Yang.  You so smart.  You know better.  Ain't white a color?  Never thought we would hear a high IQ Asian talk about color. You so smart, why don't you have more people who like you?  You ain't gonna make it Dang Yang.  Start a business and get real rich.  Then try and be attractive.

Chinese are not a minority group, there are over a billion of them in China, not to include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Myanmar, Africa, and of course, all of the Americas in the New World.

Learn more about Andrew at yang2020.com !!! 

We need someone that will make a REAL difference for our country !!!

"Person of color?!!" Not enough tho! Look...this dude is using the story of another culture to represent his people in America-to advance in a system...

"people of color, person of color,blah, blah, blah."

#####
We will surprise everyone when the voting happens.
#####
Don't worry....the DNC will get rid of him.¬† Money talks and the Asian walks.
#####
*God I hate Van Jones. Who gives a flying fuck that an unfunny comedian like Donald Glover supports Andrew Yang? And the whole adage Yang Gang is incredibly annoying. I like Andrew Yang and support him but what is the newsworthy angle of this video? Absolutely nothing. Just trash.*
#####
I'm pretty sure Trump is gonna be reelected 2020.
#####
Did CNN delete Yang‚Äôs closing statement from this YouTube channel
#####
Yang dishin insightful facts while at 2:45 homeboy photog is taking closeup shots of a fukin prism for some goddam reason
#####
Yang 2020
#####
Shut the FK up. Asian isn't colored. Keep virtue signalling numbskull.
#####
"Candidate of color" lol
Trying to ride on the coat tails of african Americans.
There are more chinese with 500 million to spare than white people on planet earth combined.
Asians are the exact opposite of a "minority".
#####
Andrew Yang should be proud and work harder to win the debate. His skin color is  beautiful  he should embrace it with pride. His brain is the same color as all of the other candidates. He can use it wisely.
#####
I really like A. Yang
#####
MAJORITY white AMERICANS are not voting for a ASIAN,  BLACK PPL probably, but definitely not white ppl.
#####
(The CNN dude looks like he could be Gruesome Newsom's bro.)
#####
--Yeah; so what?¬†¬†

(Of course it‚Äôs now obvious Yang will be playing the race card ‚Äî which, as we all know, is a bit tricky being an Asian-American given, as a demographic, "those people" tend to place tops in income, academic achievement, and recent property acquisition.)
#####
Andrew yang making CNN great again.
#####
shout out to the yang gang
love you guys
you are a force to be reckon with
#####
Honestly Trump 2020
#####
God damn the media got so hung up on Andrew calling the impeachment a waste of time. Almost like they shifted all their eggs into the impeachment basket because it generates them so much clickbaity revenue and that if impeachment goes down the drain it‚Äôll seem like they were just trying to fill their pockets instead of doing their duty of informing the American people. But that isn‚Äôt true, right?
#####
Yanglinks.com if y'all need more information on Yang's policy positions.
#####
I don't know if I'm exactly correct on everything I'm saying but I researched a little and this is my opinion. 

His policies sound good but you have to be even more weary about anything sounding good. What I came to understand is that if Andrew Yang becomes the President of America, he will be the leader through the gateway to a social credit system. 

Andrew wants "Human Centered Capitalism". It's basically Socialism and Socialism doesn't work well with money. At first he says something I agree with. Humans are important than money, which is absolutely right. But then:

"The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar"
 "We need to make the markets serve us rather than the other way around"
"We need government leaders who are truly laser-focused on the public interest above all else and will lead companies to act accordingly"

The upside to his campaign kind of sounds like he wants to get more people more leverage when it comes to jobs. One of the concerns is paying everyone equally. To pay everyone equally, everyone will need to get less money. That really doesn't pan out too well with prices of our necessities increasing every year. Especially when regulators will also be more strict when it comes to a corporations excess profit.
¬† 
¬†¬† What is weird is how he refers to the corporations as if they are horses and regulators having to rein their excesses in. Then says "The government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value". Here I'm guessing the government is the owner of all the ranches. This is good for people who have the same values. However, I don't think that everyone really does. 

¬† "Regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position". That sounds like many corporations can face dramatic changes. Excess money can be used to reinvest into corporations immediately. But with this being a socialist method, the market needs to serve the people. As a result, this can just hurt the corporations. Regulators would need to be at the top of their game all the time. Additionally, they will be blocked out of an opportunity within the private sector. Their relationships with private sectors will become stagnant. 

¬† So now we have to ask how we affected by these regulators. With timebanking, they would be required to be more critical of how they regulate buisness and¬† determining the value of a Time Credit. They would have to make it fair while evaluating the skill set and social value of each person. People getting paid accordingly will be very rough. I assume Time credits won't fully replace curremcy. If this is to become popular people should keep this in mind: will there be FREE classes to ensure that we all have the skills to acquire time credits? On one hand, there won't be any because that takes time. People need to get paid to instruct, vast resources need to be acquired for the facilities usage and space will either need to be rented or constructed. Now let's say the government creates a loophole(cause they're the government), goes with this idea and pays out whatever amount of money to get this done. This has potential because job openings will increase through timebanking. However, there is still a drawback here. If they did that, I'm sure the government would tax us significantly to recoup losses and inevitably create a time credit monopoly. You have to account for a person's ingenuity, transportation, possible relocation for living quarters, etc. Even if people become like minded to make living easier, where would the money come from to support the people if timebanking becomes more prevalent or possibly our stable? 

¬† Andrew's campaign is meant to help out everyone do more than just get by. If people are expected to work multiple positions and are rewarded by meeting social expectations, they will be under pressure. Not only that, but what exactly will be acceptable in terms of social value? If you want to say that humans are more important than money, then you have to keep morale going. If morale is inconsistent, you will definitely have unhappy people. Which can cause inefficiency and lead to termination or people quitting their jobs. Here is where we see the downside of maximizing well being meeting the demand of it's controllers. 

¬† Andrew also believes in the advancement of technology and it's uses. With AI, we can have a system that allows us to see how reliable a person is before trading hours with them. Similar to how the Social Credit System is in China. But with technology advancing, it can easily put people out of jobs. With a "wearable device that monitors your vital signs"¬† that also starts "recommending occasional behavior changes", the world probably wouldn't even need as many doctor's. Which would be unfortunate for those who spent money and put in effort for a medical degree. But this may be untrue and I can possibly be proven wrong.

¬† Speaking of doctors, Andrew says he wants to reform the state of our health care system. He acknowledge's the amount of people who don't have healthcare, the difficulty paying off expenses, the job lock that people face to keep their health care plan and doctors not being able to properly help people. Now with more people being expected to trade hours doing work for credit, you will risk more people getting sick. This results in more doctors being needed; especially if we consider doctors needing to spend more time to give proper care and more people obtaining health a care plan. Better tests, technology and medicine means more resources and more money. So whether there be more or less doctors, they will continue to struggle with proper compensation. Thus, people will continue to struggle with healthcare and may face debt because of it.

¬† Lastly, let's talk about one of Andrew's strongest points: the Guaranteed Income.¬†Yang quotes many people who support this type of thinking. Initially, I did think it was a good idea and many others did as well. He wants to give every American $1,000/mo so they can add flexibility to their living situation. Things may be good for his first year or so but it'll be rough after that. The reason I say that is because it sounds like he somewhat believes in the Free Market Policy. To my understanding, the Free Market Policy allows financial freedom to obtain innovation within a country. However, a country has to cut corners in order to fulfill its objectives. This is the same policy Donald Trump follows during his presidency. With the pressure of more responsibility for the regulators, it will be impossible to advance using that policy without consequences. Enabling welfare throughout the country, starting the use of time banking and tax increases mean living will become more expensive. Resulting in people becoming dependent on welfare and struggling for time credit throughout his term as president. It will become likely that also America will face an economic crash due to it's large demand for resources and it's inability to pay off debt. Effectively making it a third world country.
¬† 
¬† That concludes my take on his policies. I may be wrong about some things but we'll have to see.
#####
He is Asian we don‚Äôt need a Asian president 
Us soldiers didn‚Äôt fight for America to vote in someone Asian 

Why is a Asian so interested in us politics and being president 

You people keep playing it cool knowing dam well he can‚Äôt be trusted Democratic Party can‚Äôt be trusted

Taiwan japan or China
 It donT matter 
They can‚Äôt be trusted as us president 
Period

In my eyes it‚Äôs a matter of national security 


We don‚Äôt have to prove nothing to no one if we don‚Äôt want an Asian president just accept it and move forward
America doesn‚Äôt have time for that shit we don‚Äôt have to appease someone just because they say to 

It‚Äôs not worth it
#####
Always about Race or Minorities, right Liberal MSM? The poor oppressed. Sheesh. This horse died so long ago.
#####
I actually want him to run as an independent. Even if it splits the dems it will at least show the country the choice does not always have to come down to the lesser of two evils.
#####
Meng for Yang 20/20!!!
#####
There goes the dems part by by
#####
Lol a rapper hahahahha so a singer wow has the yang's back wow one step back
#####
China is not a threat that doesnt exist it's just a talking point
#####
Disagree with Yang on this one. There are asians who struggle in this country.  Specifically south east Asians tend to struggle more than east Asians economically. Many Cambodian, Hmong and Lao Americans struggle with poverty today. Many of these Asian groups were also refuged in impoverished violent neighborhoods when coming to the US in the 80s.
#####
CNN sure hates white people.
#####
I really like this guy! He really relates to the middle class.. And that 1 a month could go towards retirement and that's what alot of people are lacking nowadays
#####
Person of color? Yeah Asian Americans are the wealthiest and most educate people in America today. Shut the hell up with this trash.
#####
Now he's a racist. Go back to Taiwan. How many white politicians are there in taiwain? You're a fool.
#####
re;  Yang Election Gimmick - Don't be deluded fools drunk on false promises by someone talking bullshite,  trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.. $1,000 a month money will get spent in the consumer market and cause inflation, because producers will raise their prices due to increased demand, before they even bother expanding production to meet that demand, by raising capital to invest in new productive capacity. Thus higher prices for the same economic basket lead to devaluation of the dollar.  Economics 101.  It's is an election gimmick, little more. If you'eve ever run a business you would realise that raising prices is the easiest way to generate more revenue and profit,  in the face of increasing demand, without incurring additional manufacturing overheads. Thus you are essentially increasing your profit margins simply by increasing prices and those higher prices will be sustainable due to the  higher consumer demand. It ultimately means this election gimmick is all for nothing, other than cheap votes. Too easy. This dude is shifty as hell and can't be trusted by voters. Massive crooked con job.  The sad part is,  that there are many people dumb enough to fall for it.
#####
Play that race card Yang ,it won‚Äôt help you socialist, communist politicians ,people got you figured out.
#####
I am Asian and I give zero f**ks about the race. Policy is more important that race, as it should be.
#####
very very big about HK index cfds...Keep close watch

I love when these Democrat candidates say there‚Äôs no diversity left on the stage. They‚Äôre basically calling democratic voters racist
#####
Omg üòÇ they were foaming at the mouth with questions about impeachment after he laid out all of the real life struggles of Americans. I have to laugh to cope, but this was honestly sad to see. At least Van tried to get back to a real topic
#####
You will never see a Democrat more angry than when a person of color sides with a Republican. Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance, inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked so viscously and mercilessly each time, like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party? 


Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power. 


It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts, they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.  If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch? 


The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right? 
If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate. 


Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.  


By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.  Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?

#####
I feel the minorities that Andrew came across just didn't feel as strong as a candidate as Yang. So they bowed out to give the minorities a clear indication on who they want to run as the democratic candidate.
#####
Yang is literally the only candidate that reengage the Obama coalition and I don‚Äôt think Democrats realize that. Go look back to the 2008 Campaign and tell me I‚Äôm wrong.
#####
Exactly what Yang was saying. He's focusing on real American issues and these reporters keep reverting back to "impeachment, impeachment!"
No one cares! That's the problem with OUR media. 
We care about solving the issues that really matter to us
#####
Will Yang take on the greed that is ruining this country? It‚Äôs one thing to give everyone $1000 - taking on the fossil fuel industry, big pharma, agribiz... that‚Äôs a different story. I like Yang. I just wonder if he‚Äôs going to actually steer this ship (which clearly he‚Äôs attempting to do via the freedom dividend).
#####
I hate when Asians call themselves people of color
#####
I'm pretty sure Jews are a minority ...

He's soooooooo sad,while using the race card!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a liberal,always keep the race card in your back pocket.Never know when it might come in handy!Liberals are all the same.

And the only one who makes rational sense

Good to see yang n Donald on the same line

You can always tell when a Democrat speaks.
They blame others they speak of race and usually start by insulting someone...
I'm Jay and I APPROVE OF THIS MESSAGE.. HOW ABOUT YOU?

To witness Yang‚Äôs growth in just the last six months alone is incredible. #YangGang ü§ôüèº

Yang is the hero we need in this divided country. Seriously. Do the right thing america. Mend the divide.
#####
What color is he?
#####
If Yangs skin is white, he'll win..
#####
Remember yang is a offspring of Taiwanes parents. If he where to the be elected. The ccp will be spoked by him because he's a descendant of a Taiwanese family. We vote for yang and hopefully China will leave Hong Kong alone.

YANG IS THE KING

its not disappointing to observe democrats try to explain their cultural insecurities and mentally defective demands to feel as if they can represent their own sense of fairness as it applies to the partys image, its pathetic. but in that pathetic reality of desperate democrat demands to be perceived according to what they want to not do speak for, yang is the second best example. behind black mayor pete. sorry to say chief warren and her tribe are less diverse for marketing purposes than joe and his white kids, but joe can play drums too.
#####
If Andrew yang is president Trump's wall is still gonna be built so what's the point of trump being president?
#####
6:03 when he said"they ain't got no money" I felt that

I switched from Republican Party to vote for Yang!  And I know for sure there‚Äôs a lot more than just me doing exactly the same thing!  Would love to see the numbers IRT üòÅ

You can‚Äôt tell me our politics isn‚Äôt rigged everyone INCLUDING REPUBLICANS love him when I tell them to look him up YANG 2020

I don‚Äôt like democrats but the way he‚Äôs getting censored while having good ideas is crazy to me
#####
"although you really could add women in that" lol he thinks women are a minority. Really sad to see Yang playing the race card.
#####
He has low chances of winning, Bernie and Biden are the top ones, didn‚Äôt even know bts was gone run for president.
#####
Literally never played the race card but it's ironic the only other poc up there is supporting the other poc. Everyone else asking dumb ass questions typical of establishment media. I'm voting Yang2020
#####
Yang seems like the type of guy who‚Äôs been well rounded and exposed to my problems and experiences in life! He connects to the issues directly. Most candidates just want votes for them and to win. Yang is actually picking up dirt and sand, just to help restore America and better for the future.
#####
Would a President who does TED talks be better than someone who actually announces reforms and then enacts them? I think Yang is more than just a TED talker.

I really wish Pete Buttigieg would also do more podcast interviews.

I prefer bernie, but I still like yang.

Extremely small chance he will actually win, but hope he does
#####
I onestlly think trump going two win again there's just two many accidents for the democratic side
#####
There are over 7 million in the United States that are millionaires, what would giving them a $1,000 a month do? Dumbest idea in political history
#####
What is he laughing at?

This guy has ideas that wouldn‚Äôt work

$15k is the official poverty level of the US, not sure how bribing people with $12k a year is seen any less than placating to poor people with someone else's money, as much as it is insolvent and laughed at on the main stage. The US is already 23 trillion in debt, but handing out cash is going to solve the poverty problem with no unintended consequences.

Yang is a systems thinker. A goal centered approach defined by meaningful metrics! Got my vote

I just learned who he is less than a week ago. Now I'm registered as a Democrat just so I can vote in the primaries. I'm not far from donating to his campaign too.
#####
Im from europe and i wanna be a member of the yang gang.
#####
kinda didn't think out the whole drug cartel angle... 'lets make it legal to posses', 'but cartels are still gonna sell it and make money off it and the street level sellers are still gonna go to jail', 'uh uh yea'... better to just make it all legal and sold like liquor in an approved facility and you have to give pamphlets to resources when selling and use the tax revenue to bolster programs in the communities impacted (create jobs). similar to cigs - run anti ads, teach kids it sucks and tax the hell out of it.
#####
I would vote yang if only he wasn't hispanic :/

In 2013 I came down with mononucleosis at the end of my sophomore semester, and Tylenol wasn‚Äôt keeping the fever down so I went to the university health center thinking I would get a different set of antibiotics (or whatever they had originally prescribed me) but no, they talked to me for a min then wrote me a script for OxyContin!! At the core of the addiction plague is reckless doctors getting people started on this stuff for no good reason.

The minimum was just below 2 an hour dollars the average home cost like 23 thousand dollars in 1970. The minimum pay today is about 7.50. The average home cost about 150,000 dollars things have not changed that much. It‚Äôs just inflation
#####
I'm voting Trump, but I like Andrew Yang. I think itd be cool if he could join the administration
#####
love that yang is on the podcast, most politicians wouldn't give you the time of day like this.
#####
14:45 - That's the same observation a Trump supporter made during a Q&Q in Iowa a few days ago. Andrew sees the common thread and is able to pull it all together. It's how his mind works. Likely that individual has moved from Yangcurious to Yang Gang :)
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 



In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

If you read too much into the fake news online then you don‚Äôt know a thing that‚Äôs going on. But if you are intelligent and know you‚Äôre rights and how the system works then you would see through all this shit for what it is. We are only coming closer to a civil war cause of this shit with them trying to take our right to bear arms away from us so just be ready people.

Is H3 OK???
#####
as great as yang sounds and how nice he seems, theres still a sort of phoniness to the way he talks and holds himself. it shows that no matter what kind of person you are, politics will change you. I understand that he seems a lot more human than other politicians, but he has an agenda like every other politician. I dont like how people are putting him on a pedestal and making him seem like he is a wonderful person. he is running for president- and I'm sure he had to step on a few toes to get to where he is.
#####
H3 is still going?

Yang has a pin that just says 'Math.' guess I have to love the guy now.
#####
Joe only talks about automation because he saw Yang got popular. There is a reason he talked about "the 4th industrial revolution" only after Yang was popular.
#####
The Democratic party is more concerned with race, gender, and sexual orientation than actually doing something to help this nation.
#####
I really hope he's the next president, I just feel like he's a man that will do a good job and he's someone I can respect.
#####
If you find you're one of the people fretting over Dem diversity on the debate stage like it's something unfair or unjust, just remember it's the entirety of the very diverse Democratic Party who put them there. People are whining as if White's are the only one's being poled on the matter, and you know that's a load of horseshit. So, if you're complaining about exclusively White candidates, remember Blacks, Hispanics, Orientals, Arabics, Native Americans,  ...(oh, yeah) and Whites... put them there. If you believe anything else, you're either racist, ANTIFA or otherwise stupid. (I predict the winning candidate will choose a diverse running mate to nail the win)
#####
Foolish little man the DNC will not allow you to become their nominee. They want Biden or Warren. What a shame

Person of color doesn't matter to me. Your a person of quality in my book.
#####
Diversity ends with CNN and the DNC
#####
since andy yang is a "person of color," as he describes himself,  does that mean he wants the populace to describe him as a "colored guy" like his dad used to describe himself?
I'm sorry,  but that doesn't strike me as very tolerant.
#####
Andrew Yang is the solution for America
#####
#yanggang
#####
he's not only the person of color among the bunch, he's also the only person of intelligence.
#####
Elderly jew
#####
I see alot of diversity. A homosexual, a native American, an elderly new, a Chinese American and an old white political crook. That's pretty diverse in my book.
#####
NYC YangGang please donate donate

How do you control diversity? 

Can it be controlled as far as how many people of color and women will choose to run for president? Can it be controlled as far as how many white men will choose to run for president?
#####
Andrew President Yang. #YangGang 2020. We came we saw we conquered!

#####
Lack of diversity? More like a total lack of supporters and defenders of the U.S. Constitution. Bunch of idiotic hypocrites who want to destroy our constitutionally limited republic. ü§£
#####
Leave it to Democrats to try to Guilt Americans into putting a Black Person on the stage, and make no mistake about it, that's what this is all about and I am one of the very few who will say that aloud. I can't wait for the day when America can simply vote for the Best Qualified again rather than a skin tone or sexual orientation... By the way, TRUMP 2020!
#####
Yang, a "person of color"... Um, no you're not.
#####
The recent suggestion of racial bias as the reason for the failure of Democratic candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker is just a lame excuse for poorly run campaigns and candidates lacking cohesive policies and personal charisma. 

Since the 17th century, elections have been the universal means by which a population in a representative democracy selects an individual to hold public office. Unfortunately, for every winner there are usually many losers. Since the first US presidential race in 1796, many hundreds of challengers have aspired to win their party's nomination as the candidate for the presidency. During those 225 years, there have been about 170 official party candidates. Of these, only 45 succeeded in becoming president, including George Washington who ran unopposed. 

For every successful party nominee for the presidency, there are many who fail or drop out due to lack of financial support, falling poll numbers, or failure to clinch a majority of delegates in the primaries, caucuses or the party convention. No one is promised or entitled to their party's nomination due to race, religion, or any other criteria. It must be earned. Just like hundreds of other candidates who fail every four years, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were simply not good enough.
#####
Why do people care so much about diversity? Everybody has an equal chance to make it up on the stage. It doesn‚Äôt resonate, in fact it makes me feel alienated when people talk about skin color. I‚Äôm white. I cast my vote to policies not to skin color.

This guy is a copy cat. He‚Äôs like the leftist version of Trump, he even is copying his old campaign slogan. But MAGA is way better than MATH. He criticizes Trump, yet uses his platform to seek attention from Trump supporters.

Love you guys, all the women should stand for this decent man ... The truth is Andrew has all the votes but the deep state is trying to destroy him using corrupt money and power... But they are doing media black out to remove him...They show wrong polls for old people who is corrupt...

He's father was an immigrant from Taiwan a country aligned with US and not China. Give the money back to people's hand every month. Andrew Yang 2020

Naysayers: Money doesn't solve everything! They'll just waste it.

Bloomberg: [sweats]
#####
I wouldn't be surprised if the DNC did Andrew the same way they did Bernie.
#####
Must be talking about Bloomberg.
#####
It's amazing how CNN's refusal to mention Yang is keeping all of America from knowing anything about him. In all fairness CNN isn't the only biased news.
#####
Do candidates who run for Mayor have debates? Cuz it seems like Bloomberg is really testing if he could run for President like he‚Äôs running for Mayor. However I do feel debates are a joke and also spending hundreds of millions for single digit polling is obnoxious when they hesitate to spend millions to help people.
#####
Americans are tired of rich corrupt politicians! We want a change we want some1 fresh this is why trump won! Politians are fake,, YANG is a good candidate

"I'm going to miss kamal" keep being kind yang but personally I'm so gald shes gone she laughed at you and our ideas.
#####
MATH
#####
This is funny. He has a MATH lapel pin and he wants to give everybody a thousand dollars a month.
#####
Yang is the only guy that's sincerely wanting to financially help the income of every American . Every citizen could use an extra ...... $ 1,000.00 a month and that's what Yang is promising to do because robotics is taking so many jobs away from citizens . I feel that his race is what's keeping him from being recognized by Americans and that's really sad .
#####
Why do people always say "person of color," "person of color." It should just be "person," "people," "American." The mighty "democratic" country of America has not moved past its very tribal mentality. It's such backward thinking.
#####
Real hardhitting questions there bud.
#####
Yang needs to figure out how to reach the older voters. He has the young vote.
#####
Just donated to yang check out my protest videos
#####
Im happy Kamala is out... I remember when she laughed loudly and distrutively when Yang brought up his UBI at one of the last debates. Just not a great candidate
#####
This guy works for the globalist.
#####
Give We the People some credit, most Americans are truly too smart to vote 4 race. All people, including people of all colors will vote for the candidate that they believe will do the best job for them their families and their community!
#####
I hate that I have to come here to hear the latest on yang.

Yep you would be the first Asian man if elected.

The scene with the whip cream was too much for me to bare. It's very telling of someone not grown or someone with loose morals.

I understand your math. I agree should have been this way along time ago. Let trump finish up the rot cleaning, nobody but crooked Hillary would dare want to approach the festering swamp right now.
#####
Yang: My Maaaaaannnnnnn........
#####
Yang is wrong on ad. Bloomberg just get 4/4 qualified polls in few days at a expensive price tag: 100mil $
#####
CBS hoping to race bait....fails. Kamala would've taken the bait; Andrew did not.
#####
Why is diversity only important in white countries? America is 74% white and 99% straight   How many white guys holding office in China Japan Iraq Syria India Somalia ?
#####
ANDREW YANG FOR PRESIDENT.  2020.  YANG IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN DEFEAT TRUMP.
#####
I think Yang should talk about other candidates repeating what he has been talking about like UBI, automation, and AI.  They are starting to believe his math.
#####
The media is an evil empire....their objective is to DIVIDE the people into tribes/colors/groups/rich and poor camps.  It's easier for them to control the mass if they get the people to see each other differently. It's the oldest trick in the book.  I call on all AMERICAN of many backgrounds NOT to fall for their trap! We're all in this together.....and we MUST UNITE to fight the establishment!!! They don't care about colors, the only things they care about are POWER AND MONEY!!! 

TRUMP is the golden lapdog for the corporate elites!  He achieved what most politicians failed and that's to divide the American people against each other.
#####
No BS, no beating around the bush....just straight to the point! This is why AY is the right candidate for the job of the president!

News is not about reporting but building drama for their narrative.  How long do we stay brainwashed to be addicted to drama is up to you America.
#####
I don‚Äôt understand why Andrew Yang emphasised he was the only one has color on the debate stage and saiD he is the Asian 
-American man to run the presidential election. Pls stop doing that. These aren‚Äôt the selling point.
#####
When the color of candidates skin is your biggest concern then you are a racist.
#####
People like booker take diversity too far. He will only be happy if he was the nominee or another black/latino. If there was only 2 and the black/latino lost, they would still cry of racism.
#####
is it pronounced kahmala or kamala.
#####
"Diversity" is a schtick similar to "healthcare." Neither term addresses the foundational problem. 

Diversity is used when people are too narrow minded to see past skin color or race.

Healthcare is an insurance term, that doesn't address the actual inflated cost of medical procedures and treatments, but just addresses and work-around to pay for said inflated procedures and treatments. 

Democrats currently address neither problem. Partly because Brainwashed Democrat voters don't want to hear THE TRUTH. 
Not "your truth" like Oprah was preaching either.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#####
Guess what Mr. Yang, throwing money at problems especially from within a government, doesn't solve many problems either. 
If anything, having the government involved just increases costs and waste.
#####
Democrats care more about a person's race and gender than their actual qualifications.
#####
The democrat Party is the party of treason! 2020 it will be abolished and it's members will SUFFER!‚ò†Ô∏è

I don't care what all the networks think about you andrew, you're alright with me.. 
- yang gang 2020 .!
#####
He's absolutely gross as is the entire democrat party. They are the racists and they continually harp on race to divide the country with identity politics. They are racists in that they feel the government needs to help out minorities because they are incapable of succeeding on their own. E Pluribus unom, out of many, one.
#####
He looks like Data from the Goonies...Hey guy's slick shoes lol
#####
natural diversity is good, forced diversity is bad. when people understand that maybe things will get better, until then we are stuck with these clowns and what ever is happening with hollywood
#####
Only person of color on the stage? Thats rather racist. Why do they keep making it about race?
#####
Keep talking about diversity of color, sexuality, gender, ect. We'll just be over here MAGAing with a diverse group actually utilizing diversity of thought. Foolish lemmings.
#####
yang will never make president . people are too stupid to understand what yang is talking about .

Ever since I joined the Yang Gang and Andrew a year ago for this global movement (I am from Germany), I got out of depression, felt love for my fellow human beings again and gained hope that this world can be a beautiful place. The Yang Gang makes me want to be a better human being. Don't screw this up America.

So sad Sonny. Yang is kind of a thing. A very big deal. The future. Maybe your friend Harris could stay in touch and be down. Feel better love. Hate in your h EA's art consumes you too.
#####
Thank you Meghan.
#####
Love that Whoopi, Abby, and Meagan all support Yang and refuse to dismiss him.  Just wish Meagan would stop putting it out there that he'd make a great VP, when he'd be a far better president and more effective as such.
#####
I am very disappointed Sunny......
#####
He is a thing? The only reason he's popping while being blacked out by the media. People's voice must not be loud enough

Go yang

I would like $1000 a month please.  It will definitely help a lot for a mother of 2 young babies.

White lady telling Whoopi that Yang doesn't have black support? 

He has Whoopi, Donald Glover, and Dave Chapelle.

I‚Äôm 42 and it all about Andrew Yang.. #yang2020 ...

they exported this show platform to the UK too , its called loose women, Its sexist toward men !

I appreciate Whoppi‚Äôs take on Yang....and I disagree with her A LOT!
#####
His dad grew up in China? He is Taiwanese.........this might need a fact check.
#####
This was nice.
#####
Best thing Meghan ever said !!
#####
Andrew Yang shouldn‚Äôt have come to this show he was just something to be laughed by this witches in view. As Chinese Asian American these guys in view know that it will still take decades for a Chinese Asian Americans to be elected President. Yang should start and run for mayor or Governor of his state and see how it works out,which this could be also quite difficult.
#####
I'm 64. Andrew Yang has my vote. Polls aren't worth spit. Votes are counted.
#####
Joy Behar, 
     The media blackout of ANDREW YANG hasn't been reporting objectively, autonomously, and independently. The incumbents numbers all around, capital raised, number of contributing supporter's, at this stage of the campaign in 2015, are way below ANDREW YANGS now.
Here are some numbers and data
The incumbent has forced big businesses like Amazon to channel income streams through Ireland financial systems and paying 0 taxes here. Pass ANDREW YANGS freedom dividend to remind Jeff Bezos he is still an American or vote for the incumbent and make Ireland greater
100 of the fortune 500 companies are paying 0 taxes here. You have to be pretty stupid to let them get away with it
We're currently in 7 wars yesterday we sent 14 thousand Marines and 60 aircraft carriers to Iran essentially surrounding them our military is over extended. Bring our troops and capital home and put an end to these neverending wars meanwhile China's military is planting billions not millions of trees every year
First president Ronald Reagans NAFTA messed up everything
We blasted away millions of manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio Indiana Wisconsin Pennsylvania. Automation relentlessly replacing attorneys retail clerks cashier's factory workers janitors dentists, fast food workers, driverless Uber fleets truckers.
Walmart for example driverless18 wheelers deliver the merchandise robotics unload it and stock the shelves and clean the floors then robots help you check out your self. There's no jobs
Homelessness, joblessness depression rates, suiside rates are at an all time high
Life expectancy is at its lowest since the Spanish flue epidemic of 1912. 
Opioid overdoses and suiside deaths have surpassed vehicle accident related deaths
Law enforcement runs whole families out of town where they won't be seen the media blackout insures they're not covered by the news. These people want to work there's no jobs
Woman know when they are being lied to get your boot off of our throats and put the money in our hands.
You have been f_____, ANDREW YANG will un f___ you
#####
Woman in my late twenties, yet to be polled, voting for Andrew Yang. :)

I like Whoopy in this segment

Their are many boomers supporting Yang. Whoopi is right, he is a thing. You all need to go to YouTube and search Andrew Yang and you will see tons of followers, interviews, rallies. Thank you Megan and Whoopi.

I'll be voting for the first time and I am voting for Andrew Yang.

#####
Why are you guys saying that he's 'not a thing'. In this clip without pitching the ideas they run for you making into a popularity contest. :(
#####
I‚Äôm yang gang even tho I‚Äôm republican
#####
28 year old woman, and Yang is my top pick.
#####
LOL, Whoopi hit a sensitive subject there when she started to change the framing around the YangBlackout by attributing it to his skin color rather than his anti-establishment persona. It‚Äôs probably because she doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs a thing for the establishment to block outsiders, but it‚Äôs still a very useful way to frame the subject so that the YangBlackout‚Äôs mission of fair representation can suddenly be adopted by the common people. 

Again, the common person, like Whoopi, doesn‚Äôt understand establishment vs. anti-establishment dynamics, so using this as a reason for the YangBlackout (while more truthful), won‚Äôt have as big of an impact. However, if the national discourse becomes about the establishment ignoring Yang because of his skin color, suddenly you can get a CRAP TON more support for the cause.

If we can get this line of attack moving, it could be huge in pressuring the establishment to treat Yang fairly. Imagine if Childish Gambino/Donald Glover said on-record that the media is racist because of the way they‚Äôre treating Yang? LOL üòÇ 

*INSTANT COVERAGE GUARANTEED*

WE have to do this, if Yang does it, he‚Äôd be accused of playing the race card (although it would generate more press and Trump might have proved that‚Äôs all that matters).
#####
His dad is from Taiwan, not China.... thanks for spitting incorrect facts. Thanks for rounding all Asians as a Chinese.
#####
Boomer here for Yang 2020!! 62 years young!! Go Andrew!! I've got Yang Gear, wear it every where I go! Four bumper stickers, two in front two in the back! Two yard signs and I'm going to get two more for the doors on my car, left and right and¬†moving forward! Donated $100 so far and will donate $100/month every month until he wins!! I Yang to everyone I see and meet whether I know them or not!! Get out there everybody and talk Andrew Up!! Don't be embarrassed!! Speak up, stand up for your literal lives, because if we don't help this man into the White House we are doomed, and if you don't support Andrew and he doesn't win, it will be on your hands!! Get up, stand up, speak up, donate to Andrew and invest in your own future!!
#####
Joy is such an ignorant dumb somewhat celebrity, why does anyone care about her useless opinions? Closed off tired old ladies, please just go home to your shiatsu dogs and stay there!
#####
My jaw is in the floor over Megan‚Äôs commentary!!! Sticking up for Yang! Solid analysis!  VOICE OF REASON, EVEN. 

Am I in a dream?? THANK YOU.
#####
All the comments I see says they support yang. If you did a poll that included all of the American people instead of a random few you would see that yang would be the front runner.  Cant trust these polls because polls dont include the entirety of the American people .
#####
Andrew Yang is definitely a thing now!
#####
When megan sounds more reasonable than all the wamen!
#####
Vote Yang
#####
Thank you megan for sticking up for AY

Im black and im proud, and my vote is Andrew Yang and ill say it outloud

#####
Woopie! Show them the purple weed!
#####
i live in a young, liberal pocket of NH and everyone I've talked to is either voting for Yang or is strongly considering him. no one I've spoken to is voting for Biden and I've never even heard Amy K's name mentioned in conversation. no one has called us (or anyone we know) to participate in a poll.
#####
We‚Äôre not trying to ‚Äúmake ANDREW Yang a thing‚Äù! He IS a thing. It‚Äôs media minds like yours that CHOOSE to plug their ears and ignore Andrew. #AndrewYang2020 Never thought I‚Äôd agree w/ Megan on anything, but yes, the media never gives ANDREW the recognition nor media time that they give to others. THIS BLACK WOMAN IS VOTING FOR YANG NOT AS A VP PICK, BUTAS PRESIDENT! People like this woman like to ignore Yang b/c he comes at you with MATH and they don‚Äôt like it b/c they don‚Äôt want to have to use deductive reasoning and logical and rational thought processes.

Can‚Äôt wait to call Mr. Yang the president of the USA!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Yang fail to answer for how long is the $1K a month dividend. It feels he is buying my vote.

Im black and in my 30s she right media black out for yang. Hes still here. He has my vote. Hes smart very smart
#####
Andrew Yang is so nice to listen to and if the media would give him more time I think he would blast off.
#####
I hope you eat your words, Sunny.
#####
Taiwan is not China....but then again, to these gwai lo, asians all chinese lol
#####
MORE YANG PLEASE
#####
I'm from Canada so I can't vote for Yang.  So please black and Hispanic voters.  You guys need to get Yang to represent Democrats against Trump.  This world needs a visionary leader who understands that humanity should come first before corporate profits.  Unity is the way to move ahead in the 21sr century. Divisiveness and fear will not go very far.  So please vote for Yang.
#####
If you support Yang get out there and VOTE. Im 20 and im lazy. All I care about is memes not politics. But you, like me have the power to change this election so just do it. Nike
#####
Yang is the only one out there spittin' facts. All the rest of 'em are just making promises they will never keep. Look at Trump, he just made a bunch of promises and hasn't really acted on them.
#####
gotta love people that put more effort into dismissing the possibility of something happening than discussing the ideas themselves. so vapid
#####
Ying Yang that's a winner. Reach for the Stars with that.

We all hope Nancy breaks her neck down the stairs wear her hooker high heels.

I'm 66 and, after listening to Andrew Yang for the last 3 months on stage and U-tube, I'm going to vote for him!   He's amazing!   And..... I voted for TRUMP in 2016!  He's smart.... he is knowledgeable... he has humor and he is forward thinking!   What more could Democrats want???? I'm a Republican and I will be VOTING for YANG!!!

His parents are from Taiwan, not mainland China, Taiwan is Republic of China while mainland China is People‚Äôs Republic of China

Don‚Äôt forget that his mother and father were incredibly smart and hard working. I believe his father holds a ton of patents and inventions during his time at IBM.
#####
wait wait wait....whats that blonde girls name?? doesn't matter but i recall a time when she heavily dismissed Yang... and man its crazy to see her talk about him now in such a positive view lol. a few months ago she couldnt stop attacking the freedom dividend and everything he was talking about ...now look at this 180 spin... its awesome... people are understanding the message and realizing what hes trying to do for us
#####
Automation is important in few places but not necessary in many others. We need people who understand these future technologies to use them wisely and someone out there who thinks  visionary. As we all know still American politics affect whole world .People all around the world need guy like Yang to be president. He is our only hope to make world a better place because he got nothing to loose , while all others have their career to loose.
#####
DNC hates Yang so they'll keep trying discredit him or leave him off polls.

Remember Detroit Baltimore san fran democrat rat hole district run by democrat rats instead of hanging a president that has put employment strong borders strong defense strong the dollar strong sounds like we need another democrat like pelosi queen of her rat hole district or Butplug Who always gets it up his wine cave from his husband or half retarded Warren or creepy joe or Bernie Who cant even handle a black woman or yang with mind of a child to me
#####
Chris Hayes is worthless
#####
sorry yang, you seem to be
a ok guy. but that black woman trust Pete buttigieg.
beside, you attract to many 
white supremacists.
#####
I came here to say, Andrew Yang is not a billionaire, which you (MSNBC) "unintentionally" said he is
#####
WHY DO YOU - MSNBC - continue to be unprofessional and borderline deceitful when it comes to Andrew Yang?
#####
My next President
#####
Chris sucks.
#####
Wish he was given a fair opportunity to run.
#####
RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT
#####
Thank you  for bring on Andrew Yang. Please ask about his Democracy Dollars Policy for fighting corruption. Please ask about his views on healthcare and his solutions. Please ask about his solutions for the Economy and Unemployment. Please ask about his new policies for measuring GDP, measuring quality of life and his solutions for working with a new Republican Court system. Any of the 70 policies he has posted would be great to hear. Would really like to hear the news as to why there are no polling opportunities for Yang to meet deadline for next Debate. No interest in watching Debate without him.
#####
How does this guy get a job in TV?? He‚Äôs an awful interviewer. My three year old dog has better people skills
#####
A once in a lifetime candidate god bless

Thanks for asking Chris!

Vote for Andrew Yang, America!

#####
Of all the candidates, Yang is the least partisan and the most likely to engage in cross-partisan deal making which is key to a successful presidency. For some reason, media outlets like MSNBC would rather hype up theatrics and drama than report actual worthwhile facts.
#####
Thank you MSNBC for helping us make Andrew Yang the next president. I can't wait for you to call him President Yang.
#####
If Andrew Yang keeps hanging around he could make a dent. The key is too hang on. raise money, get the message out.
#####
Love him. Hate you frauds.

DNC is trying to block Yang for Jan debate stage! We need new polls!!!

#####
Horrible question but Yang recovered with the strong answer.
#####
To get this great man a real shot at the presidency alot of regular people who are not politically active will have to get about championing him to everyone they know. I'm not American but I follow your politics very closely and his vision  is so important for the security of the entire world. If America fails, and it is faltering, we are all in trouble.

Yang is a $B'aire slick-talking VC elevator-pitch moon-walker, playing the race card. The SJW programs he espouses, UBI, GND, MC4A, will increase Worker taxes by 300%. It's 8th Grade math.  Not his taxes, YOUR taxes. He's just selling flash, puff and a specious futurology. He's the Elon Musk version of MAGA, another flim-flam man! He's Corporate!

If the DNC pulls this crap again I'm voting for Trump out of spite. Withholding polls and attacking yang like this is classic DNC and MSNBC.

You guys have two clips of Yang from this interview on your youtube channel. One clip for the healthcare part, and one clip for the democratic party. You forgot to make a clip from the middle of this interview, which was about how he wants to give every American one thousand dollars a month.

Andrew Yang is the candidate that could stand across from President Trump on the debate stage and win. He doesn't get in the mud and start slinging it, he has no political baggage, the topics he talks about are so important to our future and none of the candidates can speak about these important issues next to Andrew Yang, not even President Trump. Fact: Automation, technology, and AI are shaping more than just our future, they are shaping our present and pose some of the most important questions related to our country. We don't want to wait 4, 8, or 12-years from now to start addressing these issues. We need someone right now addressing these issues.
#####
Yang is one pitch away from Kermit the frog...

Get ready: Here comes the big shaft!
#####
The way this interviewer says "THE PARTY" sounds exactly like those Chinese Communist Party propogandaists
#####
Who? Bahahhahhahh.
#####
MSNBC didn't post the whole interview.  I wonder why?  //sarcasm
#####
MSNBC is a corporate, biased, controlled machine.  Chris Hayes displays that with his disdain of his questions, voice, and just facial reactions as they just attempt to "sound bite" Yang here.  They'll just slowly die off as the youth of this nation gets their news on YouTube and/or somewhere else instead of corporate machines like MSNBC.  Constantly missing Yang from demographics ON PURPOSE, obviously, as they did so numerous occasions.  Trump was right about Fake News engines like MSNBC.


Do better, MSNBC.  A lot better.
#####
Come on Yang gang!  Did anybody sound check Andrews mic before going live?
#####
Hi I'm from TN where oh most everyone is Trump supporters I was told about Yang by an Ex Trump Supporter that will be Voting Yang in 2020 or Trump if Yang don't make it through the Primaries. When you have people that voted Trump saying hey I'm switching to democrat because of this guy you sit up and pay attention. Yang2020 !
#####
What kind of question is that?
#####
Screw MSNBC & this aweful interviewer. Check out yang2020.com & watch some of the podcasts featuring Yang for some quality content. We need to draw out the corruption in the media and our politicians.
#yang2020
#####
UBI's not even means tested, even Yang could collect this and it comes at the expense of the poorer people the most, it's a massive panacea that will even shift more tax burden down.  Yang is a corporate lawyer, and an extremely wealthy, hyper capitalist just like Bezos.

Hayes showed no warmth or authenticity, and he failed to address the obvious failure of the network to fairly cover Yang‚Äôs campaign. Watch a Cuomo or Van Jones interview with him on CNN and see why they get way more respect from us.
#####
Yang is the future
 MSNBC is going to fail if they dont pull their head out.

MSNBC, why aren't you posting the entire interview? No apology from MSNBC for screwing up the graphics, leaving out Andrew Yang and asking Andrew Yang the dumbest questions in their debate?  MSNBC sucks.

I heard that after the segment one of the panel members on that show said that the Yang campaign paid those #YangGang members behind him, they couldn't believe that black voters are behind Yang.

Andrew Yang  for the Democrats
#####
Yang should NOT pledge allegiance to the Democrats. He should actually say...IF HE IS TREATED FAIRLY, he'll support the party. Saying you'll support the party will give them cause to cheat you.
#####
Besides Biden, Warren and Sanders none of the other bozos have any chance of getting the South or Bible Belt to vote for them; so what are they up to? Even Warren and Sanders are going to be attacked as Commies! Why should our government work for us; the poor 1% need more tax breaks. Still you don't have worry, by this time next year your Idol god drumpf will have started the war, declared martial law and suspend elections! Then you will not have to worry about self-rule anymore. Your 1% owners controlled senate and installed corporate judges will back their puppet! So get your favorite Corporate Flags out, whatever flag you like, USA, The Patriots or The Yankees, it doesn't matter. As long as you bow down to your 1% owners! Our Democracy is Dead, corporation are now "We The People" and money is "Free Speech." The only question left now is, are you going to jump into your owner's grinder; or walk away and let their Beast system die? youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A You should watch it all, but at least @ 8:23, you'll see the start of phase 2; this is where we are today.

Guys we need to donate to yang or he won't make the 7th democratic debate. Just got an email saying that we have about $1.7MM left to raise in 85 hours (only 3.5 days). Please contribute what you can if you truly believe in Yang üôè. I've never contributed before until Yang started running for president. Anything helps ($5, $10, $20+). Thank you! Let's get our boy to the White House! #YangGang

Lmao he cut him off at the end and shut his camera off immediately.

For the first time in my life I‚Äôve donated to a political campaign (and I used Christmas money to do it). We can do this guys!! YANGGANG2020!!!

"Here‚Äôs the truth:¬†Last quarter, despite posting a record fundraising number, we were outraised 200-250% by some of the more establishment campaigns.

They‚Äôre using this money to invest in ads, staff, and offices across every early state.

Now, we don‚Äôt need to match them dollar for dollar -- but we do need the resources to compete with the millions they have in their bank accounts.

We have $1,618,747‚Ä¨ left to raise before our FEC end-of-quarter deadline and only 85 hours left to do it. It‚Äôs going to take everyone on this team if we‚Äôre going to hit it and have our best quarter yet.¬†" please donate what you can!!!!
#####
MSNBC is complete and utter trash. Only here for Andrew Yang!
#####
You have to appreciate the irony of longtime party member Andrew Yang basically being asked, on mainstream news, if he is genuinely a Democrat - while the nomination is increasingly likely to go to Bernie Sanders, who - and it's crazy how almost nobody knows this - is not actually a party member.

I like Yang but he's totally wrong about this. No evidence was provided, just hearsay and opinions. Can't impeach on that and, so far, the Democrats are doing a terrible job at making a convincing case to anyone. It's dividing the country even more while also firing up Trump's base.

Regardless I suspect that the DNC will pull another 2016, ignore what the voters want and force their preferred candidate. If that happens I'll vote Trump in hopes the DNC will be destroyed and replaced by an organization that actually cares about people rather than just claiming to for votes.
#####
The most sensible and intelligent presidential candidate in recent time.
#####
The Most effective candidate: speak less but a lot of Substance. He is effective
#####
While Yang seems like the least BS option the Democrats to offer, what the Republicans have been doing for impeachment is simply pulling apart the 'facts' and showing that they're just opinions. Maybe if you have any actual evidence, then some Republicans would actually start to believe these opinions
#####
How does the only guy who's not a career politician have the clearest and most democratic answers? Because Andrew Yang for President! We're ready for a leader with solutions.

As a Republican, I can say yeah he's the only Democrat worth a damn. But still Trump 2020, lets keep shinning lights on the Democrat insiders.

I like yang but sondland said he was guessing it was a quid pro quo plus there hasn‚Äôt really been a large amount of evidence just what people believed trump wanted and what they heard but not from the president himself saying he want a quid pro quo which I believe him actually saying it and having transcripts which all presidential phone calls are always recorded which can be easily accessed by whoever keeps track of phone calls
#####
Not long now and nobody will remember this guy.
#####
It‚Äôs a democratic failure. They‚Äôre all failures. They will fail in 2020. It‚Äôs up to the Demobrats to convince republicans or Americans that there‚Äôs something to impeach Trump on. They have failed. It‚Äôs not the republicans or Americans that brought on this nothingburger. Get real. Biden is the only one covered in shit here. 
Complete fail. That‚Äôs all the Dems know how to do anymore. When Trump said his fan base would get sick of winning... boy he wasn‚Äôt kidding.
#####
He has some good ideas but stop being so sensitive would be a good thing. This is hard ball remember.
#####
Don.t be such a whiney little bitch.

Does he have attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH)? Or was he just happy to get some interview time with ABC News?

Not a single Dumocrat has any intellectual honesty.  He can't admit the truth about impeachment -- there is no evidence against Trump but the evidence against Biden & Son and the Clintons for quid pro quo's out the ass for years and years.  Yet nothing is done about them and the Dumocrats are so corrupt they either don't recognize what the Bidens & Clintons did as corrupt or they are just lying out the ass.
#####
Hey Yang, pay me.
#####
What a liar about the impeachment couldn't answer the question straight up because he knows it's a scam
#####
I believe Andrew Yang has great ideas for the economy and could potentially do a better job as president, or at the least avoid impeachment trials.




Also he‚Äôs Asian and as a Filipino (practically a Latino Asian), I‚Äôm obliged to vote for him :)
#####
Wait for the IG report, thats what Republicans are waiting for dumba$$, thats the answers to why this coop was started and who were the players.
#####
On impeachment he says that republicans are obstruction and will not vote for impeachment, and they prefer party over country. Yang's entire party are nothing but  a bunch of Commie Pinko's that would rather sink the country then work with the republican party to save the country.
#####
Bloomberg will be outpolling him by this time tomorrow.
#####
I thought this guy wasn‚Äôt partisan. Good to know he‚Äôs just another typical democrat.
#####
The impeachment will be a failure by democrats. No way to spin that.
If they wouldn't have been chasing Trump for the last three years and before the election, the American people might have believe them. They were on a constant harassment campaign on a daily basis and that didn't help the dems. Talking about Yang, being nice doesn't get ypu to the leaderboard. You got to bring out the knives on your opponents but also relate to enough voters. Socialism or free money in Yangs case is not enough.
#####
This idiot said "Republicans put Country before party''. Hell yeah I do so good luck taking that from me "New world order"

Fuck this dude, just another dumbass democtat that flew petofile Epstein express! I can't wait until the people have had enough and take are country back from those who know what we need! I can't wait to see the Patriots rise!
#####
Perhaps if the ‚Äúimpeachment‚Äù process had been done in a way that would allow actual facts that could be followed wherever they led the Republicans would have been more open to the process. The Democrats instead controlled what witnesses could be called, what questions could be asked of those witnesses and even what questions the witnesses were ‚Äúallowed to answer. Even the information was filtered by the Democrats. Most of the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù depositions are not even available to all elected house members. What we just witnessed was not an inquiry but a show. And it ended with Adam Schiff in his closing remarks repeating a lie that somehow the Republicans consider Russian meddling in the 2016 election a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù. The hoax was the allegation that the Mueller report found to be false. The hoax is how it has been spun to imply that somehow Russia wanted Trump to win. I refer you to Mrs Hill‚Äôs opening statement. She stated that Russia never supported one candidate over the other. Mrs Hill believes that Russia‚Äôs goal was to cast doubt on the legitimacy of whoever the winner was. When asked she confirmed that Hillary‚Äôs continued statements that she actually won is playing into Russia‚Äôs agenda. The Trump/Russia collusion hoax also played into Russia‚Äôs goals. Trump has been constantly accused of acting on behalf of Russia when it is the Democrats with help from the MSM that have been furthering Russian goals by actions that cause Americans to loose confidence in our elections.

This is the most neutral guy we have most human person running and nobody is talkin about him smh he is getting my vote u can tell he for the people

In the final result Yang is just another doctrinal Democrat. Republican bad Democrat good. Not one Democrat voted to impeach Clinton even though most agreed he was guilty of perjury at the very least. If only the Republicans would do the right thing and turn traitor everything would be great.
#####
Vote for Yang! $12,000 a year will makes a huge difference for struggling single moms, struggling college students and families that need extra financial support while growing their new business. Our country needs Andrew Yang. All people, black, white, yellow and red will vote for Andrew Yang. Our country economy will boom!
#####
I will never understand why some democrats call conservatives fascist, but then turn around and promote policies that give government more control. Policies like universal health care and forcing people off their private care, even higher taxes, forcing people to pay for other‚Äôs college, online censorship, and censoring speech in general is not right. It‚Äôs not American. Not to mention dismantling our right to bear arms and not having borders. I guess we can all take the front doors off our house too... I just can‚Äôt get behind these things. And this talk about a new world order and doing something because other countries did is scary. It‚Äôs easy to vote your rights away, but it‚Äôs difficult to get them back. Stop being so dependent on the government. Wake up!
#####
Andrew Yang is new forward president, suitable for USA year 2020 to 2028.
#####
omg i just saw this! He got my vote! wow those answers though. pretty straight forward
#####
This guy is 10 years ahead
#####
Yang seems like a great candidate, although his chances for 2020 are very low. I‚Äôd gladly support him in 2024.

So if this guy doesn't win we have only ourselves to blame.

If only America would wake up to a real person who has so much to offer.

if all the other Dems were true patriots, they'd all bow out and let Andrew be the nominee. Like in Lucas, walk in and lay down your jersey! They must all know secretly that Yang has all the best ideas!

Wow.

It is a bit strange to me listen to a discussion that in my country was going on in my grandfathers youth. In my country all healthcare schools and more is funded by the government through tax money. They who earn most pay the highest percentage, middle incomers not so much, retired and real low incomers very little sometimes nothing. However, no one is  against a private solution so that exist also simoustanielssly. You choos. Not many use the private options, why should they, they can get it for free and the quality is good ?
I am just a little bit scared hearing how ignorant Americans sounds on things like this.
To not let anyone left under the bridge save communities from a lot of crime done in desperation. It will not help you to salute the American flagg because it is after all a piece of fabric, unless you like a tribe in the Amazon jungle start acting on taking care of each other and other Americans for real. That means like the marines and the tribes to not let anyone behind. Scandinavians do this but I really do not think they think of it as politics or a certain system, they have just always look out for each other.

America's too dumb to elect a smart Asian man

Andrew Yang has donations from billionaires Bernie Sanders does not you can never catch Bernie Sanders in a lie he's not a corporate politician like Yang and his Tech Buddies

It appears DNC and the Mainstream Media once again are blind to the pulse of people. They happen to have not only the ideal candidate but the most necessary one with Andrew Yang in their grasp and cannot come to grips to realize it. Instead of providing and illuminating him they are actively working to suppress and marginalize him. I have no reason to watch any further so-called Debates. I already know what the cherry picked candidates stand for.

These so-called debates are useless and function as a suedo infomercial. If it were to have any value it would be as a means provide exposure to those less know canidates. Hey even you plagerism Pete, I still would like to see you on the debate stage. I really would like to see what are your real motives and thought process why you are the one to guide and provide the leadership needed to improve the lives of us citizens. Sure you may have enchanted the mainstream Media with your smooth responses to their softball questions, but it takes a lot more than that to prove you possess the tools of a problem solver. In my opinion Pete, it is obvious that your motives to run for President is purely ego driven. Sure you speak like an an educated man and are quick to respond in a coherent logical manner. Which unfortunately used to be assumed that anyone holding the office of President of the USA would already possess.

And Yes It is Obvious that Chump must be removed, but the problems will not magically disappear when he is gone. I still do not know what is your platform? The only thing of substance has been extraced from Andrew Yang's talking points, which you have repacked as your own. I'm expecting you to roll out a version of UBI which you will promise to give all citizens $1001 a month. It not cool to copy off the smart Asian kids paper and pass it as your own. The rest of the established politicians I do not need to see you again. Your actions as politicians is in the public record and I can look at that record to tell me what you stand for. Any new words that are inconsistent with that record will speak louder than what is proclaimed or promised.

So In these times of intellectual blindness and emotional irrationality it becomes important that Reason should not be abandoned. And Reason has revealed the one canidate that holds a sincere motive for seeking the office of President of the USA. I Sincerely believe Andrew Yang motives are driven by his concern for his children's future and the lack of understanding what is the impending reality that is in motion. He knows that the consequence of inaction will devistate society as we know it. He not only is aware of it but has mapped out a plan to transition to a practical solution. Most of all he does not feel it something a single individual can solve, But a single individual can influence the collective to achieve the needed results. Yang is a reasonable problem solver.

He has been forthright and had not been one to promise, pander or mislead one without taking a factual and logical approach. An approach which a solution can increase the odds of a favorable outcome to occur. Unlike most politicians he is interested in solutions that can produce results. Most politicians motives revolve around their Ego and Lust for power, they will do and say what the voters want to hear to solicit their vote. After all that is said and done the Status Quo will remain. Now Let use some reason to champion UBI (Freedom Dividend). UBI is a practical solution to a factual problem.

Can we all agree that the Trickle Down Economy Myth needs to be completely Destroyed and never seen again. It's obvious that it is not wise and relies on the assumption that GREEDY CAPITALISTS will reinvest in human labor.

The facts are: Corporations, Businessman and the WEALTHY ARE NOT JOB CREATORS!!! CUSTOMERS ARE!! No Business or Corporation can exist without CUSTOMERS or Clients. You may have the Greatest Products or Services and it still will not make a difference without CUSTOMERS. If people CANNOT AFFORD your goods or services? You are Guaranteed to go OUT OF BUSINESS! Henry Ford understood this over a hundred years ago. If he paid his employees a high enough wage then in turn they will have means to purchase one of the cars they are producing. This ensured the survival of his business. Ford saw this as an investment which he would recover a large portion of that wage back to him.

Okay Everyone it's time took look at UBI for what it really represents: LEVERAGE! Everything revolves around the concept of LEVERAGE. Leverage is the SUPER POWER that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry MORE with LESS. The UBI (Freedom Dividend) really represents LEVERAGE. The $1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage their situation. Once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum. As we know leverage is the key ingredient that reduces the energy needed to overcome resistance. This effect MINIMIZES the probability of placing the burden on others. Some people like Chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery, essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage. Their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain. As everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times. This leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level. So the LARGER the GAP the more extreme the leverage becomes. The GREATEST Leverage is held by those of Hoarded Generational wealth.

Those whom are the descendants and beneficiaries of inherited wealth are The Primary group which has Stigmatized Welfare and UBI for generations. They purposely Stigmatize and cast shame on those in poverty. And what is truly disgusting is they draw pleasure from cruelly denying any form of assistance and actively work to humiliate one in order to strip them of their Human Dignity. This is due to the psychological sub-conscious projection of their own GUILT for receiving funds by BIRTHRIGHT instead of through MERIT!

Other than those Entitled Pricks there is no good reason to oppose UBI if you are a Company or Businessman. They are the ones who stand to benefit the most from UBI Because it increases the means for patrons to purchase what they are peddling. It is a true investment in the Economy rather than giving Wealthy Pricks TAX BREAKS and SUBSIDIES which ultimately causes damage to the economy by extracting the currency from circulating. It becomes hoarded and extracted, placed in an account offshore in a tax shelter. This extracted currency cannot generate anything but more Leverage sitting in a bank account. It is taken out circulation and cannot generate taxes and sales needed for a strong economy. It is Beyond Short SIGHTED to oppose UBI and favor those whom already posess Extreme levels of Leverage.

A greater WEALTH GAP will only cause DESPERATION and ANXIETY which will build even greater Economic Instability setting the conditions for Criminal behavior. A ticking time bomb which will have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of Civil Unrest. GREED AND SELFISHNESS will Blind them from the Obvious. It is Obvious to spread the wealth to generate commerce rather than to concentrate it. Otherwise, if concentrated you would be choking and Killing the Golden Goose preventing it from continuing to lay it's golden eggs. It would be much wiser to feed and look out for the Gooses best interest, you will be rewarded with a flow of Golden Eggs

Can anyone deny that $1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling. To teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind. In Fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching. And for the growing homeless population across this country, what could $1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job. Raising the Minimum Wage will not even come close to the impact of a $1000 a month will do. If fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee. This helps both Business owner and consumer by providing more money in hand to support that business with patronage.

The biggest criticism to UBI is the cost. Again this is SHORT SIGHTED blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board. Starting with the release of pressure and Anxiety that SCARCITY brings. It allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of ABUNDANCE instead of scarcity. With a SCARCITY Mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials. Not to mention the burden that Stress related illnesses caused by a Scarcity mindset places on the healthcare industry driving up higher healthcare costs. A Scarcity mindset effects businesses with LESS Patronage and taxes generated to pay for programs such as UBI. It also will lessen the burden on law enforcement and incarceration. When one is incarcerated it cost real money to feed and house them, this will only become a lesser burden on the tax payer to sustain the institution. This is an inevitable fact when Economic DESPAIR becomes magnified it starts a domino effect that crimes becomes a reality.
Desperation creates the mindset of: "if I have nothing than I have nothing to lose". The cost and burden to society would be multiple times that of the alternative of ensuring a living wage.

Ponder this:
Suppose you had $1-billion. You could spend $5,000 a day for more than 500 years before you would run out of money.
Breaking it down even farther, it means you would have to spend over $100,000 every day for the next 25 years in order to spend $1-billion.
#####
Some throw away lines but seems honest and rehearsed.
#####
Is this the 5th debate.?
#####
Im curious now. Democrats have someone with potential. I hope it will be Yang vs Trump. I really dont have a issue about Trump either so better man win.
#####
Ive begun to actively research Andrew Yang and I like I see ive had that mindset since bush 2nd term
that is the behind in technology that I feel
#####
He is so right about tech giants like amazon and google not paying their fair share of taxes. But they cause so many problems in our society. Namely, they kill moms and pops, retails. They make their employees so rich and jack up housing prices. That drive others to be homeless. Why the heck are these companies not paying fair share when the rest of us hard working middle income Americans pay 30-40% of our paychecks ???
#####
I‚Äôm republican, but if any democrat wins, I want it to be this guy.
#####
Yang is the only chance for the democrats because no one else can debate trump. But if yang gets the nomination, I think trump is at the disadvantage.
#####
HE GOT MY VOTE  !  HE'S SMART AND EDUCATED !
#####
hes my president coz hes not 70-90 years old. the youth need to take the torch to fix the problems of the youth.
#####
I'm looking for his flaws, but all I see is a man trying to make a better place for his family and this country. I don't see someone trying to play a politician I see a person who's looking to fix our economy, advance tech, and make sure kids and parents have a path to success.
#####
Wow he has got my vote!
#####
Let Yang lead us through the 4th Industrial Revolution & bring USA back to the #1 world power of technology and economics.
#####
Illegal immigrants are foreign entities meddling in are elections

If he got time same as biden he would have crushed it man üëçüòé
#####
He‚Äôs very smart and I agree what he is saying but just saying he still didn‚Äôt answer the question. (What if......)
#####
Yang mind of a child
#####
That closing statement really resonated with me. Its tough and I really don‚Äôt know what the future holds but to be told that theres people working to improve our futures and that we‚Äôll be alright is comforting.
#####
Last night i cried after watching this... he's the hero we deserve
#####
Thank you. NBC NY
#####
Andrew Yang,understood the system of USA what need to be done! Israel wish you well! Andrew!  What we want from you is to support Israel capital city Jerusalem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Mr. Yang is a problem solver! He needs to be  VP if Biden wins the Dem nom & the Presidency.
#####
I really like the 1k or 2k a month idea to raise kids.  Thats better than free higher education by far.  The only question I have is where would it come from?  What is ashame is that we are not doing it ourselves but I also realize as a homeschool father of 4 that not all families are as lucky as mine to have a working spouse with a good job.  We also get 1k a kid back in taxes... it would be nice to see that as 4-5 k each kid but having to be invested into the kids future "IE small part going towards college savings etc" and not the local liquor store.
#####
As a canadian, Donald Trump has completely fucked up diplomacy with so many countries. We are close to another cold war with Russia/China/North Korea. He needs restore diplomacy with the allies. The fact that hes even proposing data and privacy laws is amazing. I BET you ANYTHING big companies like google, Amazon, facebook and every other website taking our data is going to donate against him. Americans and everyone who wants to help needs to donate to him so he can fight the corrupt companies who are inevitably funding his opponents.
#####
he the candidate of the future really . I hope hes more successful next time. Technology is the answer to our problems .
#####
It really would break my heart if he doesn't become our president one day.
#####
But I really hope Donald trump will get re-elected though, and Andrew/tulsi can  be a president  in 2024
#####
Andrew Yang is very smart
#####
This guy will destroy trump if he goes goes 1vs1 with him .
#####
Mr. Yang is awesome
#####
Andrew Yang is correct about having parents/a parent staying home with children instead sending them off to the workforce. I was fortunate to have my mother stay at home so I always had someone to depend on when I came home from school. I felt safer, I was cared for, and emotionally and mentally, I think it helped me develop as a person. Please, we need a President who understands the root of our issues starting with how American families are developing individually and as a group. üá∫üá∏‚ù§
#####
How long are these debates? Seven minutes don't seem like much.
#####
Don‚Äôt know about you guys but I‚Äôd probably vote for Yang if he somehow became the Democrat Nominee.

Not left or right but forward

ang yes please solve the problem trump made high employment strong borders strong defense first

Wow...
 Ladies and gentlemen...
  Mr. Andrew Yang!
 Biden and Bernie need...NEED to just joust eachother for VP and put their combined efforts behind this guy. 
 Yang speaks with urgency and desire both of which resonate with many, many people, myself included.
 This guy is (so farüòö) a class act.

I like him, but I don't think he'll win because he's not getting enough media coverage at the moment. Not enough people are seeing the value he will bring. He'll really have to take the spotlight in next week's presidential debate.

I can say, and believe it, that Yang will be one of the greatest presidents in history.

Btw he should be on the $1000 bill

#####
Why is nobody relating any of the problems of the West back to question and ask how we can change our economic systems? Putting bandaids on the wounds caused by capitalism while that very capitalism keeps slashing more and more wounds into society won't heal anything. First you eliminate the threat (which is a capitalist, free market economy), then you start applying bandages, then you start the healing process (which is gonna take decades).

wish i could vote for yang

Andrew yang might be the first president that gets americans to make the change from motor vehicles to bicycles i love it

Could he/she repeal it.

56:00 that guy still doesn‚Äôt get it. Read Rich Dad Poor Dad and you‚Äôll see why taxing the rich doesn‚Äôt work. Yang‚Äôs plan is it. Out of all the dems, including Bernie, Yang is the best choice.

I‚Äôm voting Yang because my mom needs that $1,000 a month.
#####
Nobody ate the Bao! I hope they ate those yummy bao - since you were at the Baodega

Nope! You do not take from those who have the most.  The VAT tax is right. keep money in wealthy people‚Äôs hands and enable the poor to earn wealth as well. That basic income gives that opportunity.
#####
When did Andrew talk about his favorite anime? What did he say?
#####
I don't think a freedom dividend or UBI would address inequities. But if one has a question about HUD or Education - those are separate to the UBI. I have seen that a private company wants to build a building complex and include in the design a certain percentage of homes for low income families. Those plans cannot get approved by the local council. If the federal government worked with the state and local governments to get low income homes included in designs of buildings... but we always get into the fight between state rights and federal rights and local government rights. Same goes with schools. It is a challenge... but something that needs addressing... like making federal funding of housing and schools dependant on addressing inequality. But the UBI policy won't do that for us. UBI addresses personal freedoms.
#####
All the examples of countries that have a VAT (Canada, Germany, UK, etc.) have economies that are either moribund or sluggish.  Compare that to the strength and vitality of the US economy.  No thanks VAT.

"Humanity for Yang"? lol. AY is essentially a Socialist. Secular humanist Socialism is responsible for hundreds of MILLIONS of human deaths in LESS than a century, and counting, along with untold suffering and economic destruction. So much for thinking ...
#####
These naysayers on the cost of his UBI program are uninformed it will be paid for by the very companies that make this technology to destroy jobs for people around the world the corporations that profit from this should pay all the tax for the huge windfall they will be making.

Hey John,  why try to take 100% of the money needed for his program from 1% of the population, doesn't it make more sense to take a small bite from everyone equally??   Doesn't this work all over Europe??

Socialism doesn't work! Corruption destroy it quickly, the government in charge becomes the elite, with military backing and lack of popular vote, it becomes a dictatorship.

This is not right, double talk! We are over 70 Trillion in debt we need 70 Trillion in credits. simply accounting! Tell me how we get our country back or vote for Yang to be the president of China where you and your children are slaves to the FED indefinitely! He doesn't have the answers for you future.  Dark Horse indeed.
#####
I am FAR from a Democrat, I do mean far but I wish other Democrats would follow this mans example.  They are focused on scams and ridiculous actions vs actually focusing on the issues that mean something for this country.  Even If I don't vote for this man I will not be sad or worried if he wins.  This is a good man with good morals.

Noel King what a poor host...    NPR is not what it was, especially when you take money from the Kochs... dont believe me look it up.. Yang is a great candidate Bernie and Tulsi or Bernie and Andrew 2020

#####
I don't trust him
#####
The biggest problem with Yang is that he is pro Nuclear energy.  No way!  With the environment being more and more unstable:  more earthquakes, fires, floods, droughts, tsunamis, etc., we cannot afford the risk: NO NUCLEAR!

Perhaps if he dropped nuclear and teamed up with Sanders.

It is STUPID to close clothing stores.  How are we supposed to try on clothes and see if it fits and looks well?  I'd rather go to a store, try something on, buy it, take it home, and wear it.  Order from Amazon, you wait for the delivery so you must plan ahead, and if it doesn't fit or looks awful, you have to box it back up, re-ship it and wait for a refund.  No thanks!
#####
He's polling 4th nationally as of today!
#####
Actually, V.A.Tax is put on top of price of all goods and service consumed in the economy by individuals and companies. Every company must transfer collected VAT to the tax office, but can subtract amount paid to other subjects. So, in theory businesses end up paying only the difference of the value they added to the product or service they sold. The problem is that end customer (so called physical person) does not get reimbursed and pays end product VAT in full. If the car costs 20 k USD before VAT, regular consumer pays E.g. 20+10% VAT = 22 k USD. The VAT is basically paid by ordinary people to the government, because business just increase the price of the goods and services by that percentage that they every month transfer to government. The tricky part is administrating the VAT returns to businesses in a way that it is not subject of fraudulent over-reimbursements.
#####
I'm just looking at those dumplings that are just sitting on the tableüòÇ

I‚Äôve really enjoyed this video, I‚Äôve learned so much about Andrew Yang and his plans for our country. Yang 2020 üëåüèΩüëçüèΩ
#####
The thing about VAT is that the ultimate goal is to tax the consumer. The only thing companies such as google, amazon and so forth, would be subject to is the accounting administration of this tax. It may be that there is some other type of VAT he is proposing. However, in a country like Sweden, for example, the companies are exempted from this tax in their b2b transactions and only "harbour" the money until EOY where they net their "outgoing VAT" against their "incoming VAT" and pays the net amount (the amount they have been "harbouring" from the consumption).

I don't quite see how this would affect the companies in question because as I understand it the intention is to have these companies paying these taxes. I do, however, see how it could play a role in equalizing the income gap with carefully orchestrated VAT on certain consumption. Therefore, I believe it is a viable system just not quite as it is advertised.
#####
A VAT tax versus a wealth tax? I say do both! Because a VAT tax impacts a company and consumers - and a wealth tax efects the 1%ers... but the tax method misses the important factor - once you get the tax dollars what do you spend it on? Do you do what Trump did and give 1.2 Trillion dollars to corporations and the 1% or do you do what Mr. Yang wants and give it to the hard working people of America? The 48 white guy is worried that his Sony TV or PS4 will cost him more... and they should - because they are not must have's... but he will have the freedom dividend so it will balance out. they only difference is that companies that pay 0% in tax will actually have to start paying tax. And that makes sense... unless he is cool with the CEO of Google and Amazon just getting richer and richer and richer - without paying any tax for this gain in wealth?
#####
this woman seems to be throwin shade over here
#####
Limp dick government zombies picking up their checks as big daddy govt rules your life. Men work and create destiny. Liberals are so sickening no real men. Yang is smart,but not in reality,
#####
I just published a data dashboard at www.pubvi.com to show the Freedom Dividend‚Äôs impact for everyday Americans. $1K/adult covers the avg housing & food expenses of 59% of US households, even more in battleground states. That‚Äôs net of VAT and welfare, and using real data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Check it out!
#####
We can not say that the dividen would make housing prices and other cost go up. It may actually make costs go down because businesses wouldn't have to charge as much to make ends meet.
#####
Those disliked are from Bernie and Warren supporters ü§£ü§£ü§£This guy is talking about facts and logic and reality of things that are happening in USA !!

Can anyone tell me how is he going get the $1000 a month for every 18+ people?

I live in Canada and it is a welfare state... now Trudeau is toying the Idea of UBI( not really sure if Canada really needs it or its just to get him votes). I have friends who are social workers and I cannot tell you how many people ABUSE THE SYSTEM ... they start out as hardworking diligent people but fall victim to unfortunate life circumstances.....  - addictions / accident/ ailments and soon have to depend on Govt. for basic needs..... now the kicker here is even if they come out of lets say depression they get ADDICTED TO DOLE OUTS and handouts..... their whole outlook towards life changes....its a deeply socio-psychological issue and an experiment like UBI at best needs to be carried out in a controlled environment..You are essentially trying to reverse Evolutionary  Human instincts and behaviors through the results of one election  and  someone fighting  an election based on this and implement it at a national level.... then God Bless America....ask people of Eastern Europe, they are still picking up fragments of their shattered past from the great Marxist Experiment.

#Yang2020

Love his ideas. However I  wish the requirement to receive any money would be to take a budgeting class. Corporations are going to prey on the weak and  make sure people spend that  money.  How many people  get tax refunds and spend it on bs every year?
#####
Yang is not remotely presidential material
He's been using his wife to get sympathy votes
Ridiculous fool trying to bullshit us all at a go
#####
Yang is smart, but I hope he's wise. 

$3trillion in additional taxes is required to give 255million adult citizens $1000 monthly in 2020. 
 
To take one target-audience into question, how is "they who buy luxury goods" defined? Luxury is subjective. Some folks pay $5,000 for a purse that costs $1500 to manufacture; some pay $500 for a purse that costs $150 to manufacture. Both of these are luxury items. When the "luxury manufacturer" is taxed more on their profit, they then simply charge $800 for the purse that still costs $150 to manufacture - because, in business, the bottom-line stays the same. Since this is all about heavier tax on big corporate profit, then your average $25,000 family car becomes $55,000. Do you think a working-class family who already pays $2,000 (8%) in tax on their $25,000 car will take kindly to paying $6,600 (12%) tax on their now $55,000 family car? $1,000 a month won't do much to off-set the cost of businesses charging you more to maintain their bottom-line, while you're also taxed more because your Ford Fusion is suddenly a "luxury item" furnishing your "elitism". Before you know it, technology and manufacturing takes a nose-dive till we're riding bicycles and drinking soup in cafeterias. I understand that for some this is a Utopian future. 

I don't recommend letting the government define what's non-essential for you... do you like organically grown tropical fruit? Luxury item! Like grass-fed New Zealand beef? Luxury item! Prefer the intrinsic value of human endeavor? Luxury item!

Andrew Yang has it right UBI but he is not the only ones to back this concept. It may surprise you to learn that the Federal Reserve and UBI was discussed at the at the bilderberg group by Guy Standing. If was discussed there the infamous secret meeting of the world elite, then you can count on it coming to fruition. Guy Standing make the best case for UBI, He is an economist and first advocated a universal basic income (UBI) ‚Äì a regular unconditional sum paid to all adults regardless of employment status ‚Äì he was considered quixotic (where quixotic is a synonym for ‚Äúa crackpot‚Äù). When his book The Precariat ‚Äì which identified an emerging class of people whose lives were diminished by short-term and zero hours contracts ‚Äì was published in 2011.
Guy Standing ted talk about UBI is needed:

Enno Schmidt discusses the possibilities of UBI - who has said "Everybody is for UBI but they do not know it yet"

Has anyone thought to bring back the CCC to employ unemployed youth for some infrastructure and polution control ect this would give many poor youth a job history to be avalable for their 2nd job.

I feel in the future, these kinds of informal, long form conversation formats will supplant the "town hall" presentation of question and answer model we've become accustomed to. As people become more an integral part of and interactive with the content they consume, voters will increasingly demand it. Despite the impossibility of even a fraction of voters engaging in these kinds of discussions, they can provide an antidote the phoniness of the typical political "personality" that's become anathema to voters.

I don't think Yang has much of a shot this cycle, but I suspect some victorious candidate in the not-so-distant future will use this medium to provide the winning edge. Historically, electoral successes owe as much to effective communication as to actual policy prescriptions. People care about policy, but oftentimes that policy only makes sense if you appreciate a certain world view or framework; effective articulation of the whole of that framework animates policy platforms whereas merely stating them often provides a hostile response from those who do not already share that world view.

I appreciate #yanggang for it's impact on the discourse itself: our political process, country and culture are not simply who wins an office or has the gavel this year. It's our collective conversation, and it continues with or without the consent of the elected. Our nation lives so long as that conversation does.

We have to becareful with the freedom benifit, that we don't causr a jump ininflation as merchants may jump up prices to sweep extra profit.

I liked this guy because he is smart, cares about people -has proved it with a nonprofit- he looks to the future( that is starting now) but now he rides bikes(puts his money where his mouth is..
#####
So what I'm curious about is when we tax the big companies that pay nothing in taxes, which is great my opinion, what stops them from raising the prices on everything we buy to get that money back they are losing?
#####
Andrew Yang is the most reasonable, logical candidate.. If Americans are watching him, they better vote... He is easily the most worthy candidate
#####
Hey guys check this out a new song for Mr Andrew Yang #yang2020 https://youtu.be/K3Hw7-xcFFw

Why do these questions they ask seem like they're trying to trip him up?
#####
$1,000.00 a month is like $6.25 an hour for an average of a full time job. It will also raise the price of transportation, food, and security issues. Plus it will help addicts to buy more illegal drugs and guns.

I think more people would watch these if they were 50% shorter. I want to hear Yangs views specifically about American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) treaties which are being drastically changed by Trump. He is mixing the AI/AN treaties (Indian Health Services) with veteran benefits. This is concerning because guess  who gets preferential care at the places?

Because the numbers show that a Value Added Tax raises three times the amount of a wealth tax. --paraphrased Yang
Guy sticking to his notes--But why don't you support a wealth tax? 
Taxing 0's and 1's

Not having democracy at work, in housing and everywhere in-between is very expensive; so how do you plan on paying for it?
#####
Wealth tax is ridiculous. Why take more from the people who took the risks to get where they are today? Quit trying to take from the rich. They worked unbelievably hard to get where they are by making great business decisions and huge risks with huge downside potential. You can say "Oh well, they inherited their money, so they were born rich." But only 12% of all millionaires inherited their wealth.
#####
According to 2019 US population It‚Äôs actually about 250 million ppl over age of 18 in US and x $12000 a year that‚Äôs about 3 trillion dollars a year !!!  And the entire US budget deficit in 2019 is just about 1 trillion dollars which is already killing our economy . SO Where the hell are we suppose to get that 3 trillion dollars PER YEAR to pay for this universal income....? From amazon and google and Apple ..? They can go bankrupt and not even pay close to Andrews number ! 
Andrew yang i love the idea and all but you must be smoking crack or something here.....

Amazing interview and Andrew Yang nailed every question asked of him with a very thought through answers and solutions. Besides, he is not playing games to impress voters like other candidates do. If he poles in the top three, I would vote for him. Finally, we will have a very intelligent person running for office without pretenses. The sound of President Yang feels good.
#####
I  will ALWAYS remember Yang as this typical scenario I'm seeing‚Ä¶
*Yang:* busting out laughing, at either some irony or ridiculousness of some stats he's throwing out
*Listeners:* crickets and mouths kinda hangin down.                       hahaha love it. It's like ALL THE TIME.

The more I hear from Andrew Yang, the more I like him! Great interview. :D

Thought I was already done with the Andrew Yang binge

France has repealed wealth tax and now there are thousands of people protesting in the streets every saturday for more than a year. The french gouvernement removed this tax (4 billions euros/ a year) because they said the rich were hidding their assets not to pay it instead of looking for the money in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Monaco, etc.
#####
This dude can definitely make America cool again.
#####
Andrew Yang is the TRUTH! I'm 50 years old and have never donated cash to a political campaign. Haven't voted in over 10 years.  I consider most, if not ALL politicians to be corporate shills and lap dogs for billionaires/millionaires. They get elected by saying all the right things that the 95% want to hear and then doing NOTHING once they're elected. They can always blame the other side for the failure and gridlock. The truth is both democrats and republicans work for big business and special interests. Yang is the only one that I've heard that has real solutions. I will vote for him and contribute to his campaign. Please, everyone VOTE FOR YANG 2020!!
#####
The only thing that I don't agree with his view on is "hey, let's move this town." A town is not just people and possessions. A town is a yard, a favorite tree, graveyards, churches, historical buildings and places. You cannot move towns. You can move people, but not towns. And it's time that people understood that man-made climate change will erase big chunks of our American life and history.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
I'm for the spirit of Andrew yang. Sorry yang gang (lol) Andrew is not it..

Disappointing
#####
So misleading he did even officially endorse yang
#####
Andrew  Yang has gotten tremendous youth support harnessing the power of internet to generate his online presence, and any pop culture artiste that thrives on the gen youth fan base ,understands also the power of the internet, and youth  pop culture stars  who supports Andrew will stand to gain millions of  immense dedicated fans , who can be as  fanatical and dedicated to them ,as they are to Andrew as Yang Gangers .
 Internet sensation Andrew is clearly making history in having his support of the Internet and that makes him a pioneer of becoming the 1st US President boosted into office via mobilizing the power of the Internet and not conventional mass media.
And that is the ultimate  irony because Andrew also has declared himself  to be a tech and digital age persona and that his campaign also revolves around navigating challenges of 21st century digital  infomation age  and AI

#####
No one should be surprised that most wealthy celebrities aren't supporting the guy who will raise their taxes (Sanders). Yang's biggest idea (UBI) is funded by a VAT tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. Not to mention that he fails to adequately address the underlying issues that are causing the wealth and income divide that has ravaged the American working class. HINT: it's not just AI and automation. There are MANY structural problems in our economic and social systems that Yang simply fails to even discuss, either because he doesn't understand them or he realized that his plan doesn't address them. No one understands the depth and severity of the problems we face better than Sanders and he has solid solutions as well. Of course, you can disagree, but my mind is made up. I'm all in for Sanders, as is everyone I know.

Watch some of Yang's talks and interviews (pick something at least 40 minutes long) and you will end up endorsing Yang too!

Donald Glover realized the truth:

Yang‚Äôs Freedom Dividend plan is to pay out a Universal Basic Income (UBI) with a Value-added tax (VAT), which is a consumption tax placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the supply chain, from production to the point of sale.

A VAT tax has already been applied to the supply chain in over 140 countries around the world, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, & the United Kingdom.
 
There is even a form of a VAT tax already in Alaska and Puerto Rico.

It would take a 31% to 40% VAT on almost everything people spend money for, to make this work. It would take 31% VAT on most goods and services and on data, plus the savings from other welfare programs to give 200M of the 247, 813,910 estimated adults in the US, $1000/mo. To fund all the adults would take 40%.  Please check this and tell me if you find errors. MATH ‚ò∫

How much is needed to give everyone $1000/mo?

‚û°To give every estimated adult in the US,  $1000/mo, then $3T per year is needed.

247,813,910 √ó $12000 = $2,973,766,920,000 which rounds to $3T is needed.

What would it cost for 200M to receive $1000/mo?

‚û°To give 200M people $1000/mo, then $2.4T is needed.

 200M √ó $12,000 = 2,4000,000,000,000,  $2.4T needed.

Since VAT is a consumer tax let's look at how much consumers spent to find out how much revenue could be made by taxing it. (Business to business transactions unless one is the final customer yield 0% VAT revenue. A short video that gives a simple explanation of how this works in the EU is, "What is VAT and how does it work? Will's Whiteboard" The channel is Avalara. )

The total consumer spending for 2018, was $12.9T. If we subtract housing (2.2T), healthcare (2.2), food (1T), and clothes (0.4), then we are left with  $7.1T. Let's  take 10% of that. It's .$0.7T.  (710B) 

So the amount generated from taxing 10% of all goods and services except rent/mortgage, groceries, clothes, and medical, would be $710B. That's still taxing 10% of every pizza order, Netflix, car payment, home repair, vacation, haircut, yachts, etc equals $710B. ($0.7T)

If there was a Data tax. Data is between 100B to 200B industry, now. Let's say 200B. 10% of 200B is $20B. ($0.02T)

So now we have 710B + 20B =730B.  

‚û°Let's figure in government savings from other welfare programs. The freedom-dividend website figured out the amount from savings on welfare programs to be $161.57B. The UBI Center figured the number to be 151B. We'll take the $161.57B for this estimate.

 161.57B+730B = 891.57B

Now the new total is 891.57B

‚û°The revenue generated from 10% VAT + 10% DataTax + gov't savings = $891.56B

Let's suppose everyone opted in how much would that give each one per month?

$891.57B  √∑ 257,813,910 = $3597.74 √∑12 = $299.81/mo

What about if only 200M people opt in?

891.57B √∑200M = $4457.85 √∑12= $371/mo

‚û°What would it take with a VAT and data tax, plus savings from welfare to get the $2.4T, so 200M people could opt in?

 7.1T consumer spending + 0.2T(data) √ó .31(VAT) = 2.26T + 0.16157T (savings) = $2.4T

It would take savings from existing welfare programs plus a 31%VAT on data and 31% on every good and service except health care, rent/mortgage, food and clothes to get the number close to the $2.4T. The amount needed to give 200M people a check for $1000/mo

The 31% VAT would cut consumer sales, so I doubt it would work out to actually generate that amount, though. 

The US Census Bureau estimates there are 247,813,910 of adults in US, (not all are citizens). How many would opt in? If everyone did. It would be ~ $3T in checks sent out. ($29,737,669,200,000)

‚û°What would it require for every adult to get $1000/mo? 

7.1T(consumer spending) + 0.2T (data) √ó .40 (VAT)  + .16157 (gov't savings) = $3.0T
So it would take a 40% VAT on  most spending and on data plus the savings from welfare.

People would run out of money to buy things and not buy enough to fund it if there was a 31% to 40% VAT.

Another thing that would work mathematically is if prices were was 3 to 4 times higher and then a 10% VAT was added onto the price. People would run out of money first .

Another mathematical option is for everyone to buy 3 to 4 times more of almost everything. People would run out of money first.

If it remained at 10% and was therefore, not fully funded, it would require borrowing money and giving that borrowed money to the consumers to spend. Beside increasing the $22T national debt that has to be paid back with interest to bond holders, it requires increasing the money supply or "printing money" and handing it out. This causes inflation. Prices rise. 

If over 2/3 of the $2.4T to $3T is unfunded that means over 2/3 of it is printed money dumped into the consumer market.  At the top amount that would be 2T more money into a $12.9T consumer market place. That would make the dollar worth less. Like anything else, scarcity makes something more valuable and excess diminishes the value of it.

It creates "too much money chasing too few goods" which is the definition of inflation. (Prices rise)

Consumers having this much more money would cause a lot more demand for goods and services than supply. That makes prices rise to cut the demand to a more manageable amount for suppliers to meet. How much would prices rise?  They could rise a lot especially in things like rent, used car prices, vacations spots, and highly sought after items like designer athletic shoes. 

To see how demand and supply effect prices, Economist Thursday, in 2014,  made a cartoon video to explain why it doesn't work to hand out money to everyone.  It Is a short engaging video, that explains this. I put it on a playlist, too, if you're interested. It's called, "Why Don't We Print More Money?" It focuses more on the demand and supply cause of the prices rising than the money printing part of it. For that apart, I like  the video "Inflation explained in 1 minute", by One Minute Economist . 

They are both oversimplified, but informative. IMO. Both are on a playlist on my channel with videos explaining how the VAT in the EU works, if you want easy access to them. Don't worry, I don't make videos. These aren't partisan videos. They were all made prior to the election cycle. ‚ò∫

PS. How much would administration costs be? I didn't include them because I didn't know how to make an accurate estimate. Any ideas for doing this? 

This involves dealing with all the companies to collect it and audit it, prevent fraud, and screen applicants, distribute it accurately to every eligible adult who opts in and get funds from other welfare programs. 

Also fraud. How much would fraud cost? How to prevent it?
#####
Only smart and pure thinking,not politics can and will make America  Dream comes true. All the way with Yang!
#####
He is the Democrat that can appeal to the republican voters. If yang don't win the democratic, those Republicans are gonna vote trump and the dem nom has a lower chance to win
#####
Basically every Democrat planning to vote for a democratic candidate will vote for one of the democratic leaders against trump. But the man with the most Republican voters would vote for besides trump is Yang. DO THE MATH!
#####
And he likes earl grey tea... My man.. You already got my support already, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO LIKEABLE BY ME!!!
#####
Yanggang member from the Netherlands. Can't vote, but I share my support
#####
GrandFuckin'Master Yang!!! #yanggang
#####
Yang is the candidate that we wish we had back in 2016. We didn't want to vote for Hillary and we also didn't want to vote of Trump. 
He's the hero we need and deserve.
#####
I'm voting for Yang. CBS, not so much.

Yang, The best Communist member of the Democrats.
#####
I love all his ideas. Many countries already have a VAT but will that thousand dollars be eaten up by the VAT? He is still the best candidate Republican or Democrat. We need modern forward thinker. Not more of the same .
#####
It must be Yang
#####
Unfair cuts. Listen to full interviews, Google Yang yourself, don't trust corporate media with hidden agendas.
#####
I remember the day when JFK was killed I felt so betrayed bye politics I didn't know who to trust anymore .  With Mr Andrew Yang it is different .  I really know that he cares about his family and his country .  And I really need the extra income to become mentally healthyer and to try to keep strong .  No more crap crammed down our throats without a choice .          gb*      Mr Andrew Yang for President in 2020      ~                   hard life         (MULDEW)

Mr. Yang,
   The reason I support you isn‚Äôt because I necessarily believe in the freedom dividend. I think it‚Äôs a very interesting idea and it could work. However, I‚Äôm not qualified to say. However, I do believe you have correctly identified the problem which is the vast automation of all low skilled labor in the United States. It‚Äôs a profound insight, you are correct and, you‚Äôre the only candidate on the field who makes sense.  I‚Äôm fully behind you.
           -John
#####
Shouldn't those jobs move into service jobs instead of nothing?
#####
And he kisses his rice cooker  with that egotistical mouth?
#####
You can do math, vulgarity is no substitute for wit. ü§®
#####
The VAT on automated goods and services like online shopping, electronics and other luxury goods will incentivize people to shop local over online as well as pay for the Freedom Dividend. This will increase local consumption, which will create millions of jobs for local commerce like daycare workers, mechanics, plumbers, waiters and other jobs that won't be replaced by automation any time soon. Yang's Freedom Dividend and VAT will create millions of real organic local jobs instead of made up federal jobs.

As for the future of automation, as automation advances and continues to produce more of the goods and services within the economy, the VAT on those goods and services will generate more revenue which means the Freedom Dividend will increase proportionally with automation over time. The Freedom Dividend and VAT literally makes automation work for Americans instead of for a handful of billionaires. As the Freedom Dividend continues to allow Americans to keep local commerce booming, there will be millions of local jobs in the meantime. By the time automation reaches the point where it can do even local jobs like daycare, plumbing, waitressing, etc., the VAT on automated goods and services will already be generating enough revenue to be paying Americans several thousands of dollars a month through the Freedom Dividend. This is how we turn automation from a problem into a solution. This is how we transition into a post-scarcity economy and usher in an age of unheard of entrepreneurship, community building, charity work, research and science, art and philosophy.
#####
The whole fucken war in Iraq costed us Anerican taxpayers 7 trillion dollars you clown!   And you think that 1.3 dollars that will go back to our economy in taxes and wages is unrealistic you clown?
#####
They will not let him make policy!  The freedom dividend takes money from mega corporations and they do not permit  that!
#####
Yang is playing Santa to win an election. His unstated purpose is to expropriate all the middle class people like me. When he's taken everything we have, and destroyed the productive class in this country, he will simply print money.
His freeloader supporters will stick with him as long as that check keeps coming, however little it will buy.
#####
Amazing how many yang gangsters on here backing him up on cbs own channel that‚Äôs making him look bad. Obviously he is backed by more than the media is letting on. Honestly people just never sat and listened to a 10 minute video about how cool of a potus this man will be. Also a guy like me who never voted is donating and voting. I bet there will be a lot of first timers casting ballots !

Really glad this guy is getting coverage now!

I hate when they say how much it would cost how about how much this war has cost us since Sept 11, 2001. I joined the Army Sept 11, 2000 a year later we went to war my daughter was born Sept 7, 2000 we have been at war since she was born and she is now 19. Dont tell me we cant afford it and we still are paying for the war.

Many decades and dems presidents have come and go they all promised to end poverty but more and more Americans are getting poorer and have been neglected. Yang will improve the lives of the Americans.

Funny how every demonrat debate has been won by .........Trump

#####

#####
Chances arent that low, lets propose for one second that we vote top 5 today: Sanders, Biden, Warren, Buttigeg, Yang, Divide amongst them the blue states and their all fairly equal, Decide the red states and you have a much narrower choice between Yang and someone else, remember, Yang is one of two canidates with more then 10% of Trump supporters, thats 50% chance of winning 10% of the states, which means Yang if elected nominee would win all the blue states and 20 to 30% of the Red states with the other ex Trump supporters who no longer follow one of the other dems now that their out of the race, giving him a much higher advantage against Trump, not so unlikely now
#####
Yang is thinkiing out of the box if multinational data firms get money from our information should the originators of that data be compensated
#####
4:26 This advisor has a problem saying 2.4 Trillion dollars to help Americans. But has no issue with bailing out Wall Street with 4 TRILLION dollars without national debate. On top of that, TRILLION dollar American online companies are paying NO TAXES? Guess who's payroll he's on. Hmmm.....
#####
Keep giving him airtime. We love Yang
#####
I hate when politicians run for president, they do what the rich CEOs want them to do.

What a waste of funds.

It almost physically hurts me to continue seeing him under double digits.

So UBI is being paid for by us through retail taxes. Nothing is free. Don't be fooled. Look at countries that have tried it. IT FAILS!!! Because alot of people don't spend their money wisely. That is why there is over a billion dollars in credit card debt.

i can't believe people are rejecting $1000/month to vote for someone other then yang

Yang is whats gonna make America great cares for humanity I love being a us citizen can‚Äôt wait for yang

IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also, make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Please LIKE this comment to make sure the message gets delivered :)

As a Trump supporter I find Yang interesting.
#####
Is the Yang gang same as occupy Wallstreet?

Yang is the only real competition to Trump at this point and the DNC will push Warren. Come back in 2024 Yang and it‚Äôs yours for the taking. 

Signed, a trump voter.

#####
He makes sense.
#####
Andrew Yang has done the MATH!!
#####
hey yang gang! he needs 40000 before the tonight's debate and he only needs 783 left before tonight at 8pm, let's do this!
#####
Yang doesn't even get it.  He has to RENAME capitalist consumerism into something else.  YES, he is all about humanity first, BUT capitalism is NOT about humanity first it's about individuals over the group.  What Yang wants to do is change capitalism, not radically like communism but it's still a HUGE change.  So he needs to RENAME his form of capitalism and stop saying he likes capitalism the way it is because HE AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS DO NOT.  And they don't understand this.  GDP= health and life expectancy?  That IS NOT capitalism at it's purest.  So he should RENAME his form of capitalism whether it's "human first capitalism" or something else it must be renamed from capitalist consumerism because ALL ELSE FOLLOWS.  Behavior follows the values of a culture
#####
CBS is very misleading on the VAT tax part. They make it look like essentials are taxed from talking about it during a Target purchase... If they cared to research Yangs policy, they‚Äôd see that clothing and groceries are not included
#####
‚Äúunlikely campaign‚Äù... CBS y‚Äôall be hating, lmao!

#####
Thank you for covering @andrewyang #yanggang #yang2020
We are just going to prove to all that he is for real, electable and the perfect person to beat Donald Trump. #humanityfirst
#####
Don't believe the polls!  LOL remember when HIllary was projected to win?

Trust your eyes -- obviously Yang is the favorite candidate (this is also confirmed by Google Trends and search histories)

I think we can be sure that Yang has a chance to win so much of the popular vote, even the delegates can't pick Trump.  I mean popular vote vs. delegates vote doesn't always match, but if Yang can win by a landslide they'll have no choice.

LOL at CBS's bias title "unlikely campaign" STFU CBS
#####
American people from the left and right are so sick  of the political establishment. Out of the three anti-establishment candidates, Bernie, Tulsi, and Yang, Yang is the only one who will beat Trump.
#####
He did the math I did the math we all did the math if he doesn‚Äôt get the nominee then trump wins in a landslide election the only people who haven‚Äôt done the math is the people who don‚Äôt know who he is and the media who omits him from their polls

#####
I love him
#####
I'm convinced the only reason Yang isn't winning by a landslide is because not enough people knows he exists or even follow politics; that girl from the clip is a prime example. His ideas probably resonate with most people in the country, but ~40% of our population don't even know who's campaigning. If Yang wins, half the nation will think he's some random easter bunny, because no one paid attention.

Andrew yang from my understanding is basically saying humans are outdated, we can't out think and out perform technology. That humans need a hand out from technology companies. That humans are a drag to technology. For example, he said that not everyone wants to use computers or program or work with technology.
#####
#yanggang2020
#####
saying yang is bashing big tech is like saying a sex educator is bashing sex for telling you to have safe sex.
#####
If he doesnt get the nomination
democrates will lose

if we do not put humanity first, all average people will become slaves  of technology and be controlled by a small group of people with powers.

I always love how media just always use strong/slightly pushy words when Andrew Yang is the last person to really "bash" anyone at all even if they're dipshits. Yang is not here to bash, he's here to be informative rather than being opinionated all the time.

"Bash..." Um, he understands technology and sees what needs to happen in order that tech doesn't leave humanity in the dust.

He never bashed them. He bashed corrupt companies and countries taking advantage of automation at the risk of people's employment. He also ran against Amazon's not paying their fair share in taxes. So I don't know why CBS thinks all of Silicon Valley are a hivemind that get offended when he bash a Facebook or Amazon.
#####
Register Dem and Vote Yang!
#####
Support for Yang from Italy ‚úåÔ∏è
#####
Like Elon Musk has endorsed him. He's not bashing, he's speaking for many of the leaders of "big" tech who want regulation AND to pay their share of taxes.
#####
Silicon valley love him because those people create the robot and can envision problems when thos robots take over people's job.

But they can't stop building because it is what it is..big tech company has invested tons of money since 20-30 years ago for the project. And due date to go live is only couple more years..

That's why they love Yang, because Yang can speak the concern and Yang try to actively find solution and create middle ground between Tech savvy and people

5:09 Nick Thompson-"He is one of the last ones standing".                                                                And I say- Andrew Yang is the last one standing.
#####
He is an entrepreneur who has a good understanding of technology and science and its effects on society and average people.  He is bashing Google, Amazon and so on but his UBI plan will make them even much more money than before but at the same time bringing more benefits to the average people.  If the executives are as smart as they claim on their resume then they should endorse his plan.
#####
üß¢ Amazon is portrayed not so much as the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô by Yang, rather as taking advantage of capitalism, but now it is time to regulate it and relieve the financial and workload of the American peopleüññ #HumanityFirst
#####
He does not bash tech or it‚Äôs advancements. He explains how they will impact us and the economy. Warns us to prepare now. He does t want to stop or slow innovation.
#####
Andrew Yang knows what's happening, yesterday, today, and tomorrow!
#####
He is not attacking techs. Its truth and reality, and everyone knows it! Everyone understands it once yang explains it.
#####
Nick Thompson is wrong in his lack luster research on Yang regarding his high technology knowledge.
#####
Yang will make America better
#####
Well take . It is becoming kind of rare when so called intelligent and educated people talk intelligently.
#####
When did Andrew Yang ever bash big Tech?
#####
The media doesn't know other words but "bash"
#####
God this woman is putting me to sleep
#####
Andrew Yang was made for such a time as this. None of the other candidates were addressing the perils of AI & automation. The 4th Industrial Rev was under the radar.
#####
He is not a pessimist. He is a REALIST. 
Do NOT underestimate the collaboration of AI, quantum computing and robotics.
#####
We‚Äôre gonna YangBang the vote in 2020üëçüèø
#####
Not left, not right, forward.
#####
Mastering the internet? I think people just support him.
Also I feel that the support he gets on the internet speaks louder than polls, which are over glorified imo.
(Since polls are gathered from landlines and not many people uses landlines anymore)
#####
Yang 2020
#####
This title is such crap. We see what you did CBS.
#####
Where talking about the next President of the United States, don't mind the noise in the background. Good job.
#####
Everything is pretty much imported here from China, Yang was born here in NY, parents are from Taiwan, not China. Most American-made candidates are faulty like the one in the Oval office, Yang has my vote.
#####
Next President Andrew Yang not only has a huge brain, hugely important has a big heart also. In recent history all america voters get nothing but empty promises. With Andrew Yang we as voters get for the first time solid dividend from the country.
#####
Why wouldn't they support him?  He has said that he won't do anything about tech monopolies with the facile comment 'it's all about the app'.  Any criticism of big tech is just window dressing for a horrible product so far as big tech is concerned.
He has some good policies.  He is the best on drugs and his freedom dividend is a good idea both to get people involved in politics and to remove corruption, but his bad ideas are as bad as his good ideas are good.
#####
UBI...this is something alaska is doing today. this is something republicans try to offer 4/5 decades ago? this is something martin luther king tried to offer. this is something elon musk is 100% for. so if OIL is working for the people of Alaska...why couldn't technology work for the rest of Americans? This is what yang is preaching with UBI.

Correction: Yang doesn‚Äôt bash anyone.

Would love to hear that strong counter argument, becuase this is already a game changing technology.
#####
Only candidate who focuses on real problems. I.e, Trump is a symptom of the disease, not the cause.
#####
Andrew Yang just hit the 2M dollar campaign donation goal for November 30 right on the dot! 
    1.5M dollars of the amount were generated in the last two days with people donating as little as a dollar. Amazing! 
       Yang's ideas and policies are now beginning to resonate all across the Country!
#####
Wow cool coverage of a candidate. Really deep and interesting. Thanks c b s!
#####
He doesn't oppose the 4th industrial revolution.  He acknowledges it.  Capitalism that begins with the people is THE ONLY real solution that has ever been presented to us.
#####
Yang 2020 OH YEAH ! Bring it ‚ù§Ô∏è Please don‚Äôt limit Andrew as ‚Äúthe tech guy‚Äù  - As a parent - and I‚Äôm getting older in the work force  - I completely connected to his message ! We need a new ‚Äú operating system ‚Äú everyone knows that inside
#####
Yang is my candidate.
#####
I'm not a us citizen yet, I'm a green card holder for 39 years and never apply for citizenship,  I am trying g my hardest to get accepted right  now so I can vote for him in November...but I do support him 100percent..I try to talk to everyone  I can about Andrew yang...pple that never register to vote like my mom and siblings, my gf and her family

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
Remember, to vote for Yang, you need to sign up as a Democrat. I'm a Republican, and switched recently, just so I can vote for him. I can ALWAYS switch back. Donate to Yang2020.com
#####
Goofy that all of this even needs to be said. Just shows how Yang has been mischaracterized by the media. The dude made a small amount of money and then dedicated his life to improving the lives of others. He's towards the bottom of the richest democratic candidates running. After, mind you, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
#####
One word : solution. Now don't stretch it, CBSN.
#####
Choose now. A future like Star Trek, or Mad Max.
#####
Read his book The War on Normal People. Or watch the HBO special on the Future of Work. Or FRONTLINE episode on Artificial intelligence. These clearly explain why we have to move quickly.
#####
There's nothing difficult to understand here. If u ever take macro-econ or keep your eyes open on the latest advances of mechatronic,  u have no choice but realize he's the candidate of future.
#####
was also Obama's ambassador of entrepreneurship
#####
Makes sense
#####
Ever since Yang started talking at all I instinctively saw he was a corporate Trojan Horse Gig Economy, anti-progressive.
#####
What good is healthcare when a doctor refuses to believe you have Tapeworm unless you have visited a third world country ?
#####
I liked Yang until I found out he had bewn lying about Medicare for all the whole time.
#####
this is a load. he is lying by using "medicare for all". the best case scenario he is proposing is a "medicare public option". health insurance companies make money by denying coverage. the only way medicare can compete with them is by also denying coverage. this is completely pointless basically making the whole plan a scam to keep health insurance companies chugging along and making more money. understand that health insurance companies are fancy products that basically do the accounting and pockets billions in profits by denying coverage. they DO NOT provide healthcare. health insurance companies are completely unnecessary. US govt will provide the insurance through medicare for all. just like all big companies, medicare will have a magnitude higher bargaining power in the world because they will be bargaining on behalf of 300 million americans and get the best prices on drugs. as usual nbc covering his lies. "more access" but not more coverage. more insurance plans in the market plans doesn't mean you get better coverage. medicare for all will have better coverage with lower cost. this is a blatant corporate talking point. please pay attention to what they are not saying.
#####
He calls it Medicare for all but it‚Äôs not, just lying to get votes, his plan isn‚Äôt really all that bad imho just wish he had more integrity like Sanders. Also, the ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù option (which is just Obamacare 2.0) isn‚Äôt much of a solution either, we will just end up with a slightly different way to pay a lot of money for healthcare because demand is inelastic and people will STILL go bankrupt from medical bills. He‚Äôs not the worst, just too little too late and of course better than the current potus
#####
Can anyone explain how a independent private doctor would get a salary?
#####
His health care idea is abysmal. The actual solution to health care is a single payer universal system. This... "Public option" concept has been tried in other countries and has failed massively due to the fact that the private health insurance companies refer as many sick people to the public health care system as possible while taking in as many healthy people as possible, which reduces the homoscedasticity of the populous causing increased costs per capita and wait times within the public system.
#####
go yang go
#####
Andrew Yang is a true problem solver.   If the problem is needing more money in your pocket then put it in our hands not some trickle down crap.
#####
Yang Gang ! let‚Äôs have it
#####
Yang looks at the root causes of the problem. I like that.
#####
He had hardly any name recognition to now beating career politicians. If he pulls this off and becomes president, i believe he will make true to most all of his campaign promises.
#####
#yang2020 #blackwomenforyang
#####
Yang is just like OBAMA who keep deceiving US and themselves also. They talk a lot of nonsense plans that will never work. For examples, all Obama's plans fail miserably up to now especially his Obama care. When he was President he can't hardly accomplished his plans successfully. He kept blaming others of his failures because of his incompetent and lack of technical skills as President. He keep spending and did not get any results as he promises. I sincerely believe Yang will follows the same path as Obama and definitely will screw up more where Obama left off.
#####
Yang is rad.
#####
Yang is right. There‚Äôs enough money in health care to give Americans the best health care in the world.  Just have to redesign the rules to serve the people.
#####
I support universal medical system. "Free market system" with many small insurance companies failed to provide basic consumer protection and must be reformed and transformed into single payer system with free market. Well known problem in many medical plans: pre-existing conditions denial, don't cover basic/essential health problems, bankruptcy of people/families who even had medical insurance, problems with payment for out of network providers in emergencies, huge/unreasonable deductibles, fine prints in contact, very low annual limit, service denial, etc. Add to above the highest prices in the world we are paying for services and medications.
#####
Majority of Canadian, Australians, Britons, Israelis and many other developed countries are satisfied with their health care system, but the majority of Americans are not satisfied with the healthcare system.
#####
It cost employers about 5$ an hour/employee to provide health insurance.  A progressive tax could pay for the universal health care and the 5$ could be put on workers checks.
#####

#####
This is the only time I'm really proud of the Asian stereotype of being good in math and Mr. Yang is slaying this statistics game. Please vote for him, dear Americans. He can solve your scary math problems. He can lead the world into an elevated existence ‚ú® he can usher our generation to finally live more dignified lives.
#####

#####
If I see a Yang video, I watch it.
#####
A public option that allows insurance company's to pick the healthiest individuals.
But the public option bit is forced to take the sickest which drives up the cost.

IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Salaries for doctors?? I'm no doctor, but that's stupid, socialized medicine that removes or reduces doctor give-a-shit. That won't end well for patients.
The SOLUTION is a single payer payroll tax FUND for hospital bills, and cash or private insurance for the rest, WITH a standardized, progressive out of pocket yearly maximum for every household. THIS IS THE SOLUTION.
AND, 22 million illegals start paying their fair share instead of clogging emergency rooms.
This SOLUTION saves $30 billion dollars right out of the gate.
Americans are turkey-stuffed goofy stupid.

So why is MSNBC silencing him? He makes so much sense!
Is it just racism? I'm confused.

Yang lost me with his, "I'll give you $100". If you have Blue Cross Blue Shield. They tell the doctors or hospital what they will pay. If you have medicare it will will tell the doctor what it will pay. When I had Blue Cross Blue Shield they told me if the doctors try to bill you more tell us.
The model has been set all we have to do is implement it. Yang is not good for being a leader of the country.

Yang is the only one focusing on addressing the root problems of the healthcare system. Single payer would eliminate competition but history proves monopoly is never the best for the people whether the service is provided by government or cooperations. Think DMV and PG&E. Yang‚Äôs on the right track to create an efficient system to make healthcare accessible, available and affordable to everyone without sacrificing quality, which is enhanced by competition.

Don't forget people Andrew Yang is a Non-profit entrepreneur. he was never going to sell anything for billions of dollars like all of the for-profit Entrepreneurs because be never made anything worth billions of dollars to somebody but what he did make is billions of dollars into your communities with his non-profit work. His net worth is around 2-3 million USD which after 15 years of work puts him in the upper middle class position at best. he is like us not a guy with endless supply of money to not worry about anything.

Bernie: ‚ÄúPeople are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. Vote for me, and i‚Äôll tax 60%+ of your income, and then provide you with a government job, House, healthcare, food, and college.‚Äù

Andrew Yang: ‚ÄúI believe you know what‚Äôs best for your own life. You‚Äôre competent enough to improve your situation if the resources and tools are readily available to  you.. and I believe the freedom to make decisions is important to become smarter and stronger. Instead of taxing everyday American‚Äôs annual income, i‚Äôm going to implement a transactional tax that falls less heavily on consumer stables and more heavily on luxury goods and services. Instead of using that money to fund the military industrial complex, i‚Äôm Going to Inject that money directly into our families and communities in the form of a dividend. This will spark consumer activity nationwide, especially in rural communities where opportunity is hard to come by. This will recognize the work of artists, stay at home parents, caregivers and volunteers. This will help minorities start businesses, and help give women leverage to escape a bad relationship or take care of her children. We are the most wealthy and advanced economy in the world holding the number 1 spot at 21 trillion GDP. It‚Äôs not a matter if we can afford it. We can. It‚Äôs my job to change this mindset of scarcity that America has been conditioned to believe, to a mindset of abundance. We must rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work for us, to protect us from the ever increasing invasive ness of artificial intelligence and automation. It‚Äôs not left, it‚Äôs not right, it‚Äôs forward. That‚Äôs where I plan on taking this country, America.‚Äù
#####
Many prominent economists, politicians, and visionaries have talked about UBI but no one has been able to propose an acceptable way to fund it. Yang's bold proposal of VAT-funded UBI and Human Centered Capitalism will transform the nation, and he should get nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in economics. Let's work on that!
#####
#Yang2020
#####
Democrats think the Nordic countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are countries America should emulate.. I agree, and that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm voting for Yang and not Bernie. These countries continue to grow their nuclear energy capacity because of it‚Äôs efficiency and success, they have a private insurance market on top of their universal health care system, and they don‚Äôt have a wealth tax but instead a VAT because a wealth tax has proven to be a failure. Bernie obviously can‚Äôt learn from these country‚Äôs past mistakes. He‚Äôs stuck in the 20th century. I can‚Äôt blame him.. he‚Äôs old and stubborn. Andrew Yang however, is the 21st century candidate we need.

Definitely not appropriate to force your interviewee to donate and it's not like Yang is rich as well. Some of you maybe even make more money than he does as he has been doing a Non profit for the last 7 years helping America and now in a greatest effort for all Americans.
#####
I rock with this guy...signed up on his website!! now let's get it
#####
President Yang!!!

To anyone against UBI, if you think letting Zuckerberg, Bezos and other tech giants hold on to trillions of dollars each year will somehow trickle down to us, then you've lost connection with how the current economy works. Mark and Jeff aren't creating new jobs with those trillions. They are investing in new ways to automate away even more of the jobs that still exist.

The advancement of technology has been killing and will continue to kill the trickle down economy. Trickle down is already over at the highest levels of the economy and it is never returning at those levels due to automation and other technologies. As technology becomes more sophisticated, trickle down will stop working at lower and lower levels of the economy. Trickle down will only work at the very lowest levels (mom and pop, vocational, etc.) in the future. UBI is the only way for humanity to benefit off of technology going forward. You have to come to terms with the fact that technology can already do our work as well as we can in many cases and will only get better at it over time. There is literally no issue with letting everyone benefit off of technology. No one is getting hurt by it unless you think data servers, software, computer chips and robots have feelings.

Never listen to an Economist about the economy.....they're always wrong!!!

Whether you are voting for him or not, you can see that Andrew Yang has found a healthy, grounded, wholesome part of his personality to live in and live by.  He has a new perception of community for America.  The only way to change the world is to change yourself and Andrew Yang is using his personality to serve his greater calling.  We are each vehicles of Global Transformation.  I‚Äôm so inspired to know that someone like Andrew Yang has stepped forward, he‚Äôs going to change America and will be the marker for others to step forward (there are more like him) but not running for President!!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this, is the beginning of a Better Future for Mankind!

Funny "to put it into perspective" they use the gross individual US income tax figure. Wow, this is precisely the issue: Missing federal income tax funds from our top 60 companies. Lol
#####
Apparently, Andrew is the best candidate for the people! Sometimes I have the illusion that he's from the future and travels to this world to save Earth. ;-)
#####
Yang isn't "off color" though. He simply talks to his audience. A bunch of young people likely won't mind if Yang drops a few F-bombs. Yang is always professional with a more formal audience. I would rather hear truthful statements with F-bombs, that phony politician bullshit without any "off color" words. "Bullshit" is the most off color word to me and Yang never uses the concept of that word. Most politicians use it constantly.

#####
Hi I‚Äôm sorry but this video is a little misleading. 

The VAT can be tailored to luxury goods. So staple goods like diapers tooth paste. 
And the VAT is a portion of how how will pay for it
#####
If u set up a stupid tax system when multiple trillion company like google, apple, Boeing pay 0 tax and billionaire pay less than a plumper, then u properly don't have enough $ to fund anything.
#####
UBI plus VAT= Star Trek future. Otherwise it‚Äôs MAD MAX.
#####
1000 k a month sounds like he wants to buy our votes with our own money.
#####
Who's math is correct though? What kind of percentage would be needed
#####
Andrew has to win.  He is the only person smart enough to bet Trump. üòéüòé
#####
The most important thing to do is get out and vote for him in the Primaries and Caucuses
Just Google this: nytimes. com 2020-presidential-election-calendar
If he is the party nominee, he will win the General Election
#####
When anyone that made a YouTube video could get a slice ad revenue CPM crashed and most people made pennies on the dollar. YouTube had to switch back to the old Partner Program system to save it's self and so Content creators could make a decent wage and not close to none. Companies have a right to split their ad revenue between the people in the company. Not Fair if you are forced to split your hard earned revenue with losers that didn't work for it especially if you have worked for years to build passive income systems online to benefit you after making nothing for the first 3 years.
#####
It's a good video as it looks more like reporting than an advertisement. However, even in this video, it's the math that seems to be a bit of a sticky point. If he has actually done the math, perhaps he wouldn't mind sharing his calculations? Current US population is 327mln (source: wiki), multiplied by 12 (months) and by 1000 (dollar) =  3,924,000,000,000. That's almost 4 trillion. It's a very rough estimate, the actual number might be 2 to 3 trillion, considering that this money will be only paid to adults of a certain age. Entire revenues of the federal budget were (source: wiki, please verify) were 3.3. trillion, which is just about the amount of money that you would need for the UBI alone. So, if you don't want to cut out anything (arguably it may be hard to make cuts from this very conservative budget - and - actually the country spent 800bln more than it brought in revenues in 2018), you basically need to add 100% of revenue. I think that a solution might be to actually marry Sanders' concept of taxing the top 1% with the idea of UBI. Let's say you want to do it through VAT but without affecting prices of goods the common people would like to still be able to buy. So, you tax all the luxury items, luxury property, etc. You tax them a lot, maybe even 100%. 
Do you know that reach people can actually choose where they want to live? I mean: which country they want to live in and pay their taxes to. Check, for instance, Gerard Depardieu, the icon of French cinema. So, what can it lead to? The exodus of millionaires. If they value their money, they will also be much more likely to buy their luxury items abroad rather pay double in their home country. Who are you going to tax then?
So, what if you can't get this money through the taxes on luxury goods because the sell of highly taxed luxury goods goes down the hill?
I am really surprised that nobody is actually trying to work out and discuss these things in public. 
At least this mad spending idea places Bernie as a more moderate thinker and gives him a better chance to be elected. He just wants to introduce social security the way if has functioned in many countries since ww2. 
I like the idea of UBI but the math doesn't seem to check out at all. 
Is America ready to elect another president who offers a pie-in-the-sky solution and fails to show the numbers?
#####
I just saw his real attitude! Just decided to donate to his campaign! A Yanger Banger!‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
#####
All people probably already know this, but it‚Äôs always good to make sure that everyone knows:

Many of us will benefit from the 1k/mo because it will be extra money that we spend and thereby all businesses will see more shoppers and thereby they can hire more people etc etc. and that‚Äôs wonderful. 

However, roughly half of the united states population is receiving some form of government aid. There is a noteworthy percentage of american people on food stamps. These people will have to give up any government aid they are receiving, in order to ‚Äúopt in‚Äù to that $1k/mo. So they will be given cash (if they opt in) and told to go to the private sector. Not sure if all government dependents out there know that. I wonder how many of them believe that they are getting 1k extra per month, on top of government benefits. I wonder how many of them will vote for Yang, purely due to their misunderstanding. I wonder if there‚Äôs some way that we all can make this very clear to the low or no income inner city government dependent person so that they make an informed decision.
#####
Andrew Yang just has that one elusive quality that all politicians wish they had:  He's INSPIRING.  Listening to him speak, you feel optimistic, hopeful, and empowered - not just for yourself, but for the entire nation.  Traditional non-voters are going to pour out in droves to support this man.
#####
Everyone said Trump's odds of winning were overwhelming too. Yet, here we are.
#####
Trickle Up Economy! Who would have thunk!
The fact that all these companies didn't pay taxes for the last 10 years is enough justification for UBI! You can view UBI in many different ways 
1. Justice Money for companies not paying  taxes.
2. Justice Money for Companies only trickling down only 6% of their tax cut benefits ( they put the rest into stock buy backs) and increasing the federal defecit.
3. Would we rather have the money  go to the Cash Burning Lazy Politicians or directly to the people so they can start a business?
4. Stay at home mom gets rewarded for her hard work in nurturing, loving and raising child so the child can thrive in school.
5. Gets people out of welfare
6. Incentives for people to stay out of jail!
#####
4:40 - Someone from the Yang team should clarify, but I believer there are other aspects of Andrew's plan to pay for the Freedom Dividend than just the VAT. Having it replace most welfare programs is one. I believe Yang also supports returning the estate tax to the Obama rate. He may also support returning the tax structure to something similar to where it was during Obama's presidency. I bring these up because the national debt ballooned under Trump (deficit was $438b in 2015 under Obama, and estimated to be over $1b by the time 2019 is over, and rising). 

Another angle not mentioned, but should be roundly discussed, is that for the last 30 years the Republicans, and many Democrats, have favored some form of Monetarism, or supply-side economics to grow the economy, and tied it to austerity. In plain english: Cutting taxes for mostly the wealthy and corporations, and cutting spending. The pitch says that this will create jobs, eventually those jobs will pay more, and this will grow the economy, thus lowering the deficit, and debt. But outside of a few years in the mid-80's, this has hardly happened. In fact, wages are flat, and the labor participation rate (how many able bodied people actually working) in the US is about the same as many third world countries. Yang's FD reverses this concept, saying if you put the money in people's hands instead of CEO's and corporations, they'll spend it, which will grow the economy very quickly. Since supply-side economics tied to austerity has been a slow rotting failure for the bottom 90%, and a very expensive one, why not at least try a UBI, try the Freedom Dividend. If it turns out it fails, we can reverse it.
#####
Andrew Yang is the one !
#####
I like nerds, will vote for him
#####
He seems to be the the  honest and forward guy. Not fot polictical party, but for the people. I'll vote for him.
#####
CBS, screw you, your bias is obvious against him, do better.
#####
"Its less than half of what the front runners took in". Shows Biden's 15 million. I guess he isnt a front runner any more!
#####
Love him but the big tech won‚Äôt let you win bruh
#####
I believe on him he will transform the america.
#####
If yang is elected, expect a market crash shortly thereafter
#####
I love this man more and more!
#####
So far I think he is the most straight forward candidate. Just look at the answer on corruption between Yang vs Elizabeth Warrren.
#####
there is a reason his face is everywhere and there is a reason some people try and hide this man like hes not taking this country by storm so theres a reason I will vote for him he just makes way to much sense
#####
For those of us that are already familiar with Andrew yang we know who he is.  For me this clip makes me rock with him that much harder.  But for those that don‚Äôt know who he is I‚Äôm not sure this was the best first impression.

To the whitehouse. Love Andrew Yang

Yang 2020

This. I like this. Sunday Morning + Yang man
#####
Andrew Yang will be the next president. I see now that all the polls are flawed, the news disproportionately  excludes, downplays and sometimes simply omits Andrew entirely. This is the first politician i have and ever will donate to, and yet the media downplays just how powerful this campaign is. If it got me exited, i doubt it dosnt excite anyone else who might look at his message and solutions. I urge you all to go to his website yang2020 and try to argue how his proposals would do anything less than move us all towards a better future.
#####
Look at the negative or rather sarcastic message in this video, but then look at all the great and positive comments.
#####
Gimme some Yang!
#####
Instead of interviewing the people against the freedom dividen seporately, they need to have them debate yang directly. Itll make a world of difference
#####
Human centered capitalism is the same sad socialism snake oil.

So is humanity first banner. It used to be ‚Äúworkers of the world, unite!‚Äù

They have just got a new salesman. His name is Andrew Yang. He‚Äôll be peddling the snake oil till end of time.
#####
Watching the debates from Australia.

Andrew Yang is spreading a message that needs to be heard and heeded across the globe.

The system is too far corrupted for him to win üò©

2:02 Jobs [...] the loss of them, are -like- why Donald Trump won the presidency.
#####
America needs to switch to the metric system. The U.S.A. is one of three countries that still uses imperial system. Time to join the rest of the world USA
#####
Biggest argument against Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend = "I don't know how that would work", aka: "I will ignore any working examples of UBI and pretend like it's just silly, even if I look like an idiot. I'm just hoping to convince other short sighted people it's a bad idea because the huge wealth gap is good for the rich."
#####
Obama's (or any President of the last three decades (at least) economic advisors should not be held up as the authority on economics. Yang's whole point as an outsider numbers guy, entrepreneur, job creator and "Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship", is that our capitalism has gone off the rails and these "experts" are either ignorant or willfully letting it happen for their own administration or self gain. It certainly appears to be the latter.
#####
Yang needs to stop cursing. I don‚Äôt care but the media will
#####
Yang‚Äôs message resonates with all camps due to his sincerity and relatability on hot bottom issues like for instance, the decline of dynamism within the incomes of everyday American households. 

The only way other candidates could measure up is if they allowed their message to be as clear and concise as Yang‚Äôs.  

Politicians of the 21st century still sound like Politicians of the 20th century and therein lies the problem. 

Leading this country requires a visionary who understand the plethora of ramifications that arise from a peak in the technological sector. 

Yang‚Äôs the right visionary for the Oval full stop.

#####
Thanks goodness I didn‚Äôt vote for Obama.  The economic advisor is a status quo bullshieter.  2.4 trillion is a lot of money so we just write off the idea and go back to social programs as handouts for the poor and give tax cut as handouts for the rich? 1) VAT 10% 2) make defense spending a hard number with annual increase of 3%.  $300B to kick off the starting year.  3) close all corporate tax loopholes to make the effective tax rate as less than 10% of the corporate tax rate.  4) tax worldwide corporate profits.  It‚Äôs bullshiet that an expat pay tax on earning worldwide but corporate can shield off foreign profits.  5) increase inheritance tax and estate tax of over $50M 6) consolidate all current social programs with an opt in for UBI 
There are so many more ways to get to 2.4 trillion and once the program is implemented the trickle up will work.  It is certainly worth a try because it makes more sense than trickle down voodoo bullshiet.
#####
A new humanity is born! Rejoice now. Think and act as if it is already done.

Entire industries that carry the majority of american jobs are being lost to automation and robotics not in 10 years, 5 years, but 2 years on average. None of these jobs are coming back. Pensions, retirement, benefits, stocks a worker payed for will continue to go unfullfulled, never rewarded, a total loss with the loss of even a tenured job. Having too much faith in corporations as the sole means for humans to acquire wealth and security is no longer an option. We need a new means of thriving or we are all toast.
#####
Everybody is praising how smart he is and how he's got all the data...can we just recognize how hard-working this guy is!?!!?  Imagine having to answer all the tough questions with REAL answers!

Share Yang's videos on forums, with your friends and family share with everyone. People will come to their senses and realize how great he is, and that they're also tired of fake politicians with no regard for the people.
#####
Brainy head of state does not matter.  Can he talk street language that ordinary people can understand?  Is he a normal human with human emotions: happy, puzzled, excited, disappointed, funny, serious, etc?
Please ... No more robotic politicians.  The old pollies are not human.  They are fake puppets.  We want real people.

If I was an American and I was able to vote.  I would vote for him.  Real talk!

I tried to read as far down in the comments, and i can't even find one soul complaining or having a negative thought about this guy! Wow! If America can't see what's set before it, then i would know for sure, America is the dumbest country in the world! You can put Yang against anyone, and without doubt he should win, unless the voters have lost their minds.
#####
If the DNC can get out of their own arrogant way (which clearly and predictably did not work in their favor in 2016) and Yang can win the nomination, he will EASILY win 2020. This is the sentiment from sides.

Freedom Dividend ( $1000/month for all adults ) is a right solution for the massive job loss due to automation.
Once adopted in USA, this will be adopted by other nations as well. And this will change the human history as a whole.

Trump: hello, Putin?
#####
WTF?  Europe, China, Japan, and people paying attention in America has been discussing the 4th industrial revolution since 2016???   Why is Yang the only candidate who knows about it in American politics?  Why does CNN think this is a new concept Yang invented???  Just how out of touch with reality are these MSM and politicians???  To think countries like Germany, Japan, China, Finland are already way ahead in this and CNN just heard it for the first time...  Is CNN based in North Korea or what?

Very very big to hammer BTC.....Keep close watch

He needs to get tougher and extra security for his food and windows

You can‚Äôt fool Yang

Um, Yang personally did not name it "The 4th Industrial Revolution", yo! Jesus Christ, how behind are you, CNN?!?!?!

Yang will lose the nominee because libtards never learn from history

I don't understand why people like Yang so much
He's a follower of Milton Freeman.
Free-market  libertarianism has been a disaster wherever it's implemented.

If you dems don‚Äôt get this guy as your candidate, you‚Äôre losing 2020 by a landslide

Def the smartest candidate we had in a long time.

I support Yang because it feels as though Im fighting for the underdog( the people that cant or wont show his ideas support). He wins and it will be a win for them too and some them would not even know that type of huge win was coming. Thank you Andrew Yang2020

He's the right man but America is going to screw up and vote Trump because there to angry about the past and future .

I‚Äôm excited at the prospect of a Yang Presidency.

Yang is the only one up there that I actually think is genuine about what he says.  Of course everyone should form their own opinions about these candidates but I ask people to not look at the party people associate with but what policies and differences they bring to the table.  Remember to be polite and fair to each other #yanggang #yang2020

The President has agreed to a medically correct procedure. A brain will be inserted into his skull. ooh boy. i hope this works.

UBI could be better than the current welfare system as long as its completely scrapped, along with the complete elimination of the minimum wage. But automation is not the problem.  Government labor laws, taxes, and regulations are killing jobs. Automation is mitigating the damage.
#####
"The studies I've seen say the exact opposite." NOT JUST THE ONE'S YOU'VE SEEN ANDREW. THE CONSENSUS IS CLEAR AND IF WARREN CAN'T SEE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIOECONOMIC TREND TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM OUR WAY OF LIFE, SHE'S NOT FIT TO BE IN OFFICE
#####
Andrew Yang. Big fan of this man
#####
this taiwanese descendant not becoming president more like a governor
#####
Gosh he‚Äôs a genius! Best candidate of all time let‚Äôs not blow this!
#####
Truth is, if you actually listen to Andrew Yang all other candidates seem outdated.
#####
I love how is thinking about both sides and is not against the opposition.
#####
Americunts are a bunch of racists , Andrew Yang got no chance , and US does not deserve.
#####
You think you have an argument against Yang but you don‚Äôt you really don‚Äôt. Just common sense shit with authenticity. You can not beat that. And another word, ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù
#####
Ladies and gentlemen you are witnessing a communist Coup of the most transparent presidency since JFK. Dont believe the lies cnn. Msnbc, NEW YORK TIMES  tell you. WAKE UP! Trump2020 üá∫üá∏ FREEEDOM!!!
#####
Whoever said to tax the
rich is stupid. It is like flogging a dead horse. Trump does not pay any taxes,
cannot even get to see his tax return. Amazon do not pay any taxes. VAT is the
way to go. With UBI trickling up, VAT is actually trickling down.
#####
If you want socialism vote for Andrew Yang.
#####
Lol this guy will destroy usa
#####
Yang has really caught my attention. He's the only one I've seen so far that is truly speaking up about Universal Basic Income, which we WILL NEED if we continue to evolve more into automation. I hope the DNC doesn't squash him out like they did with Bernie in the last election
#####
Even if he doesn't win, I hope he finds a place in the White House to help. We need him
#####
the only candidate speaks by facts and based on study compare to other candidates which speaks based on assumption and opinion.
#####
Go and donate to yang. Even a dollar counts and they count number of donors.
#####
If Yang does not win, he NEEDS to get on the VP ticket with Warren or Bernie. Maybe even moreso with Warren. He can be a great influence with them and even make their own policies more palatable to GOP Congress.
#####
in a parallel Universe the American people is smart enough to deserve him as president
#####
Yaaaaaang üí™üèªüí™üèª

This free everything argument is horseshit. The wealthy are the ones benefiting from handouts.  We live in Bizarro world, a world where the wealthy and solely the wealthy are entitled to handouts, in the form of tax cuts (no taxes) and everyone else pays their way. 
Wake up people.  You're getting fucked and have been for years.
#####
Maybe Warren hasn't been to a GM factory, Walmart or package sorting facility..Or maybe automation kills her candidacy?
#####
A VAT tax is already applied to the supply chain in over 140 countries around the world, including Brazil  China, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, & the United Kingdom.

Yang and Gabbard would be an unbeatable ticket.  Tulsi would make up for his obvious deficiency in foreign policy experience and would appeal to female voters.  Trump wouldn't be able to beat Yang in a debate.  He already has the other democratic candidates wary of even challenging his ideas. 

Be smart and make this happen, America!
#####
Yang would kill Trump in a debate
#####
Super happy to see more people turning in and hearing about yang! Can‚Äôt wait for him to be our future president
#####
At this point, anyone still going for Warren or Biden is a sheep
#####
It like pulling on a yin yang  every time this guy talks
#####
Andrew Yang is Amazing. Screw all the other democratic candidates.
#####
As an Australian looking from an outside perspective, this man seems to be the most sensible democrat candidate. Do not screw this up America.
#####
Yang knows what he is doing. Let‚Äôs get this man in office!
#####
It‚Äôll be my first time voting. Parents very conservative. Would consider myself in the middle leaning conservative but think that voting for just one party no matter what is kind of stupid. Yang seems to be the best option in my opinion
#####
I Yang to strangers.
#####
All other candidate is always "trump trump trump". Andrew yang knows trump needs to be out of office but he is focus on the people not trump.
#####
Yang for president!
#####
So Yang does have a weakness. It's his weak approach to healthcare. Obama forced uninsured americans who couldn't afford healthcare to pay for crappy insurance or pay a fine at the end of the year for having no insurance. Yang sounds like that's similar to what he wants to do. Bernie Sanders has a better plan though I love Andrew Yang's other policies.
#####
i think having a co-pay so you have "some skin in the game" is a good thing, however I have patients who make decent money, but have larger families, support their parents and in-laws, and are really tight on funds. having a $25 - $45 co-pay for many may not seem like a big deal, but to some it is a wall between seeking treatment and not seeking treatment.  I would suggest the co-pay to be low enough that this will never be an issue, but high enough so that people don't go because they are bored, or have nothing better to do, maybe $5 comes to mind. 

Also, the problem with current medi-care is that the fee schedules are not realistic. It seems it is made out so that a private practice doctor cannot keep their doors open just taking medi-care rates (not managed medi-care, the true flat federal government rate). 

Now I get why the federal government would make it low, because doctors have other sources of income other than medi-care or medicaid patients. however once a medi-care for all system, or even a public option is available. unless the fee schedule is competative with for profit insurance companies, there is absolutely no way people will have "high quality care" when the doctor who is seeing them is basically doing it for charity.

thats not to say for profit insurances are saints, most of them do sneaky things to deny coverage, and partner with dodge 3rd party companies to lower pay-out to providers, often times to match the medi-care rate. 

it would be better to calculate a reasonable workload for a doctor, expected traffic in and out the office, and calculate a fee schedule that is appropriate, for example lets say your local doctor's office has 50k/year expenses due to rent, equipment utilities etc. and each doctor there works 40 hours a week, it is reasonable that he should make between 120 - 300k/year given his education. the receptionist should also make between 25 - 50k/year. this means maybe 300k for 40 hour work week for a year is reasonable. lets say the doctor seeks 8 patients per day, leaving room for paper work, and non-filled appointment slots and no-shows. this means a reasonable rate is $156/patient.
#####
Yang is pulling back on healthcare - why? He used to be M4A, then went for Public option, and after reading his recent plan in his website I don‚Äôt see how I will get healthcare. I don‚Äôt have healthcare. I can‚Äôt afford it. I am self employed. How would I get healthcare under Yang‚Äôs plan which are a complex set of ideas for reducing costs by pleading to those who control the industry.  This is one place where I think Yang isn‚Äôt making a sincere, big difference.
#####
One of the few Dem frontrunner who isn't a pure idealogue.  We need someone with logic, brains and compassion in the WH.  Yang is the only candidate with all three of those qualities IMO.  He's a longshot, but the alternatives are way worse.  Don't agree with him on UBI, but all his other ideas seem sound and pragmatic.  UBI is very unlikely to ever get anywhere on Congress so hopefully his supporters aren't single issue voters.
#####
why squeeze the private companies over time when you can do it right away with single payer?
#####
Chris Hayes saying Hi before an interview is a common courtesy #msbc #yang2020
#####
guys ...I'm a Canadian and now live in the states ...Medicare for all aka universal basic healthcare or whatever you wanna call it (it's freaking semantics ) doesn't necessarily cover everything ...that's why Canada still has private health insurance. ..particularly to cover dental ..vision ..physio ...and prescription drugs..

yang is letting private insurance stay there...if people realize the public option is better...they'll stop paying for private ...whether this happens depends how good the coverage is in terms of the public option but based on what I see from other countries ...the private sector needs to play a role as the govt can't cover everything ..even if it does in theory ..there will be limits to the coverage

Canada's prescription drug costs are second highest in the world (US is obviously first )...there's been discussion for a national pharmacare program but the govt is afraid it'll cost too much (one estimate is 15 billion for Canada's small population )...scale that to the US and add in the stronger resistance from big pharma in the US .....
#####
Bad look, Chris.  Bias showing.  Disappointing.
#####
So he doesn't believe in m4a
#####
I want to see these yang haters when yang actually becomes president but ik it would be unlikey.... it would still be nice to see these closeminded people crawling back to yang UBI ..... cause even when ppl criticise him about the UBI, Free money no strings attached is a thing everyone wants.....and u would be stupid if you actually don't get it.....

Yang just had an actual GOOD interview on MSNBC!! Moments ago! Can't wait for them to upload it.
#####
None of you YangGangers are even talking about the laughable garbage that spewed out of Yangs mouth in this interview. He does not support Medicare for all based on his actual website but using the terminology to win voters. It's incredibly disingenuous and gross.
#####
I love Andrew Yang!
#####
Cant beleive the litle time given to Andrew Yang in MSNBC.  Saaaaadddd.
#####
The only reason this issue would ever be brought up again is that you have no other legitimate grievance on ANDREW YANGS platform to bring up. He has answered every question during his 14 hour marathon questioning, he spent an awfully amount of time on this issue alone.
#####
Cris, this issue has been answered during your media blackout. You member. This was fully explained by ANDREW YANG, member? You member. Autonomy and independent journalism is as American as apple pie. Get your boot off of our throats and put the money in our hands.
#####
A male news-anchor with his black eye liner running. Thats funny!

This guy is a terrible speaker. Has no idea what he's talking about regarding healthcare. Drop out now.

‚Äúthe spirit of medicare for all‚Äù is lip service, and meaningless. No better than what Pete Buttigieg is proposing. It‚Äôs sad. I guess he doesn‚Äôt want the liberal vote.

#####
Bernie's medical for all will throw 2 million people off their jobs.https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/12/28/bernie-sanders-says-medicare-for-all-will-cost-jobs/  Bernie's plan to address the job loss is to have federal jobs retraining program and a federal jobs guarantee lol.  if you are a yang supporter.. you will just shake your head. There is no way the government can retrain 2 million people to get new careers. And additionally the government is terrible at running real businesses.. Healthcare.gov crashed within hours upon launch and had to be rebuilt by silicon valley. Obama had to throw out a bunch of red tape just so the specialist can come in and fix it.. And this is just a website. I don't trust bernie's plan to address the massive job losses that will come with his Medicare 4 all plan.

#####
MSNBC is a joke, plain and simple.
#####
So disappointed in Yang. Please America, do not fall for this bait-and-switch. Yang is not for M4A. He is not for single payer. He supports private insurance, which is why your healthcare is so expensive. Keeping private insurance will push the sick onto the public plan, reduce bargaining power for the government to lower drug prices, and by and large, keep things the way that they are.
#####
Andrew Yang Doesn't Support Medicare4All #Facts Check His Plan

Honestly, the far left liberal media and personnel that smeared Andrew should be ashamed of themselves. I respect Bernie's plan that's trying to bring healthcare for all. But I also like Andrew's that try to achieve a similar goal in a different way and frankly, his plan is a lot more realistic to pass the Congress. If they don't like it, don't vote for him. There's no need to smear.  But it seems to me these attackers have a hidden agenda.

Sad to see the flip-flopping by Yang.  He is not for medicare-for-all like he stated before!!!  Just sad!!!
#####
yang is real deal
#####
So it's not Medicare for all..
#####
Yang 2020. Time to upgrade our economy.
#####
I really like Yang, but I do think he needs to make a clearer stance on health care.  While I think MSNBC has been absolutely shameful in their coverage of Yang, the health care questions from Chris Hayes seem valid to me.
#####
so were done with Yang, right?
#####
andrew is lying. he is not for medicare for all. he is supposed to be a decent man with honest plans. this is such a blatant lie. he can say medicare public option and ubi instead of lying to people by saying medicare for all
#####
Yang is lying. He has no public option.

Everybody has to ask who's paying the bill, for EVERYTHING.

duh! in a good way

Truth is, Yang doesn't really have any coherent Policies and he has no relevant experience in Government whatsoever... If the three leading candidates all dropped dead he would still be odds on to get about 3 % of the vote...

Long story short...Yang wants medicare-for-some aka Medicare for those who want it. Not medicare for all single payer.
#####
He could've call it universal healthcare,  yang care , care for all, come on!! . Medicare for all was prop up by Bernie so alot of people are gonna think it's the same. That skin in the game will rig the public option to fail .

MSNBC is garbage.


they snubbed yang more than 14 times on live TV.

Seems like MSNBC asked Andrew Yang on the show, just so they could trip him up, but he's too smart for that. Also, there is nothing to criticize him about. Instead, Chris Hayes comes out looking misinformed and confused; obviously not doing his research. What is really underhanded is when they could not make Andrew look bad in the interview, they had to bring these two talking heads to try and smear Yang. MSNBC did not upload this part of the clip. One of the heads, some white haired old guy, said that he thought those people standing behind Yang were his only black supporters.  I bet he knows by now how stupid that sounds!
#####
Yang is pretty darn clear here:  Public option and going toward universal coverage but without the large scale disruptions proposed by Bernie's single-provider for all proposal.
#####
This why Yang is not a good candidate. He wants to are time for private insurance companies to undermine Medicare for all. They will offer plans that seem competitive while introducing complexities and prior authorization for covered medical procedures. The goal, of course will be too undermine M4A.
#####
If it's not m4a then just state it.  No bait and switch.
#####
With an extra $1000 a month maybe i could actually afford private insurance.
#####
He isn‚Äôt for Medicare for All. I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt like him anymore
#####
Shrimp fried rice and steamed dumplings please
#####
Just here for Yang.
#####
Regressive Yang!
#####
I wish Andrew Yang would simply call it "Single Payer Option with low deductibles and other cost reducing measures" to start out ... then,  if people are satisfied, they will start dropping (or reducing coverage) from their private plans.
#####
MSNBC SUCKS ONLY WATCH IF ANDREW YANG ON IT
#####
Chris you are confused because you are not smart enough and was paid to say so to mislead the audience, so audience are hearing confusion to Andrews policy, Andrews policy is loud and clear and you have to be very very dumb to not getting it!? It‚Äôs much more superior than other candidates plans!!!!!

The United States National Health Care Act or Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act is a bill¬†first¬†introduced in the United States House of Representatives by former Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 25 cosponsors.

#####
So media 1, Yang 0.

Well done Yang.  Who needs who now?
#####
MSNBC is utter trash.
#####
I feel bad for yang and bernie because they do not deserve to have a part of their fan base be so utterly obnoxious and hatefilled. Bernie would win if he would tell his nutters to act decent. Since he wont it reflects poorly on him. Same for yang who encourages it more than bernie.
#####
Makes sense to me
#####
Yang is correct about the response of some workers to the choice between benefits that they have spent years to obtain and government provided benefits, which may or may not be as good. I was exposed to this same problem when retirees were first offered Medicare in addition to their company retirement medical plan. The problem came when they were expected to pay additional amounts for Parts A & B. I had a lot of people asking me how they could get out of Medicare. Although I appreciate Yang's more flexible approach, I disagree with the concept of "skin in the game". Medical care delivered on a timely basis without regard to "saving up enough money to pay for the copay" on an MRI or an office visit is ultimately less expensive for the entire system. Diseases caught at an earlier stage of development can usually be handled more quickly and with less invasive methods. This National Health Care Plan is an issue that America should have addressed 50 years ago. Now that all of the other capitalist countries already have working plans, we can easily look and see what works for them. The Congress will ultimately design any plan that we end up with. Our new President can help to steer, but the details are worked out in Congress.

Andrew Yang is the best choice on the left. He is leaps and bounds better than Warren or Sanders. The UBI idea was proposed by conservative economists. I would consider Yang, you give me any of the others and I will vote Trump again. Yang doesn't need to win the left votes. Any canidate has them. He would win the moderate right and Independents thus the election. Trump will be easy to beat of you don't try to out crazy and go extreme left. A moderate wins.

If you think Yang has a chance of even being nominated, than you probably thought Bernie had a chance.

Andrew Yang rules. Please, say goodbye to the dinos next Nov.
#####
He is raising money, but as of yet his poll numbers are not moving. Time will tell, but I'm not holding my breath.  For now either warren or sanders have my support, but Yang could get it if his numbers get above 10% AND he supports universal healthcare and tuition free college (I have never looked him up, so he might support these). Would e nice supporting a candidate a little closer to my age rather than my grandparents.
#####
My only issue with him are his stance on gun laws, but the pros out weigh the cons in this for me, and one of the pros that outright negates the that con for me is the fact that with research presented and a proper argument I feel like his stance on guns could change with how progressive he is.

CBS always been my favorite channel. Maybe not as entertaining as Fox or NBC, but you always hear the truth, and when it comes to news, that's what I want.
#####
Thank you CBS!  #Yang2020 # HumanityFirst
#####
I‚Äôm going to vote for Andrew Yang. He knows the tech world we live in.
#####
I bet Trump secretly wants Yang to win. He hasnt said anything about him so far. I remember reading from an article online that Trump's campaign manager mentioned Yang's mediablackout. Trump may act stupid but I guess he knows whats going on.

Where's the yang gang at?

UBI is way down the list of issues that need to be addressed and the problems that need to be fixed. 1k a month helps, but it pales in comparison to universal healthcare, affordable medication, affordable higher education, decent wages, or even drinkable water. You gotta clean your house before you start decorating it
#####
Very good and respectful reporting on Yang by CBS!  And they got his name right.  Take note MSNBC.
#####
I want Yang to be my dad
#####
It will be a dream if we get an asian president
#####
Don‚Äôt want another businessman a President. Run for Senate!
#####
Tell your friends about Andrew Yang.
#####
Love his idea of the democracy dollar.
#####
Fake news
#####
Few questions, what‚Äôs going to happen with illegal immigrants that are going to come for this $1000 a month. Is the govt going to give them billions in handouts like the dems currently are? 
Also, he states that‚Äôs his tax base to fund the $1k per month will be coming from companies. Why would companies stay here if they‚Äôre going to be taxed like crazy then? Also, how would you fund that program if the overall economy enters a recession and the tax base isn‚Äôt where it needs to be from a tax income perspective? By printing more money, inflation?? What would happen to purchasing value of the dollar, considering housing prices, car prices, etc. will skyrocket due to the extra income and investment potential for them. I personally would buy a house with my extra $1k per month and rent it out for $1500. Now if everyone else starts doing this, then what did we really solve. Nothing....I would like to hear more than the cover story and I feel like Americans never look into the repercussions.....
#####
Andrew.....please don‚Äôt wear hats.
#####
Where are warrens numbers?!?!? Lol she‚Äôs probably washing money to add into the fundraiser.
#####
Fair coverage of Andrew Yang campaign.
#####
Real people are giving yang money while Corporations toss their millions in pocket change to the others.
#####
Now dont make this Chinese duude the president of the state's man ,ffs!
#####
I agreed with this guest, if Yang wants to move further ahead, he also need to address other issues to gain more voters support because UBI is not everyone's # 1 concerns especially the middle upper class.  Environmental concerns, job creation, health care and foreign policy are all good issues to address.  People want to hear his creative ideas.  As President he will need to work on all these issues, not just UBI.
#####
I would save that $1000 each month so I could retire early as so to give another one who needs it. This is called job movement in order provide more job opportunities.
#####
This doesn't need testing. It works 100%! My life will be better getting extra 1k a month.
#####
Really hurts my thumb, pressing like button on an NBC clip.
#####
This money will help us!!! stop trying to make it look impossible, but yet we can afford trillions for wars, and who ask us if it was ok to bail out banks with trillions $s. Yang 2020
#####
PLEASE HELP ME
#####
Yang should pick two small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Then project the impact of the Freedom Dividend on both towns.  The direct and indirect benefits to both towns.
#####
*Trust me the Democrats will stop this for sure as shüí©t stinks. They love to keep people oppress that why they didn't want him on stage.*
#####
#YangGang #Yang2020 this is great! Im a RN, 36 yrs, can only work 24 hrs a week max. I think it's a great idea!
#####
‚ÄúPlenty of other countries?‚Äù Literally every industrialized country has a VAT, except for the United States. Every. Single. One. And the average VAT in Europe is 20%, double that of the 10% we‚Äôd need to fund the Freedom Dividend. Furthermore, the money doesn‚Äôt go to government programs. It goes directly to the people, who have the freedom to spend it in any way they choose. There‚Äôs nothing more American than that.
#####
Most economists say vat is bad yet most countries have it and it helps fund their social programs for disadvantaged  people. Ok ‚Äúmost economists‚Äù
#####
YANG GANG 2020
#####
Yes! Everyone needs to be a winner this election season! Yang is for the people!
#####
The best way to stimulate the economy and restoring local small businesses is by giving cash straight to the hands of consumers. $1000/month to everyone is a game changer.
#####
NBC is the Fox News equivalent for Democrats. Unfair and bias media.
#####
Yang 2020!!   
But the 1K a month should ONLY go to those making less than 100k a year.  That‚Äôs the only part that I disagree with him on.  The difference of not paying those can go to Education!!
#####
I m not sure? Cmon bro, let ME have ur freedom dividend then
#####
When news try‚Äôs and pick who they want president and make the others look bad lmao
#####
We have tried everything else and failed ! Government always taking money and doing nothing ! And when crisis happens they choose BANKS OVER PEOPLE !!
So THIS TIME WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHING NEVER TRIED BEFORE !!! Money to people !!! People over banks and corrupt government!!!
WHATS THE DOWNSIDE ? We are not succeeding with current solutions anyways so what‚Äôs there to lose anyways ! 
LETS GIVE YANG A CHANCE ! Let‚Äôs give America a chance
#####
Other politicians  ( Raise taxes and  take money from people to governammt  )  free healthcare , free education , free socialism : GOOD IDEA ( don‚Äôt care and ask if money will come from anywhere and how coz Sounds good ) 
freedom dividend : GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT üò±üò±üò± , nahhhhhh ,  how will we pay for it , long shot , ohhhh , ehhhhhh , whattttttttttt
#####
Failed try !!! THIS IS A GREAT IDEA ! And 1000$ dollars is not TO SOLVE AND LIVE ON MONEY !! It‚Äôs a platform to build our lives with a financial freedom !!! THIS IS THE FOUNDATION ! LIKE PAINKILLERS SO u can have the courage to do the rest of treatment urself and get better !!! It‚Äôs a part of cure NOT THE WHOLE CURE !
#####
Haha ! When GOVERNMENT USED 4 TRILLION DOLLARS TO BAIL OUT BANKS IN 2008 crisis , DID ANYONE OBJECT ???? Nah government didn‚Äôt care , and MONEY WAS TAKEM FROM PEOPLE and given to banks who caused the crash ! THIS TIME WE ARE CHOOSING PEOPLE ! Money to PEOPLE !!! And it‚Äôs OUR money , not a charity , handout , OUR SHARE !!! OUR RIGHT !!! Suddenly if someone says to give money directly to people MEDIA like these cry wolf coz IF PEOPLE GET MONEY POLITICIANS WONT BE ABLE TO TAKE PROFITS !!!
#####
If Yang win the presidency this country will win an it's been along time sense this country has won sense Clinton in the 90s

He doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Yang...he‚Äôll get what he derserves

The poor will be affected by vat? 

No, only those who can spend more than 10k a month will be affected by VAT, and I am very sure if you can spend that kind of money, you are not in the category of "poor".

You can't use Alaska as an example. Here in Alaska everything is expensive. A melon cost 30 dollars. The population hasn't reached 1 million

Yang is a genius and shame on the media and MSNBC in particular for ignoring yang and not treating him seriously. Yang‚Äôs UBI plan would make the entire world a better place.
#####
when nbc realizes they made a mistake not covering but doesnt know how big a mistake that was
#####
The bigger uneducated part of U.S Voters need clarification that ‚ÄúUniversal basic income for every adult over 18‚Äù, is for United States Citizens so they wont throw his whole argument out the window
#####
"Most economists agree a VAT would hit the poor the hardest" is simply not true. The only possible way that would be true is if it was just a flat VAT on everything which is not what Yang wants or what other countries have. Either they are pushing their agenda or incompetent
#####
Please do yourself a favor and look into this guy‚Äôs policies! He has a plan and wants to fix things. #Yang2020
#####
We pay GST 10% tax on items except foods and necessities. I was sceptical. It works. And  the 1k we got during the 2008 crash floated the economy. We didn't go under when nearly EVERYONE else did. Imagine if it were monthly. The economy would boom, you become loyal and want to support brands producing in your country to support your economy. It inspires you a responsibility in you to try to help small business and local companies. It works psychologically and economically.
#####
Why is NBC providing misinformation again? ‚ÄúMost economist‚Äù? How did they come to that conclusion? UBI will help countless individuals and humanity as a whole. Yang for president!

A UBI will give everyone a $6 raise. Hitting ABOVE $15 when combined with the minimum in most states. With this type if economic stimulation, it'd be much easier to then pay a federal minimum of $15 per hour. On Top of that, A UBI will go with you as you grow, train for better jobs, as you advance your career. IT GOES WITH YOU. A group of people can create a business. The local communities will get a DIRECT economic boost. #YangGang

1000 dollars a month will benefit millions of people who is very poor.

Don‚Äôt let TECH company use your data for no reason. Andrew Yang #2020

NBC OR MSNBC WE DON‚ÄôT NEED YOUR SUPPORT OR OPINIONS ON UBI. WE THE PEOPLE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA. AMERICANS RUN ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE DON‚ÄôT NEED MSNBC. WE WILL NEVER WATCH YOUR CABLE NEWS IN THE FUTURE.

@3:30 she told a blatant lie. She says America has never attempted a UBI. False. It passed twice in congress under frwaking Nixon. NBC hold this ‚ÄúL‚Äù.
#####
Worst opinion piece ever.
#####
So you're telling me people could still keep their welfare? Get 1000$? No need to work? 
Oh wait i forget selling food stamps for cash is job too
This is how it will be in real life Mr. Yang 
Im all for your idea i just think you need to eliminate one for the other.
#####
This is why Trump will win 2020. You even do faked news on your own party.
#####
@ 3:24 you say that a nationwide UBI program has never been attempted in America, but you fail to mention that the Nixon era House of Reps passed a nationwide plan not once, but twice. There have been attempts.

Please explain to me how a 10% tax on goods with clothes and groceries totally exempt and paired with a $1000/m tax-free monthly check hits the poor the hardest? Americans, please be smarter than MSM believes you to be and don‚Äôt fall for this nonsense. Of course it hits the highest spenders, AKA the rich, the hardest (and Yang has said luxury goods wealthy people buy could be targeted for higher than 10% VAT), while helping the poorest the most.

Let‚Äôs vote #Yang2020 and make this happen!

I fear the Democrats are going to cut off their nose to spite their face again. ALL Democrats will vote for the Democratic candidate. What you NEED is the ONE Democrat who can also bank millions of Republican votes. The only one you have that can do that is BIDEN....This Republican WANTS TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN and their are many more like me out there. But give us Sanders, Warren  or Trump and you will likely get 4 more years of the jerk we have now. Just speaking the truth. We will not vote for Sanders or Warren but we will vote.
#####
DNC will be dumb not to listen to Republicans for Yang.

#####
About 4 years ago, I was someone hoping Bernie wouldn't lose, and when he got pushed out and bent to the will of Hillary and the DNC, I lost hope in our system. A year ago I didn't know who Andrew Yang is. Around 10 months ago I started seeing stuff about him float around online, I thought Yang and his $1000 was a gimmick/joke with no way of ever passing or functioning, and I was wary of seeing Sanders jump back in after he caved last time. Cut to today, after having watched dozens of interviews and reading more news and research data than I have ever thought I'd be interested in, Andrew Yang is the only one that gives me hope again, and the only one I believe Trump is afraid of. Its not just the fact that he has been caught saying Yang is the only real threat. His intelligence would tear Trump apart on the debate stage. Yang scored a 1220 out of 1600 on his SAT when he was only 12 years old. He was on the US National debate team at one point. He holds a 780 out of 800 GMAT. All of Trump's typical attacks won't work because he's an outsider business man like Trump was, except Yang doesn't have a streak of bankrupt businesses in his past, just one and he admits he learned from his mistake and has been successful ever since that one learning experience. What is he gonna do after the usual stuff falls apart? Be super racist, call him a commie Chinaman? Communism is when the government controls the means of production (i.e. federally mandated jobs and wages) and UBI is just about the opposite. Hell, making sure people have money to spend is capitalist af. And it's been interwined in our history. Thomas Paine and Milton Friedman have brought up similar ideas, MLK jr. spoke about the automation of jobs and labor and how a guaranteed income would be needed to solve many of society's problems, Greg Mankiw (one of the leading minds of modern large scale economics, Prof. of Econ. at Harvard, lifelong republican) has even said that Yang is the one putting a plan on the table that makes sense. It almost passed almost 50 years ago, the only reason it didn't was because nobody could agree on how much. Anything else Trump could possibly come at him with can either be handled with the facts and research, or parried by Donald Trump's own words, thanks to twitter. And none of the others are realistically going to pull off Trump supporters or hardcore republicans, at best Bernie can pull the "not Hillary" voters of 2016. Yang is different, he can get all kinds of support across the board. If you want proof, go to the comment section of his Ben Shapiro interview, or any Yang videos on Fox official YT, its filled with conservatives that say "this guy makes sense" or "I would vote for him if he was the the democrat, only him". The reason the media doesn't talk much about him and gets his name wrong or excludes him from polls is because he could make real change happen that could help people and it would hurt their bottom line. I doubt I can post links without them being deleted but if I can I'll try to drop them in the replies
#####
Have you not heard that we want Yang?
#####
This presidency election is going to be better than world series and Superbowl combine but also makes me feel bad for the human race for reason similar to the movie idiocracy
#####
Of course ABC uses a graphic of money printing when they mention andrew yang's proposition for UBI. This tactic is unbelievably misleading in regard to his proposition. They are trying to insinuate that he will haphazardly cause inflation with his UBI plan by introducing more money to the economy similar to the QE bailouts of the past decade.  This is an example of media propaganda subvertingly raping the subconscious of their viewers so that they can quietly own our thoughts.  Yang wants to use currency that already "exists" in the economy which will not cause inflation in the same way that "printing" would.  ABC should use that graphic for their next report on the Fed's current repo operation that has been bailing out the G-SIBs like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs by conjuring up billions of dollars every business day out of nowhere ever since September 17th 2019 and is still going on to today...oh wait that's not being reported...oooops!

The reason why the US is dying is people stop caring about politics. Andrew brings hope and energy to politics like Obama did. He was in Obama administration. However, he is an entrepreneur, not a politician.
#####
Fox treating Yang fairly is a sign of how republicans and conservatives will vote for him more than any other democrat.
#####
Tulsi is like Yang's shield lol
#####
Yang 2020. Donate to Andrew Yang to help him reach 1 mil

I always believed in fox news!!!!!!! Yang 2020!!!

Do Maths, not drugs:


M - marijuana
A - alcohol
T - tobacco
H - heroin
S - salvia


See? By promoting thinking again by using MATHS... we can also help drug addicts find a better way to recover!

(Yang can say MATH if he wishes. However, I recognize MATHS as a plural.)
#####
100% for Yang, followed by Trump
#####
If only ...
Yang Can Cook
#####
I am not American but I understand his facts and he blasts truth and tells things as they are and how they could be. He unites both left and right in way that helps all prosper and alleviate the heavy symptoms and disturbing side effects of capitalism that it has. Its capitalism in a humane way that hasn't been tested widely but locally. Search his ideas and policies. They have been proposed by the world bank and a plethora of economic professionals old and new.

Guess what before Jane Sanders bankrupted Burlington College. Carina her daughter was funneled students and money to Vermont Wood Working school she Co owne's with her husband. 500k in student money was embezzled off Burlington College. I wonder if Bernie will hug and support the victims of the sexist attacks his Bernie Bros did to citizens. So Bernie has lots of scumbag sneaky supporters. The kind of sociopaths that think they are immune and justified in their attacks. " Please show us on the Teddy bear where the bad Bernie Bro touched you " üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

When Fox reports on Andrew Yang while MSNBC continues ignoring him. üß¢
#####
Find Jesus, he is the way the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father except by him. Jesus is our saviour he died on the cross and rose again for those who repent and turn from there sins believe in what he did at the cross and become born again. 
Nwo coming. If everyone is this excited for money to make it, imagine when the mark of the beast comes and all the world will bend at the knee in a heart beat for it.
#####
Texas Yang Gang was popping off at that rally. I feel really good about him winning this state if he can win NH or Ia
#####
It's cool that Yang is getting air time here but why in the world does Fox 4 have the audio quality of a 1994 local news station? Their video is fantastic, did they spend their whole budget on cameras and forget about mics?
#####
This video has aged well. Quinnipac 4% qualifier got him with 2 days to spare. What a maverick.
#####
And qualify he did!!! Go Yang, go!!
#####
Trump's rallies are 20 times larger than this gathering. It was cute though.  His followers look like the  typical libtard... Young,  dumb,  brainwashed and clueless how the world works.  Most still live in parents basement
#####
I was out of town past weekend but if he comes to Dallas next time I want to attend
#####
Hillary Clinton is definitely out of touch with america and laser beam focused on nuclear war along with the rest of the vile and desolate regime.

Thankyou Fox for coverage

The only thing that should matter is  if Yang has the better agenda than Trump to move America forward.  And I love the Yang Gang tag.

GET. THAT. BAG.

Wow this is crazy wonder if he will meet Jeremy Lin

I have a feeling he‚Äôs polling way over 4%

Thank you for covering Andrew Yang!  Nice piece :)

Uber driver in Dallas and pick someone up from the rally, not knowing Andrew was in town. I forgot to check my email, so I had no clue he was in. I was so pissed I didn't get to go, but one of the writers that I picked up gave me a "Humanity first" poster. Super grateful. But next time I'll be more diligent... üòÅ

He's still running?  Longest touring standup comic ever.  They're taking him seriously.

Yang qualified for the Dec debates btw.

‚ÄúSmall rally???‚Äù 
It was huge. How big are other rallies?
These people are trying real hard to make him look like a joke. What a bunch of assholes.
#####
he is good . but inexperienced. he would be a good pick for vice president for any winning democractic nominee ( hopefull bernie) . but in the future he should definitely try again ..
#####
Very nice coverage of the campaign.
#####
I think he's the best cabdidate for the Dem.
By the way, why am i watching this? I'm not even american.
#####
Feel the Yang!
#####
I hope in the next debate he mentions his name being left out of polls and if people want to make it happen vote for it . its the only way forward.
#####
Great report! Go Fox and Yang!
#####
Everyone is Yang Gang, they just don't know it yet.
#####
For all the Yang Gang Bangs if you think your rally is big, go watch Trump rallies. That's what you call BIG rally.

if Andrew Yang didn‚Äôt win democratic nominee , So I blame Media, because of  MSNBC we must support Yang2020  or Trump 2020.

I so so agree with this...It really bothers me seeing a senior citizen still working his/her butt off.  I do not want to do that after I'm 60.  At such age living in this country, I should be able to wake up to smell the fresh air and enjoy what little time I have left instead of still heading out to work every day to tend to some hard labor job for my survival.
#####
32 Trump supporter dislike this video because they don't know how to get money free lol

Please win my dad needs the money he is 60 years old and he still has to work. Im only twelve but I understand all the pains he goes through everyday.üò•
#####
LOL Literally buying votes. This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. What does giving everyone $1k a month accomplish?  My god, sad part is voters just see $1k for themselves and do not care who or how it is paid for... Guys like this are so full of shite.

Andrew Yang does not support medicare for all!

Guess what people. You better graduate cause if you dropped out and didnt finish school you aren't allowed the 1k UBI at 18 until 21. Its also in his policy he doesn't mention.
#####
Yang, Medicare for All is a Bill. Not a name.
#####
Yang gang
#####
Yes yang!!
#####
Im just going to make a youtube video explaining what you lie about since you keep trying to hide the truth about screwing over SSI, Food stamps and tanf people by making them give up those benefits in order to get only your UBI. I want to see you delete my video! Prick! Liar!
#####
in france we already have a minimum wage of 800 euros for seniors even if they have never worked in their lives and its illigal by law to hire an old person , i was shocked to see that in the usa old people work  i saw a very old man in mcdonalds working
#####
Andrew Yang will hit small local businesses with the same flat VAT as big corporations but will do nothing to get big corporations to pay the sales taxes and employment taxes and payroll that small local businesses pay...

His VAT is not a tax on big corporations, Automation, Data Transfers, Artificial Intelligence or Online Sales... These should be the taxes he is looking at not a VAT on small local businesses...

This is unfair as hell...
#####
Yang has my vote. And should have yours too unless your name is Jeff Bezos
#####
Not if were disabled on SSI disability benefits which is the poorest disability Social security offers at now $783 a month max amount unless in Cali, then its near a grand a month SSI since cost of living there is so expensive and we have to have food stamps ect.. He takes all that away and forces only us to have to make a choice between our current benefits or just UBI. We can't stack it together like everyone else gets to. Im not voting to get the short end of the stick on this. Its discrimination loud and clear by treating us different and unfairly to others. Read the UBI policy on his website on how UBI will be funded and how he stiffs those of us unfortunate enough to be on SSI and poor welfare programs. He puts restrictions only on us. Its not right or fair to do that only to us while handing rich people a free EXTRA 1k a month without restrictions.
#####
I'm one of the thumbs down cause you lie!
#####
Well thank you, this is grounds to sue you now over false advertisment. You said everyone on social security gets a additional 1k a month. Liar! Read your policy and you will see where anyone on SSI disability and YES, SSI is social security to and people on food stamps and tanf ect... Can't keep those benefits and get UBI with it as extra. You put restrictions on the poorest of poor and yet in every damn thing you post you never mention this detail about UBI. No one else has this restriction put on them to have to give up income and assistance for 1K UBI. You force them to have to make a choice of one over the other. Yet anyone on SSDI up to a rich person will get 1k as extra a month but you single out those of us on SSI DISABILITY AND WELFARE POOR PROGRAMS WE NEED. We need that 1k UBI as extra like you promise everyone in your campaigns but you're lying. We have restrictions put on us to give up our current income if we want UBI. That is discrimination by treating a small group of people unfairly different than others. You should be sued for lying like this and never telling the truth to the American people that may vote for you and blind sided to know that they are the ones that has to give up benefits for UBI. You will not allow SSI, food stamps, tanf ect.... to stack with 1k a month UBI. But you allow every worker and SSDI disability people all the way up to a billionare to get 1k UBI extra a month no restrictions and that is not right. Stop lying to people. The people that need UBI as EXTRA the most in this life to get ahead and out of poverty is the people you're putting restrictions on to get just UBI. You are not a good man to single the poorest of poor out and never mentioning it in your debates and campaigns. You keep lying saying we ALL get a extra 1k  a month no questions asked no strings attached and added to our current income. Not to poor SSI disability and welfare poor people. You treat them like scum like we all don't deserve extra help like you'll spoil to everyone else. Not RIGHT! Stop LYING!

Wait a minute.  If I buy a house for a million dollars, do I have to pay the 10% value added tax of $ 100,000?  Is the value added tax on top of California's sales tax?  So now Californians pay almost 20% tax, plus property tax, state and federal income tax, social security and Medicare tax, and now vat for food, medicine, water, electricity, trash...where does it end? Bye bye $ 12,000? We need more information.

I have seen a lot of elderly working menial part time retail jobs and they look so sad and miserable. I would too if I knew had the do the same thing until the day I die.

Think about it, even if you take out the freedom dividend, yang is still the best candidate. That‚Äôs how much better he is than the others

my work place still got people over 65 years of age, they need to stay home and enjoy the rest of their lives, but they working like me, a young man

Thank you Andrew Yang for caring about us! YangGang 2020! Happy Holidays!
#####
in addition to social security benefit? Since when did that change? I was under the impression $12000 is to replace social security. This will be a disaster.
#####
Social security is a a Ponzi scheme. Young people and working folk have to keep working to fund it. But the birth rate is not growing fast enough to keep up with the ever growing aging population of those over 65 and receiving benefits. This social security model is unsustainable. Got a find a new way to take care of the seniors who will live well past prior avgs, breaking new records in longevity. Meanwhile the underemployed, in debt, young folks are just barely building a savings for the future.
#####
Someone I know is 67 yo and is still working at her job because if she were to retire at 62 yo, her Social Security payments would not be enough to live on.  The Freedom Dividend would have allowed her to retire at age 62 yo with dignity.
#####
$1,000.00 a month for every legal American citizen would definitely change the lives of the American people.  That's  $12,000.00 a year more than we have now.  But the gov't is capable of matching that adding up to $24,000.00 a year for each person with a few minor changes to current laws that Yang is focusing on already.  The mass effect of economic growth for this country would immediately show results and continue  flourishing our economy.  No one would get left behind.  Everyone would succeed on a massive growth scale.   Fixing America is easier than our current Gov't system wants you to believe.  By supporting Andrew Yang, we ALL have a chance to live life and enjoy it.  My support lies with the man who has answers!  Yang for President 2020! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
#####
This is by far your best ad yet.
#####
Technically the gov't can also issue a second monthly check of $1,000.00 a month for ever legal American citizen quite easily if just a few laws are passed that Andrew Yang is already considering as our New Potential President.  This country can definitely be fixed by focusing on both the micro and macro economics.  Yang has the right ideas, and the Math adds up.  I will definitely vote YANG into office and propose the 2nd check system to his cabinet for consideration of minor to max economic growth for this country which would in turn affect the global markets and change the face of this world from poverty to penthouse.  Vote YANG in 2020!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ America needs a Leader who can do the Math!!

It sounds nice but is realistic?

Thank u keeping going

Lost me at wanting to impeach trump, bye yang you will be irrelevant once more
#####
When you see futuristic societies in books/movies, you see machines and software doing a lot of work for us. And yet the majority of America is stuck in the 80's like Trump, thinking that we all have to work ourselves to death to give our lives meaning. I'm tired of working 50 hours a week, it gives me no meaning. 

Like Yang says, universal basic income is inevitable and there is no downside to starting it sooner than later. He is the visionary we need to evolve this economy and society to put humanity first.
#####
Americans are too busy just to get their next pay check .....they donot know about yang's actually policies for america and every american .... they donot know this guy is giving everyone 12 thousand usa freedom dividend real money a year 18+ till death. just  so real people with real problems can breath alot easier and actuaally focus on real problem of this world ....i find it ironic and dumb ....these days governments are just like private company that runs on taxing the poor middle and upper class but its all free for billionaires (kings and queens of us)
#####
Yanggang!
#####
This is for you Mr Yang:  How can you support a man that has been chosen by Washington to overthrow a sovereign country, and just walk in there and claim he's the new president?  You know I'm talking about Venezuela.  I wish you would do your research on what is happening in S America today.  Washington is controlling the elections in many of those countries. And the indigenous peoples of those countries are the ones who are suffering do to our policies down there. I guess I should be more in order with the idea that it's all about "America first."  But I, like many today, happen to care about what my country does to our neighbors. I understand that you, according to what you've said, support the US position on meddling in sovereign countries. Your platform is inspiring, however, I'm not sure I can support your run for the presidency, when you seem to be naive about something that means so much to me.

Very glad Andrew highlighted ‚Äúin addition to social security services‚Äù - does the pro rate system occur in the USA, it does in Australia.  Whatever is earned over a certain threshold is then deducted on a pro rata basis from welfare payments.
#####
I will vote for Andrew Yang so that grandmother and grandfather can retire with dignity at 67 years old.
#####
you have to be uninformed or blind to dislike this!
#####
Most old people work not because they need money,  it is because they are fucking bored. Most of the working elderly would be making the same income from Social Security if they just stayed home all day.
#####
It is actually most depressing to see seniors with health problems and weak bodies working to make ends meet until the day they die.... more so than anything else. I really hope UBI gets implemented and help a lot of them. At least work only a little bit or not needing to work...
#####
Yang's UBI is a Trojan Horse that is funded by looting the social safety net by 80% and a regressive tax and furthers wealth inequality.

He's not for a Living wage for full-time workers, Higher Education and Healthcare as a Human Right, student and medical debt cancellation, or a Federal Jobs Guarentee.
#####
Let's work to put this man to office
#####
Yang for president.
#####
If Biden says " I endorse yang" and drops our, yang will win.
#####
Ss benefits is simply getting back what we already paid.
#####
Share this ad in your social media, mainly facebook, so that more seniors can see this. They need $1000 a month, additional, to retire comfortably. Will be a big win for seniors.
#####
Democrats love free stuff BUT who is going to pay? Yang?
#####
This will help cycle off some welfare and help actual people.
#####
Excellent ad!  Hits all the right notes. Get this on TV in Iowa, NH, NV, and SC.   Boomers such as myself will support Yang and vote for him in greater numbers, and so will our kids, who are worried about us in our declining years. It‚Äôs a 2 for 1 vote getter.
#####
perfect...
#####
Huh a few months ago you said that you would pay for UBI by VAT taxes?
#####
At $1000 month per person over 18, it'll be about a $2.5 trillion dollar a year. That's fucking insane.
#####
I approve this message!
#####
48 trillion dollars a year, oh boy another let me see how fast I can  bankrupt America  promise.  You numbskulls are willing to sellout your country for 12,000 $. get a job make more and save your country from yet another leftwingI can not do basic math but can pull magical numbers out of my ass

America - don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity for  a happier future

Read this thread there isn‚Äôt a jackass who is racist or anything in here
#####
I fucks wit the freedom dividend and want him president no matter if he changes this or not but why not take 10% of the gains of every corporation instead of a stupid tax that has hurt a lot of people in other countries 10% of every purchase without putting that on the end consumer which would bring in more revenue too. It would be the easiest simplified tax ever and companies won‚Äôt even have to invest more into the  administration area like the value added tax will do when we dislike it when schools do it why not in this instance too
#####
Make since to me
#####
I cant wait for cnn to react to the real numbers yang pulls in
#####
I'm 66 years old and live on $1,400 a month. $2,400 a month would be HUGE!! I could fix my car. I could fix the RV I live in and no more eating crappie food from Food Banks!  YIPPEE!!!

Oh, wait... Yang probably won't be President...and even if he does become President, McDonnell's Mafia will probably still be in power...üòñ

YES YES YES 
Now this is how you do it Andrew! 
People will turn there heads to this especially the older generation.
#####
Andrew Yang: "Our senior citizens are working until the day they die..."

One slight correction, candidate Yang! At least SOME of our senior citizens are NOT "working until the day they die." Oh, they fervently & prayerfully WISH that they COULD BE "working until the day they die," so serious are their concerns. ...but they CAN'T.  Many have disabling impairments, judged "severe" by a Social Security Disability Magistrate, which nevertheless do not prevent them TRYing to find work. It's just that, few entrepreneurs, still less corporations, are willing to hire them. Or even interview them. Whatever, it's cool.
#####
Yeah but what will Yang do for Black People?!?
#####
I‚Äôm on your side Andrew Yang
#####
Merry Xmas to you n your family President Yang...

*Giving free money is Commie to the bones!  No to this closet GOP!*

This will literally improve the quality of life in America.
#####
Ahhhhhh get more views! He needs to spread, his policies are best for USA, no doubt about it. Basing it on logic and evidence, all he needs is people to listen and they will agree. Poll higher and he will gather votes! I really hope he doesn't drop out. Even if his vote splits the party we need this man in order to win the election. Not speaking from a Democrat side, speaking from the side of USA
#####
You have to have a deep love and interest in the late 60s to be able to parody it this well. This is more about a certain kind of boomer spiritual adventurer than it is about a specific drug. Yang and mushrooms aren't really the point.
#####
These mushrooms literally saved my life. I planned to kill myself at the end of November 2017. 

A friend of mine gave some to me 2 DAYS before my scheduled suicide. I'm doing fantastic today. 


No more suicidal thoughts.
#####
I get that this is comedy but I somehow find this wrong...We need a serious talk about psychedelic (for their benefits) and finally someone in the political sphere is willing to do so. I hope it will happen,

Loooooove.

-A random dude from Qu√©bec who hopes you‚Äôll shroom.
#####
If that's what a shrooms trip looks like...I don't think I ever want to try them.
#####
Y'all. It's a joke. On a comedy show. Please stop self destructing. It's the actual news media's job to educate people on policy and shrooms and medicine and all that good shit. Colbert is here to entertain and that was funny and unbiased.
#####
Disappointed ... he is one of the most serious candidates about trying to help the people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwW8-R9TH5I and yes psilocybin is being used for depression research
#####
Thats not how they work.......
#####
After multiple deployments I spent 4 years shut in and unable to leave my apartment and socialize in unfamiliar places without severe anxiety/Panic attacks.  Small doses of mushrooms have given me my life back and allowed me to rejoin the rest of society.   Please stop making insensitive jokes that keep stigmatizing a revolutionary treatment to one of the number one causes for suicide (PTSD). 
Colbert was one of the people that got me to laugh at myself and not be such a "conservative douche", So out of respect I'd like to politely request this issue be re-addressed in some way shape or form.
Love the show, Enjoy your holidays!
#####
Seems to me that if we are cool with psychedelics we‚Äôd be chill enough to take a joke. This fierce and predictable ‚Äúcome to his defense‚Äù on the part of Yang supporters parallels that of the support shown to no. 45. Anyone who slights the hero will be taken down. Very much an ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù strategy these days.
#####
I'm not American, never been there
But I would definitely vote for him
#####
i‚Äôm not offended in any way and can see how a simpleton w no prior psychedelic experiences could find this humorous. but laughing at the fact that he‚Äôs want to legalize psylocybin mushrooms is kind of like..ugh so i even have to explainüíÄ
#####
oh, people claim the medical uses as reasons to legalize psychedelics, but if they were truly honest, they would admit they are just looking for something to avoid dealing with reality.
I lived through the 60's and I saw those fake excuses all the time.
Most people don't understand or don't want to understand the scientific and ethical restrictions on actual medicines.
#####
Jesus cucked me with shrooms.
"Listen to your sister"
Because you guys would have pay attention to each other's problems.
And women who just walk over people can get away with it because she's not smart.

Service sucks the best guy you you guys had is dead.

" stupid sinner"
A sinner against Jew.

They don't care about God.
Guys I'm the one with the light but I'm the lazy person.
Can you guys even handle that fact?
It's because the eyes of the Lord are forcing me to be molested.

I just want them my waifu and to live with my family.

I don't even know what else to tell you guys.

The meaning of things is meaningless.

" your love sucks"

I was a Priceless Joy.

I'm literally the dog.

They f***** me over I was the king of my own kingdom in someone have to steal everything from me including my wife kids job.

At the next door neighbor's awesome I wish I can just suck it rip my heart out.
I hate this body.

Because she doesn't want to learn anymore you guys wanted me to stay alive.

Then you guys blame me stupid devils.

I'm basically stuck with the child molester cuz I didn't tell the truth sooner.

Everyone who gets molested gets fucked.

And then I see a man lifting up a wine glass.

Because you guys won't save me my son lost his way cuz it's a cheating disgrace it's not fair.


I've been told to hurt others for the show for the rich people because it's really bored for them.

 and apparently I'm supposed to die cuz I'm just a peasant and you guys couldn't agree more.

It's all mind control all expectation.

You guys judged him for being weak.
And he wanted to die so he can live.

A little girl wrote me out of the story.
And now I'm just a sad Old Devil crying like a b****.
It's not fair to Satan and Satan is my body.
 imagine if Applejack from My Little Pony says I like the child molester man because at least he was a good father.

 and the money wanted to be in my hands but they(you) didn't care.

 I have the projection of Innocents in me that's why I need to pass down my gene.

 Jesus Took her and left me to die here and guess who Jesus is my stepfather now he's going to torture me forever because I told the truth.
 and grandma doesn't believe in your shrooms.
 She Believes In Jesus in the Bible and religion.

Guess what my son died for you lady.
 so I'm literally the true Jesus.
 and the other guy is stealing my face.

 so in my head I see my step father's face when I look in the mirror I feel anger and sadness towards myself.

 I can't even love my waifu.
 you guys don't believe in her.

 and to be honest I think these bodies are cocoons and the wife who is the moth with in and I needed to turn into my wife.

 and apparently the child molester is my husband.

 so I honestly need help from a woman because I'm a crybaby and you guys are going to keep wondering why.

 it's just mother had a lot of Hope in the girls and Jesus put a lot of faith in the women.

 oh yeah and apparently evil for telling people to work when you're in a job environment they're just kids trying to have fun.

 the teenagers stole This Love This Heart this experience away from me.

 and you guys are going to tell me to go eat s*** and this is why I started the whole experience the first place was like why are you guys assholes to each other.

 I just want money to help my mom and apparently I was supposed to die to prove my manliness.

 I'm not a man because I didn't change or I didn't kill myself.

 I was trying to save the child.
 I've been hit by spiritual radiation.

"Bye Christ"
Tears*
sob*
 the unborn baby in me cries because he doesn't know if I'm the father or my stepfather is the father Within me.

 and I didn't want to have a baby because after that my mother in me wanted her husband.
 now I'm not strong enough because all I feel is pretty for you.

 all of you are the Body of Christ.

 I wanted love for "tanel".
 his actions to me speak louder than words.

 but at this point they hate me I'm just a charlatan.
 I just didn't have the guts.
  I got used to like toothpaste and now I'm seeing and I have to go to hell forever.

 and since my step-dad molested me it's like he pre-programmed to me to die.
:if you tell anyone ill kill you"

 That's why he was so scared that's why she still a child in spirit that's why you guys don't respect the little kid because he's just a f****** dirty little devil trying to get through the Gates of Heaven.

Psychedelic Mushrooms have medical use when used properly and with responsibility. To lock someone up and ruin their life for them. I think we have bigger fish to fry. no victim no crime,...... I agree with Yang
#####
There are medical benefits to psylocilbn in controlled amounts.  It's been found to help with anxiety and PTSD.   Andrew Yang follows the science and the data.
#####
this is cheap, Stephen, and stupid. I bet you and your team didn't even bother to understand what he said. your agenda is showing..

this show is acting like they are in line with people's standpoint and knows what's good and what's bad, while in reality it is trying to herd public opinions into their direction.

I realize people in comment section, tends to look at the "what he said" rather than the "why he is doing it for". 

‚ÄúWe should explore making psilocybin mushrooms legal for medical and therapeutic use particularly for veterans,‚Äù. Andrew Yang.

The words of the day are "EXPLORE", "MEDICAL", "THERAPEUTIC", "PARTICULARLY", "VETERANS".

Colbert is a spin master, he lost all credibility with me.
#####
I mean, he's 100% correct. They have SO MUCH medical benefit with almost no medical risk. Seriously, Yang is making a lot of sense with this one.
#####
Yang is the best candidate.
#####
Laughed all you want, we definitely need to study this further. Andrew Yang was right.
#####
I get that it's a comedy show, but this really undermines and trivializes an important topic. Stephen should know better, having had Michael Pollan on the show. Pollan's book is a journalistic masterpiece that delves into the critical use of psilocybin on cancer patients. John's Hopkins University is doing cutting edge research and recommends reclassification from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule IV drug that has medical benefits. Crap skits like this only keep people numbed and dumb.
#####
youve honestly been trash since you left the colbert report :/
#####
What‚Äôs the song tho??
#####
Yeah let‚Äôs just ignore the fact that shrooms has the potential to cure depression.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that Colbert will always live in Steve Carrell‚Äôs shadow. Sorry buddy. The world knows it.

Colbert is a DNC puppet! Best Democratic candidates are Yang and Gabbard. But the racism within the Democrats won't allow Yang the chance and because Tulsi is non partisan she is not acceptable to them either. They are the only 2 candidates they have worth anything. Sanders is a hypocrite and the others well.....they don't have a chance against Trump.

THE LIST OF YANG ENDORSERS:

Barack Obama
Casey Neistat
Dave Chapelle
Donald Glover
Elon Musk
the list goes on...

I‚Äôll leave it to you USA.
#####
Ok. (1) Mushrooms are being explored as a medicine for helping treat PTSD [1], which was the context Yang was referring to approving using mushrooms for (you can find him saying this in another youtube video). (2) The idea that the government should be allowed to tell you what you can or cannot do with *your own body* and your own safety is the exact OPPOSITE of freedom. If you support the 2nd Amendment like me, are you really then going to backtrack and say "oh, but I'm totally cool with the government busting down my door, shooting my dog for understandably barking (yes this is actually SWAT protocol), and arresting me because I picked a local mushroom I found growing outside and brought it into my house". And yes you actually will be arrested for possession of a *mushroom* in most areas of the US. (3) The entire War on Drugs has been a sham effort by the government, in part to be able to arrest people so they could prevent oppressed groups from organizing and rallying to fight against their oppression. Nixon's own aid John Ehrlichman actually admitted this in a 1994 interview: "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I‚Äôm saying? We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did." [2].

There are a lot of science researches say medicinal psilocybin should be allowed for the purpose of relieving Depression. It is not a joke and it is not funny...... Colbert should not have mocked Yang on the mushroom.

For the record: magic mushrooms (MMs) are NOT ADDICTIVE. Science proved that psilocybin, the active ingredient of MMs, is not addictive. See more information here: http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Psilocybin_Mushrooms_Fact_Sheet.pdf
#####
Clearly Jewish programming. Nice, sneakily mocking people who are against circumcision.
#####
It is a non-scientific stereotype to think that psychedelics are only recreational and have no use as medicine or else. This joke is misinforming and I find it insulting. The Late Show sound like boomer's talking, also showing some fear propaganda from the 60's against LSD, which was designed to create fear among the public and stop research, shameful and ignorant.

Talk about him more

Nothing wrong with the shrooms

for context, here is Yang's actual take on mushrooms, hate how Colbert flipped it   >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXs_eSFmYDQ

This joke is extremely out of touch. The main thing they contain, psilocybin, has been proven to be able to treat depression of many different kinds, and the benefits outweigh the negatives. I love you to pieces, Stephen, but please.

I love how Yang always gives the same answer on impeachment:

*Every Democrat Ever*: Don't you agree with us that we should impeach donald trump?

*Yang*: yeah, but how about we stop giving him attention. You know you're just playing into his hand, right?
#####
#Yang2020
#####
Warren and Sander's plans are too hard to implement.  Too many ways for the rich to evade that tax and too much work for the IRS every year.  $1,000 a month is much easier to implement via a simple VAT tax.  It actually works similar to the idea of "Taxing the rich".  If you are rich and has a lavish lifestyle that buys tons of stuff, you will pay more VAT tax.  If you are a frugal single mom, you won't buy as much, but still get $1,000 a month to help you with your expenses.

The UBI is smart, because when you raise minimum wage then the companies response by cutting hours and jobs.. Lowering their cost so they still make the profit they projected and upholding to their shareholders.. it‚Äôs ridiculous for a s

UBI could be better than the current welfare system as long as its completely scrapped, along with the complete elimination of the minimum wage. But automation is not the problem.  Government labor laws, taxes, and regulations are killing jobs. Automation is mitigating the damage.

#####
Everyone talks about Amazon sucking 30% of malls but Nobody is talking about how Andrew Yang is sucking up 30% of American voters every day.
#####
Yang is the bipartisan breaker candidate. The one with policies that satisfy both sides and the common people.

He's not talking about massive social programs or proportional wealth tax hikes. The Dems can agree with him because his policies would massively help the working class with a safety net. The conservatives can agree with him (or at least accept him) because his major policy actually would trim the fat of "social" policies while bolstering the overall economy (a trickle "up" effect, if you will). Common people can agree with him because his policies will bolster their own lives and give individual freedom to decide what areas of their lives need the most monetary attention.

If we must live in a super corporatist society, then a BUI is going to be necessary, lest the weight of the upper class crushes the lower class. Yang Gang for life... Let's save this country from bipartisan bullshit. Let's save this country from itself.

Off topic but was the woman there just to look pretty? Why didn't they give her any questions? What is up with that ABC?
#####
You know what is really awesome? I remember wishing Elizabeth Warren would run last cycle. I remember being super sad Bernie didn't get up. Now there are so many people on that stage I could like. But even among all the awesome, YANG is still so far ahead of them in my mind. 

For a LONG time, many decades, I have wished for a candidate that didn't care about ideological crap. That was NOT AFRAID to say something like "decriminalise drugs" because all that person would do is just search for world's best practice and go for that. No matter how it plays, no matter if it's popular. He'll bring the vision and educate people to MAKE it popular if people see that it is true.

YANG is my guy. World's best practice. Data and practical solutions over belief.

And the other thing, he's up there to communicate with the other candidates. He's respectful of their position and doesn't care about winning for himself but for others. I mean, the people who want it the most and the last who should have it. Yang is all these things.
#####
EVERYONE GET REGISTERED AS A DEMOCRAT SO ANDREW CAN WIN THE PRIMARIES, EVEN IF YOU WANT TRUMP TO WIN. IF TRUMP LOSES TO YANG, YOU STILL WIN BECAUSE YOU'LL BE GETTING $1000 A MONTH FOR LIFE DEPOSITED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT !

Only it isnt a dividend.¬† It is a redistribution of wealth - primarily from the upper and middle class - that will be funded by a VAT - which is a tax on consumers, not on businesses.

Andrew Yang has a grasp and understanding at what is the underlying forces that are causing the effects. The negative perception of UBI has been conditioned and stigmatized by the wealthy for generations. It is perceived as a handout, charity something that should be shameful. The reality is it the most practical solution that kills multi birds with one stone. It should appeal to both the Left & Right. Let me explain my understanding that it not only makes sense, but it vitally necessary!

Everything revolves around the concept of LEVERAGE. Leverage is the SUPER POWER that enables and  multiplies ones ability to carry MORE with LESS. The UBI (Freedom Dividend) really represents LEVERAGE. The $1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage the situation. Once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum. As we know leverage is the key ingredient that enables the ability to carry multiple times your weight. This enables and minimizes the probability in burdening others in helping to carry that weight. Some people like Chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery, essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage. Their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain. As everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times. Their leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level. So the larger the gap the more extreme the leverage becomes. The wealthy which hold the higher ground have little incentive to circulate that wealth back into the system which may compromise their leverage.

Can anyone deny that $1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling. To teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind. In Fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching. And for the growing homeless population across this country, what could $1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job. Raising the Minimum Wage will not even come close to the impact of a $1000 a month will do. If fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee. This helps both Business owner and provides more money in hand to support that business with patronage.

The time has come to break the STIGMA and MYTHS  which we have been conditioned to. Especially The Trickle Down Economy Myth. The WEALTHY ARE NOT JOB CREATORS!!! CUSTOMERS ARE!! No Business can exist without CUSTOMERS. You may have the Greatest Products or Services and it still will not make a difference without CUSTOMERS. So if people CANNOT AFFORD your goods or service, then guess what? You will go OUT OF BUSINESS! If you are a Company or Businessman then it would be in your own best interest to support something like UBI. Otherwise, to support these Wealthy Pricks with TAX BREAKS and SUBSIDIES is beyond short sighted and will ultimately work Against your interests. A greater wealth gap will only cause DESPERATION and ANXIETY which will build even greater Economic Instability and lead to Crime. A real Powder Keg which can have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of Civil Unrest. Your GREED AND SELFISHNESS has left you Blind to the obvious. The Obvious move is you will receive a greater amount of wealth if it is spread out and not concentrated; instead of choking and Killing the golden goose up front. It would be much wiser to feed and look out for the Gooses best interest, you will be rewarded with a flow of Golden Eggs.

The biggest criticism to UBI is the cost. Again this is Short sighted blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board. Starting with the release of pressure and anxiety that scarcity brings. It allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of abundance instead of scarcity. With a scarcity mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials. This effects businesses with less patronage. With less desperation creates less need to commit crimes. With economic despair many commit crimes to purposely be locked up to gain food and shelter. A burden on the tax payer. Huge amount of money saved by minimizing the welfare bureaucracy system. And as Andrew Yang suggest a value added tax of fraction of a percent per purchase would not even be noticed.

And for all you champions of CAPITALISM.

It's time to receive our our dividends from our other Capital ventures we have invested in. Like the Military Arms Industry and Financial Industry. Starting the for profit military arms manufacturing Industry. This Industry is Technically a damaging type Socialism. A Socialism that does not serve society, instead it uses society as a means of CAPITAL. It is called Subsidized Capital. "We the People" subsidize the industry through government contracts. Contracts which are financed through the capital provided by taxes. Thus if this was truly a Capitalist venture then "We the People" are investors and should share in the profits gained from that capital. That capital enable the means of the production. As investors not only did we not receive a dividend when arms are sold to other nations. The US sells weapons and Military equipment to many Nations around the world. Creating huge profits. Profits which were enabled by the Peoples Capital. If we are a true Capitalist system then those who provide their Capital to risk should receive a dividend for their investment. And it time to receive our dividends for providing the bail out CAPITAL to the Wall Street Financial Industry.

I meant to click most on comments here.  I just need to say Andrew Yang is the next US president.  The Democrats will make another huge mistake if they don't nominate Andrew Yang.
#####
Yang gangüíô
#####
-free thousan dorra
-more taxes

What did he mean by this?
#####
This is who we need in office, a guy who is focused on doing what‚Äôs right for all Americans and not wasting anymore of our time and energy on Trump issues
#####
how can u not like this guy, he‚Äôs really likeable, respectful, and really smart
#####
Andrew Yang "The special one"
#####
üëé short sighted and juvenile.  why not $2,000 or $20,000.  For every illegal alien too?
#####
Please more Andrew!!
#####
Future President YANG.... YES
#####
I love that guy
#####
Yang has a laugh that reveals he enjoys his own talk too much. I had to turn him off.
#####
His response to the rent critique is incredibly lacking. Take somewhere like Seattle or San Francisco where a lot of people moved in and started making a ton of cash. There are full-scale housing crises there now, and rent has gone through the ceiling. The fact of the matter is that landlords set rent at "market prices", which will always increase as people get more money.


Yang is very likeable, I just wish he'd take that meaningful step to the left and advocate a material change to the system.
#####
He's a likeable guy. Shame about his policies -- what is a universal income without serious rent control in tandem? Or better yet, public housing. But I guess this is the US we're talking about.
#####
Yang is the only candidate i've ever donated to the campaign and actually interested in voting for genuinely.
#####
Has anyone sat down with a calculator and ran the MATH on the $1,000 per month for every US citizen over 18 and looked at those numbers?  Just curious if you guys are really doing math these days.
#####
Here's why Andrew Yang is not the best candidate. The problems with Yang's UBI are many, and it does little to solve the huge problem of inequality in society. More importantly, Medicare for All (which Yang does _not_ support), the Fight for $15, and the Green New Deal, are a lot more necessary and go far further to solve problems for the poor & working (low & middle income) people of USA.
#####
I've gotta say - the fact that Jamie Dimon roughly agrees with your plan for dealing with poverty should give you pause. The guy is a fully entrenched in the oligarchy and runs a hugely profitable bank that leaves its working class employees living in penury. 
My fear is that, whether Yang sees this or not, UBI is just a way to preserve and entrench the existing power structures, including the corporate control of government, while keeping the peasants from the gates with a short term pay-off.
The root cause of the country's problems isn't inequality. That is a symptom. The root cause is that the country is bordering on being an oligarchy with a deeply corrupt political system that serves the rich and corporations. UBI won't fix that. In fact it will draw energy away from fixing that.

And the problem with that is that nothing else that is so broken, from climate change to healthcare, will get fixed until the rot at the heart of politics is stopped and reversed.

Only one candidate has a cleared eyed strategy for doing that.
#####
Yang's assertion that the US lost 4 million manufacturing jobs due to automation is seductive, but it's highly contested.
https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/16/both-trade-and-automation-hurt-and-helped-jobs-whi/
Here are three possible causes of manufacturing job losses
1 massive and rapid automation
2 economic conditions leading to collapse in demand
3 corporations taking advantage of cheap wages overseas and increasingly few barriers to using it (China, Mexico, etc) 

Given that 3 is the easiest to happen and we know that the relevant trading conditions are in place, and that it would suit the corporations that generally drive government policy (being easiest and cheapest for them), I think it would be unwise to bet against this being the actual main reason for job losses.

Therefore, with the wrong diagnosis, Yang has hit on the wrong cure.
#####
Andrew is simply the best candidate!  #yang2020!!
#####
I'm sorry. I like Yang in some ways but he lies about Medicare for all in his ads.   He isn't for a public option. He thinks it should be phased in but claims Medicare for all is his platform in his new ad. It's not at all. Bernie is the only good choice with a proven record that can't be debunked. Bernie has a very feasible way to pay for his plans. I like what Yang says about tech, but I'm sick of politicians who lie to get elected then backtrack.
#####
I have chickens and they are almost as smart as my dogs.  They answer when I call and all have different personalities. They feel empathy for each other and guard weaker members of the flock. They recognize and remember (even after long separations) hundreds of different humans and animals. They remember traumatic experiences and avoid the places where they happened.  People want to believe chickens, cows, and pigs are stupid so they don't feel guilty about not caring.  If an animal has a brain, it can suffer.  Some people eat dogs, I'm sure they justify it the same way.  The hard truth is that if you don't pay attention to what you consume, you are complicit in more suffering than you think.

Also, good interview!

So, I imagine that if Katie  believes that that the circumcision of Male is alright for some societies,  female circumcision in others is okay. Libtard.

Beto and Bennett attending a Goldman "small business forum" after being out of the race is suspect, squared.
#####
The fact is that there is a difference between person and object and that's sentiency. Persons have the capacity for consciousness and objects do not and persons have rights and objects have no capacity for them. Therefore, the GOP has no authority to enact laws that infringe on the rights of women in their quest to elevate the status of an object, the fertilized egg, to the status of person. Every god damned anti-abortion law is unconstitutional and should be struck down by every god damned court. The GOP is a far bigger problem than the Democrats, there is no equivalence between the two parties.


Also, Andrew should consider increasing the upper marginal tax rates to 90% again. When they are high, upper earners paid their employees more and invested in the business. When upper margins are low, the wealthy simply take more of the economy for themselves.
#####
I'm a Bernie guy.  The more I hear yang the more I love him.  We need Andrew yang to be part of the dialogue and movement to actually deal with the issues we face.  Thanks Andrew for being one of the few people talking about what's really going on.  Like I said,  I'm a Bernie guy but I'm open minded and I'm all for more Andrew yang and people like him.
#####

#####
You had me at circumcision ...or...er...lack of circumcision. I mean I‚Äôm still for Bernie, but I wanted to say that
#####
I don't know if I'm exactly correct on everything I'm saying but I researched a little and this is my opinion. 

His policies sound good but you have to be even more weary about anything sounding good. What I came to understand is that if Andrew Yang becomes the President of America, he will be the leader through the gateway to a social credit system. 

Andrew wants "Human Centered Capitalism". It's basically Socialism and Socialism doesn't work well with money. At first he says something I agree with. Humans are important than money, which is absolutely right. But then:

"The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar"
 "We need to make the markets serve us rather than the other way around"
"We need government leaders who are truly laser-focused on the public interest above all else and will lead companies to act accordingly"

The upside to his campaign kind of sounds like he wants to get more people more leverage when it comes to jobs. One of the concerns is paying everyone equally. To pay everyone equally, everyone will need to get less money. That really doesn't pan out too well with prices of our necessities increasing every year. Especially when regulators will also be more strict when it comes to a corporations excess profit.
¬† 
¬†¬† What is weird is how he refers to the corporations as if they are horses and regulators having to rein their excesses in. Then says "The government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value". Here I'm guessing the government is the owner of all the ranches. This is good for people who have the same values. However, I don't think that everyone really does. 

¬† "Regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position". That sounds like many corporations can face dramatic changes. Excess money can be used to reinvest into corporations immediately. But with this being a socialist method, the market needs to serve the people. As a result, this can just hurt the corporations. Regulators would need to be at the top of their game all the time. Additionally, they will be blocked out of an opportunity within the private sector. Their relationships with private sectors will become stagnant. 

¬† So now we have to ask how we affected by these regulators. With timebanking, they would be required to be more critical of how they regulate buisness and¬† determining the value of a Time Credit. They would have to make it fair while evaluating the skill set and social value of each person. People getting paid accordingly will be very rough. I assume Time credits won't fully replace curremcy. If this is to become popular people should keep this in mind: will there be FREE classes to ensure that we all have the skills to acquire time credits? On one hand, there won't be any because that takes time. People need to get paid to instruct, vast resources need to be acquired for the facilities usage and space will either need to be rented or constructed. Now let's say the government creates a loophole(cause they're the government), goes with this idea and pays out whatever amount of money to get this done. This has potential because job openings will increase through timebanking. However, there is still a drawback here. If they did that, I'm sure the government would tax us significantly to recoup losses and inevitably create a time credit monopoly. You have to account for a person's ingenuity, transportation, possible relocation for living quarters, etc. Even if people become like minded to make living easier, where would the money come from to support the people if timebanking becomes more prevalent or possibly our stable? 

¬† Andrew's campaign is meant to help out everyone do more than just get by. If people are expected to work multiple positions and are rewarded by meeting social expectations, they will be under pressure. Not only that, but what exactly will be acceptable in terms of social value? If you want to say that humans are more important than money, then you have to keep morale going. If morale is inconsistent, you will definitely have unhappy people. Which can cause inefficiency and lead to termination or people quitting their jobs. Here is where we see the downside of maximizing well being meeting the demand of it's controllers. 

¬† Andrew also believes in the advancement of technology and it's uses. With AI, we can have a system that allows us to see how reliable a person is before trading hours with them. Similar to how the Social Credit System is in China. But with technology advancing, it can easily put people out of jobs. With a "wearable device that monitors your vital signs"¬† that also starts "recommending occasional behavior changes", the world probably wouldn't even need as many doctor's. Which would be unfortunate for those who spent money and put in effort for a medical degree. But this may be untrue and I can possibly be proven wrong.

¬† Speaking of doctors, Andrew says he wants to reform the state of our health care system. He acknowledge's the amount of people who don't have healthcare, the difficulty paying off expenses, the job lock that people face to keep their health care plan and doctors not being able to properly help people. Now with more people being expected to trade hours doing work for credit, you will risk more people getting sick. This results in more doctors being needed; especially if we consider doctors needing to spend more time to give proper care and more people obtaining health a care plan. Better tests, technology and medicine means more resources and more money. So whether there be more or less doctors, they will continue to struggle with proper compensation. Thus, people will continue to struggle with healthcare and may face debt because of it.

¬† Lastly, let's talk about one of Andrew's strongest points: the Guaranteed Income.¬†Yang quotes many people who support this type of thinking. Initially, I did think it was a good idea and many others did as well. He wants to give every American $1,000/mo so they can add flexibility to their living situation. Things may be good for his first year or so but it'll be rough after that. The reason I say that is because it sounds like he somewhat believes in the Free Market Policy. To my understanding, the Free Market Policy allows financial freedom to obtain innovation within a country. However, a country has to cut corners in order to fulfill its objectives. This is the same policy Donald Trump follows during his presidency. With the pressure of more responsibility for the regulators, it will be impossible to advance using that policy without consequences. Enabling welfare throughout the country, starting the use of time banking and tax increases mean living will become more expensive. Resulting in people becoming dependent on welfare and struggling for time credit throughout his term as president. It will become likely that also America will face an economic crash due to it's large demand for resources and it's inability to pay off debt. Effectively making it a third world country.
¬† 
¬† That concludes my take on his policies. I may be wrong about some things but we'll have to see.

Can you IMAGINE the possibilities and how well people in the US could be doing now if we just had the OPPORTUNITY to have the internet at speeds faster than old time original dial up.  ATT and other providers are robbing the consumers blind providing at $50-85. A month for a service only equal to just above dial up.  Our government has paid for internet all over the world including, iraq, Afghanistan, even literally the Antarctic and YET IN RURAL AMERICA, people cannot even get 3G UNLESS you go with a good old co-op that costs more than other services, and as soon as you step outside the area, you can‚Äôt make, receive calls, texts, you have no access to data.  It‚Äôs PATHETIC AND YET companies like AT&T are allowed to continue to rape the consumer and provide no service with NO oversight while receiving lots and lots of subsidies and government welfare that American citizens paying taxes cannot have.  When is anyone going to address how far behind we are.  Trump ran his campaign on how horrible our infrastructure was.  To quote ‚Äúit‚Äôs like a 3rd world country‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo one will want to visit our airports....‚Äù which was all true.  What has he done?  Not one damn thing except give all the money to the wealthiest companies who in turn have made no upgrades, no assistance to the citizens whatsoever.   Yang, Tulsi (who has been completely ostracized) are our best and brightest and NO media will give them the time of day.  Too much money getting laundered to the criminal establishment

I urge anyone: google the VENUS PROJECT. It eliminates a monetary system and puts in its place a RESOURCE-BASED system. It's NOT a utopia, but if used, it can eliminate poverty, scarcity, war, and other global problems & issues. Jacques Fresco worked for almost 70 years on this (Venus Project). Automation doesn't HAVE to displace people if these ideas were put into action. It's called the VENUS PROJECT because it was developed in Venus, Florida (nothing to do with the planet). Please: just take a look. Also related: the ZEITGEIST MOVEMENT.

Yang has a PAC and only offers a public healthcare option. Apart from the UBI, how is he really different than Buttigieg or Biden? A UBI is a great idea, but funding it with a regressive tax is not. I find problems not only in specific parts of his plan, but the overall approach. He's fearmongering about automation and bribing people with a pittance (freedom dividend). We deserve and can have so much more. #Bernie2020
#####
Katie was especially annoying this episode... as was Yang's laugh.


Overall, Yang seems like a decent fellow, but like Warren, his area of focus is far too narrow for a presidential candidate.  I'm glad he's energizing people -- as Bernie did for me in 2015/6 -- but I hope you newly engaged folks stay engaged if/when he drops out.  Most people only pay attention during presidential election years, and our country's massive problems are a direct result of this disengagement.  Stay engaged, especially at your local level, where your energy and participation will have a greater impact.

I'd be onboard if Yang supported m4all. We have to get the profit motive out of health care and stop linking it to our jobs. I don't want my UBI to get sucked up by premiums, deductibles, copays, and prescriptions. I don't want my employer having control over me by keeping me hostage with health insurance.
#####
I'm moderately impressed--a very "real" guy, yes, but no talk of the two biggest issues we face (or are refusing to face): climate chaos, which will likely upset all Yang's great plans, and ending US militarism, which could pay for those plans.

Andrew Yang's compensation from his non-profit Venture for America was $213,979 in 2017 (latest year of published tax filings). Or, a *whopping 6.3%* of the organization's total revenue for that year. This, despite the organization recording a deficit of $ -2,651,496 for the year. What CEO of a major corporation pulls in _anywhere_ near such a percentage of revenue as compensation? What CEO would retain their position, let alone receive such an outrageous percentage of revenue as compensation, if the company has an expense deficit nearly equal to the entirety of the revenue? The man is running a non-profit that had $2.6M in total revenue in 2017, while having $3.6M in employee compensation expenses alone.

Yang is so refreshing as a candidate. I would love to have a data driven, economically minded, business-experienced pragmatic visionary that doesn‚Äôt spew divisive rhetoric in the White House. ¬†

He understands that UBI properly implemented is one of the most effective, efficient, simple, and fair ways to accomplish many of the economic/inequality goals of society, solve many of our problems, and all in a way that truly benefit everyone.¬†

It would have huge effects on entrepreneurship, poverty, homelessness, prisoner rehabilitation, abused women, sex trade, abortions, unions, upward mobility, charities, marriage, health, mental health, IQ, crime, violence, homicides, suicide, education rates, LGBT community, job lock, dynamism, overall economy, bureaucratic waste, etc. It would help create exactly the type of system that everyone could thrive in.

The fact that Yang has got this far on a "shoestring" budget, should demonstrate to people that Yang is extremely efficient and effective. Yang can do more with less. Exactly what people want from a leader in government. People don't want their tax money wasted foolishly and Yang will give the people the best bang for their buck. The government of politicians wastes about 30% of the money, so (efficient) Yang will even reclaim much of that wasted money by doing a little house cleaning once he is President.
Yang is the brilliant visionary leader I always envisioned, but never thought I would see in the US. It's up to the people to see what they have right in front of them. Don't let a once in a life time President slip away. Yang's personality type is very rare. Yang himself is a very healthy version of his personality type and he is exceptionally intelligent for his type, even though his type is called "the Mastermind". My point is that Yang is even more than a once in a life time leader. Lincoln, JFK and MLK jr were all the same rare type as Yang and I think Yang is even smarter than they were. Yang is in the top 0.1 percentile. That is super genius. Yet Yang is still very humble. Yang is very brave, because the powers that be do not like his type. They know that there is only one way to stop them, when once they have the power of the people behind them. Yang can most certainly get the power of the people behind him. I just hope that the security is much better now.

Did y'all see this?  Not a scientific poll, but the Tulsa World is in one of the deepest of red states and only one vote was allowed per device.

Look at the views on the two videos they have with yang in the title compared to all there other views. 25k views here while all there others average like 1k views up to 14k for Pete but yang has one at 25k and 35k views
#####
Wow. Even showtime is giving Yang his justified screen time! Kudos!
#####
Yang Gang Baby!!!
#####
He definitely can.  You can see that all over Youtube comments.  If all those Trump voters who like Yang actually vote for Yang in the Dem primary (after re-registering as Dems for the purpose) there might be a Yang landslide to get the Dem nomination.
#####
Like this comment if you have never donated or voted for anyone. This is my first time to actually care about politics thanks to Andrew.
#####
....and then when the actual show finally streamed, they didn‚Äôt even edit in a clip of his Iowa speech, which was without a doubt one of the most compelling of the evening!They lingered on Mayor Pete and went straight to Warren after Biden. 
So, the producers and most likely, these pundits have their narrative and Andrew Yang is just a novelty to them, regardless of what they see on the ground. The skin of the DC bubble isn‚Äôt as thin as Donald Trump‚Äôs.  The off handed ‚Äúhe‚Äôll never be the nominee‚Äù, remarks made by the DC pundit class only serves to feed their narrative, which they, in turn, perpetuate among themselves like some incestuous mutant that is getting attention because it is , in fact, a mutation of reality that they have cobbled together using 20th century methods of polling and data gathering. There are far better and more detailed and accurate ways to read the data and get results.  Cambridge Analytica proved every major poll wrong in 2016.  The small sampling size and methods of the major polling outfits are statistically missing large swaths of voters that do not fall under the glow of their very narrow spotlight.  However, that skewed data is used to drive the MSM narrative. If one only watches MSNBC, FOX, CNN or any of the major networks, it seems like an alternate reality to those of us who use the internet and intellectual curiosity to check our own bias and nurture our objectivity with truth and facts. The regurgitated tropes become mind numbing while leading the tribalists  to their comfortable news bubbles where they can be fed more of their world view and ignore realities that could possibly run counter to their preferred beliefs. That would be uncomfortable. These shows need to be seen and watched for what they actually are: entertainment that has an agenda. And it certainly ain‚Äôt journalism!  Push the status quo that will keep the powerful in power. Job one. Mission accomplished.

0:06 just a coincidence not a perv!

#yangmediashoutout Alex -you need to excercise some critical thinking. Please do your research and make sure you wear a tie... Ask the right questions. I am loosing my humanity first listening to this...
#####
Yang is straight forward!!!
#####
Compare this video‚Äôs view count to the rest of this channel‚Äôs uploads. Andrew Yang is a huge draw. Nobody can excite the electorate more than this man, and the amount of views/clicks he generates is a product of that. People are beginning to pay attention, and we are only just beginning. #YangGang #YangBeatsTrump
#####
You need to give him more coverage, he‚Äôs not a fringe candidate & shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed.
Yang has real data driven policy ideas, with straight talk, no platitudes, rhetoric or identity politics.

Andrew Yang left them speechless!!

She just got YANGED by Yang himself! üòéüòÄüòé
#####
The way that she looks at him with such hope at 1:50 üòÅ
#####
He already did
#####
We're about to pour gasoline on fire!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
This is about to be #1 viewed video on their channel. Hint, hint. #YangRising #HumanityFirst #YangGang
#####
She seemed stunned by his confidence. lol
#####
The problem is he is also peeling off Bernie voters - but he won't be able to peel off enough votes from Bernie to win the primary.  He will peel off enough for a centrist Democrat to win.
#####
I feel like he was sent here from the future to save us from ourselves. Yang 2020!
#####
I1m glad that this interview happened. The aired episode spent too short a time on Yang.
#####
She looks like she is smitten!!!
#####
A moment in the history making for the whole world.
#####
You make a good video about Yang, it‚Äôs gonna get a shit ton of views, likes, subscribers and shares.  The Yang Gang is obsessed and can‚Äôt get enough of this guy!
#####
What doubts do you have Andrew?

Uhhhh none. üíØ

Her face at the end. Her face said it all.

A.Y. is on the cover of the most current issue of Newsweek from 11/7-11/14!

I heard someone brough up a great idea:

Buy a few copies of that and drops them at doctors/dentists/clinics/hospitals office waiting rooms, as well as any other spaces such as the waiting area of car service/repair stations/ car wash waiting area/ you can think of where there is a magazine rack and Yang can get exposure just from his face on the cover of Newsweek!
The cheapest and most non-intrusive way of helping Yang getting extra exposure for those who has not yet heard of him!

A few copies of Newsweek is a Small investment for someone wanting to help out spreading Yang' s message, but may bring big rewards for the campaign!

this alex wagner person is everything that is wrong with mainstream media. she comes off really uneducated and frankly very condescending. ew. how does she have a platform at all?
#####
Pour Gas on the Fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YangMentum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Whenever he says he's one of two candidates, or one of the only candidates, that Trump supporters would vote for, he should also highlight the other candidate if he's trying to do what's best for the country.  Avoiding this means you're trying to win more than assist the people in electing the best person for the job.  This also gives credence to the idea that his first public ad being about medicare for all, or some attempt at it while using the same name, is strategically geared towards peeling away support from that other candidate, Bernie, that Trump voters would vote for.  That's as politician as it gets.

He says he thinks 100% he will be the nominee.  Pride before the fall.

Full disclosure: None of the current candidates including Bernie have earned my vote.
#####
He's against  med 4 all  and for a vat tax He should  drop out
#####
I wish he'd been shown more in the actual episode. But thank you for giving him some more exposure.
#####
Andrew Yang for President
#####
Ain‚Äôt seen nothin yet üòé

#yanggang - humanity first!

The DNC can either die a fast death with the likes of Warren, Sanders and Biden (Clinton, Harris) or it can experience rejuvenation and rebirth with Yang, Williamson and Gabbard. #BoomersforYang

I would like to know if this was filmed after or before the ep with Trevor Noah. Did she become curious after Noah's comments, or did she film this with Yang first and was dismissive of Yang with Noah?
#####
#yanggang
#####
Yang is definitely on point. But he needs to have a plan to eventually get rid of those insidious health ins. cos.  Medicare for All has to be his ultimate goal.  Ins cos made over $20 billion in profits last yr.
#####
Awesome. Yang FTW! He will be one of the last standing. Once that happens, he has the moment he needs
#####
More Yang please!!!
#####
Left her speechless lol

Who else sees the spark between these two.
#####
It's gonna be some fire.   ~yAnG2o2o~
#####
Alex Wagner has very beautiful eyes.
#####
Thank you for the interview! #YangMediaShoutout
#####
Yang has the best chance of winning simply because he is not a politician and you cant find dirt on him except to attack his policies which are pretty much bullet proof so yah I don't see how anyone can beat this guy he's got the upper hand #YangGang
#####
Yang is the presidential candidate America needs to elect! He's the right person at this time!
#####
1:49 lol what is that death-stare?
#####
I was for Warren until I did some research on this guy.  He talks like a leader..Warren sounds confrontational and mean af.
#####
Not
#####
By the end of this conversation, she was wetter than an otter's pocket
#####
Andrew Yang is the best candidate in 2020.
#####
I'm from another country, and all I want to say is dont let this guy lose this election. He is what the country needs most right now.
#####
I'm from Iowa, I'd vote for this Yang guy --

MSNBC is fake new when you do not apologize for making many mistakes - 15 times you left Andrew Yang out of graphics. MSNBCMediaBlackout not free or fair elections!¬† You are worse than Putin.

Give yang more coverage
#####
if Andrew Yang didn‚Äôt win democratic nominee , So I blame Media, because of  MSNBC we must support Yang2020  or Trump 2020.
#####
Msnbc got punked!!!!!!!!
#####
I hope in the next debate they ask Warren, Biden, Sanders, etc why they feel they are qualified and equipped to handle the true threats of tomorrow...
#####
I like Yang, but he is wrong to defend the philanthropy of a Billionaire.  It is insignificant to them and probably a tax write off.  Billionaires are greedy hoarders not philanthropists and job creators.
#####
Basically, MSNBC, you're meddling in our elections by shutting out candidates you dont like.  Very un-American of you.
#####
All he wants is an apology, MSNBC
#####
MSNBC - Oligarch / Pro-War Propaganda #MSNBCfearsYang

The power in that response and the fact that Tom pivots and listens to him, why, because Andrew defended another candidates position. This man will bring everyone together.
#####
Yang is onto something, if our enemy shoots down one of our jets over their seas, Americans won't blink an eye.  But if our enemy hacks into our satellite and shuts off the Internet and YouTube, we would all go insane.
#####
If we get it right this time, it will be Pres. Yang!
#####
Fake news MSNBC at it again

After watching the entire debate, I have to say, shame on you MSNBC. You are the reason why we will nvr have a true leader who cares for the Americans. You are bought by the rich and powerful. Shame on you.

Hey MSNBC, they way you treat Bernie and Yang will not be forgotten. Boomers will die off and the only people left will be the ones you alienated and don‚Äôt trust you as a result.
#####
This network is definitely racist towards Asians
#####
MSNBC if you want go fix how you have blacked out both Yang and Tulsi, do some long interviews with REAL questions and please, not about Trump!
#####
When you promise to give everyone $1000 a month free money...and still can't break through....you should just  give up. Yang should wear a Santa suit .

Andrew Yang has 6 Mina speaking time and Elizabeth Warren has 13 minutes.  What is wrong with MSNBC  ? This channel is going down. It is getting so bad and ridiculous.  Boycott this channel

Thats fantastic, because the true threats of tomorrow are obviously evil corporate news organizations such as MSNBC and Fox.
#####
Let yang speak

America loves Andrew Yang
#####
Andrew Yang: It's not left, not right, forward!!!

Media: *What does forward mean?*
#####
Lol 2 days later and Bloomberg tic tok is making better news than you all. #comingforyouradvertisers #comcastsucks
#####
I've been around long enough to have seen this media behavior before.

Ross Perot was ridiculed by main stream media. That ‚Äúgiant sucking sound‚Äù he talked about? We may not have heard it, but America certainly felt it.

Gary Johnson was honest, intelligent, and successful in business and government. He was written off as a dumb pot head. 

The two-party duopoly and main stream media keep feeding us candidates they like. Why do they like them? Maybe because, for better or worse, their candidates provide plenty of fodder for media attention. The Presidential election ends up being a sort of national entertainment, instead of a job interview.

Meanwhile, the federal deficit and the other big issues of the day are not being addressed in a thoughtful manner. Emotional rhetoric and unrealistic promises aren‚Äôt going to fix a thing. 

The boomers are retiring. They won‚Äôt be paying federal tax through their paychecks anymore. They will be using up Medicare resources instead. Meanwhile, we‚Äôve saddled younger generations with a federal deficit that is beyond comprehension in size. Does anyone remember that the Soviet Union, once a world power, crumbled under the weight its debt?

Andrew Yang seems to be the only candidate who has some sense of math, money, and how to create jobs. Once again, the parties and the media are conspiring to shut him down.

Although I am not a member of any party, and I certainly don‚Äôt want party mail, calls, or other nuisances, I was thinking about registering as Democrat, just so I could vote in the primary. 

What if everybody who supports Yang, or who just wants to disrupt the current system, voted for Yang in the Democratic primary? (And then changed affiliation asap afterwards.) Could we get Yang on the ticket? Are there enough of us to do that?
#####
So terrorism is not a "real threat" in the 21st century...?!
#####
Stop snubbing Andrew Yang MSNBC. #letyangspeak
#####
MSNBC should be ashamed of interfering with the integrity of american democracy
#####
Extremely disappointed in MSNBC's highly unprofessional, really, criminally biased "moderation". It is unclear who has the most unapologetic and patently absurd propaganda - North Korea or MSNBC. Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves. Andrew Yang deserved better.
#####
Notice MSNBC put a red background behind the 3 candidates they dislike.
Red has nothing but negative connotations for boomer democrats. 

Communism. GOP. Blood.
#####
Wait, "climate change"???  If his focus is climate change, why is his website 90% about getting $1000/mo?
#####
To Vote for Andrew Yang Vote 1$ to Yang2020.com and WE will make OUR president make #HumanityFirst

üëáüèºMake this blue to spread the word!
#####
MSNBC: For those who wants to know why we are making sure Yang doesn't get any coverage, this is why. If Yang is the president, even our corrupt and biased journalists will be replaced by neutral AI robots that report real news. We can't let that happen!!
#####
MSNBC sucks. But Yang for president!
#####
Why MSNBC! Why do you hate Yang!
#####
Never having anything to do with NBC after this outright bias against Yang.  They are worse than Fox.  Evil.
#####
Yang was the best part of the debate
#####
Andrew Yang: "This is NOT just my idea. From Thomas Paine to Martin Luthor King, Universal Basic Income has been the baton that others have been wanting to pass along in this marathon of human progress. And I want to be the one that takes it to the finish line."
#####
#MSNBCfearsYang

MSNBC was terrible at moderating!! I'm just saying,  from Canada. Other countries can see  all this happening with your media blackout on him, whether it's intentional or not, it's bloody obvious! It's absolutely foolish to not let this man talk! He benefits the rest of the world as well!!
#####
Yay!!!!! Andrew Yang! Love that guy!
#####
RePete is copying everything Andrew said, studying it and deciphering it to find out how he can say it in his next speaking engagement.
#####
This is the Washington Post + MSNBC moderated debate. Washington Post is owned in whole by Jeff Bezo (Amazon CEO). Andrew was using Amazon as the target in his campaign. Therefore, the debate moderators giving Andrew the least time serves as a form of retribution for calling out Jeff's company. You can clearly see the conflict of interest at play in American politics.
#####
Andrew Yang is the only candidate who can bring everyone together from every age, race and gender.
#####
Andrew Yang's opponents are Putin and MSNBC, not his fellow democratic presidential candidates.
#####
#Yang2020 #MSNBCFearsYang

Trump, Session, and Miller has to be punished for their hate, racism, greed, deaths of those innocent asylum seeking, immigrating, refugee children. They must PAY with their freedoms or lives.

#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Yang has the best ideas and solutions but gets the least amount of talk time - should be the opposite. Support this man so main stream media will have no choice but to pay more attention.

The DNC should have a tie requirement to be on the debate stage. This is getting ridiculous.

Great answer
#####
MSNBC is a scummy propaganda outlet. Whomever they push as the anointed one is a snake.
#####
I wonderful moment from Andrew to give Steyer credit for using his own money to fight Climate Change and a great response from him that shows he's ready to take on the threats of the 21st century.  Well said!
#####
A  genius. if only this network would stop holding him back...
#####
MSNBC your debate was ridiculously unfair. No wonder no one trusts you for news anymore.
#####
Even though they tossed him all of the wonkiest, smeary questions, Yang knocked it out of the park. He also had the least speaking time despite polling 6th and higher nationally. #yang2020
#####
all the other pete, warren bernie, and bieden don't know how to handle
#####
Tulsi POTUS, Andrew VP

Watch Trump and Pence go head to head with that!
#####
All racial prejudice is poison to any modern society...that being said, both Yang and Gabbard have also spoken out against "identity politics" elsewhere, a sentiment which I tend to lean towards as well. Some people on the left have become too unbalanced, maybe in some ways nearly as much as the right...not everyone who believes themselves to be an oppressed victim actually is one.
#####
Yang for 2020, he is very intelligent..i want to believe him, he is the real revolution.
#####
Tulsi is best choice
#####
Tulsi/Yang for 2 terms and then Yang/Tulsi for another 2 terms!üôåüèª
#####
Please vote Yang. Biden, Warren are funded by big corporations and will not care about the poor.  Look at their debates,  they have no real substance,  depth but only political rhetoric from the past. Can't you all see it like I do? It  is so obvious they have no ideas how to help the average Americans. Vote Yang and our children will have a brighter future. üôÇüòÄ
#####
I am glad to see Yang get some air time by MSNBC. Yang is real but MSNBC integrity have been compromised = fake news.
#####
I wonder what's more dangerous, white supremacy, or a Chinese American president who is a Chinese supremacist. I wonder what that would look like. Having been a white minority for 30 years in the state of Hawaii, I have a pretty good idea
#####
Just exactly what examples of white supremacist terror is Yang talking about? Is it anything like the black lives matter endorsed targeting and murder of white policemen , or is it more like the cowardly black clad and masked antifa pukes who destroy and attack anything and anyone that is traditionally conservative. Is there any plan to include these groups and their activities under the umbrella of " Domestic Terrorism"  or are we just adding it to the list of sins that are exclusively white? Please continue with your racist ,divisive propaganda . Every time you speak you  convince me  you lack what it takes to lead and unite a country and those yet undecided , one more reason to disregard you. What a pitiful lot.
#####
MSNBC is fake new when you do not apologize for making many mistakes - 15 times you left Andrew Yang out of graphics. MSNBCMediaBlackout not free or fair elections!¬† You are worse than Putin.

tulsia and yang should  never be in politics,both are far rightwing corporatist libertarian nationalists.
#####
Yang and Tulsi have the potential to be the JFKs of today, but the media doesn't want them to win
#####
Yang yanged the entire audience in 10 seconds.
#####
MSNBC censors Yang, even going as far as removing him from the polls and calling him ‚ÄúJOHN yang‚Äù because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to get his name right.
#####
Gabbard and Yang would make a formidable duo as POTUS and VP. I fear this will not be allowed to happen because too many powerful benefactors to the DNC and the elites in charge of the whole set-up would stand to lose. Everyone in the world should be talking about these two pioneers in an otherwise corrupt, bought and paid for system that will recycle the same rhetoric and deliver the same miserable results at the expense of the taxpayer whose dollars they are funneling into the corporate coffers that elected them in the first place.
#####
Its Sooo Obvious Yang/Tulsi 2020 is the Dream Team! YANG FOR THE ECONOMY AND TULSI FOR FOREIGN POLICY
#####
Yang's answer was phenomenal!
#####
Hey Yang, make sure you include BLM and Antifa in that group as well, but, you wont because they serve your purpose of destroying the very foundation of America.
#####

Did Yang just try and say that gun violence is primarily young white men? LoL This is why we don't need Democrats.

So basically hopeless whites are hateful whites? But plenty of people are hopeless, we still don't go out and shoot 45 people at a school church or mall...

White supremacist terrorism is already designated as domestic terrorism.

TO LATE TULSI     TRUMP HAS ALREADY STARTED TO REFORM THE CLINTON'S AND DEMONCRAPS WAR ON MINORITIES AND DRUGS

Don't ignore Yang!!! Yang2020!!!
#####
#BoycottMSNBC 
Byron Allen, 50 cent & Diddy agree!
The only videos MSNBC will show you of Yang & Tulsi are smears, or controversy.
#####
In the real poll
It's yang sanders and Tulsi in the lead.
The polls published by the media is false propaganda.
#####
What I love about Yang is that he's a true advocate for the people. He talks to people and has them tell him their stories. He looks at the culmination of these experiences and tried to figure out a solution that would benefit everyone. I think the freedom dividend is a fantastic idea for America and could help usher us into a new golden age.
#####
Tulsi gabbard is only pretending to believe that racism and white supremacy is a huge issue because she knows if she doesn't pretend that it is a huge issue deliberation Democrats won't vote for her anyone with a half a brain knows that although racism is existent in the United States and it is bad it is the least concern and has the least negative impact on black people's lives systemic racism would not even make the top 50 list on why there are so many black people in prison and y they make less money then other races and have more kids out of wedlock

By ‚Äú criminal justice reform‚Äù they just mean legalize  marijuana.   Good bye Tulsi
#####
Yang has the right solutions but that's not what the elites want. They would rather see the guillotines fall.
#####
MSNBC GOING DOWN THE DRAIN
#####
Tulsi is what is needed - if she (or anyone else for that matter) decides to adopt UBI, it will make Yang superfluous.
#####
There is common sentiment among republicans that if Yang(and maybe Tulsi) don't get the democratic pick, they will vote Trump. 

Admittedly, as much as I hate Trump, if Warren wins the democratic nomination, I might be tempted to vote Trump. I dislike her THAT much.

Biden, and Warren are terrible choices and it's disappointing to see them polling so high. I can't believe how Biden is polling so high with black voters. Frankly, It's embarrassing to think black citizens are going to vote for a guy who says rubbish like "poor kids are just as smart as white kids" Bernie is good, although his ideas need some 21st century updating. Yang is better in that department.
 
But really, this is all a prevalent idea that the people WANT an honest anti-establishment leader. That's why, for better for worse, and despite failing to deliver, Trump won last election. Nobody saw it coming. But the polls they say! The polls are BS. They rely heavily on phone polling which is dominated by old folks. I really hope Yang, whose internet support  is greatly underestimated, will mimic the same rise as Trump. And he will actually deliver.
#####
The supremacist mentality is worse in Australia. If you're not white in some parts of the country, you're the 'others'.
#####
Andrew Yang: *popular on the internet*

Media: *aight let's make sure that he'll stay silent*
#####
These two are who I want to see vs Trump in a debate
#####
M S N B C, hands off our democracy. #MSNBCfearsYANG
#####
Shame on MSNBC for only giving Yang 6 mins to speak and yet he is still the most popular candidate
#####
Each canidate has very good points that also identify strenghts, and weakness in our current system. And the more complex question for me is can a two party system ever break the cycle of division which ultimatly  stagnates any change for the elected majority.
#####
Tulsi and Yang are the only Dems I would vote for. There is something very genuine about them as opposed to the other candidates.
#####
Tulsi sounds like an AI robot
#####
yeah that's the problem that is killing thousands in our cities.  whites.  dems are delusional.  2020 election will be 2016 redux.

That's no way to treat and host a presidential candidate.  Never liked Jimmy Kimmel, now I dislike him even more.
#####
Screw Jimmy
#####
I'm Asian n like Yang but I don't think jimmy s jokes r so offensive.
Are they?
#####
Jimmy clearly has an agenda of his own what the hell is he doing?
#####
I somehow like the ignorant and biased interviews the best. It showcases how composed and well tempered Andrew is.
#####
Wtf Jimmy?! Why are you being so condescending towards Yang and his run for POTUS dude? Smh
#####
Kimmel is outrageously stupid! What an unclassy way of interviewing mr Yang
#####
This is why no one can touch Conan O'Brien.
#####
What the hell I wrong with this Kimmel guy!
Is he being played by his superiors like a puppet!
#####
Normal scorpio behavior, hilary is a scorpio also
#####
Relevance, intelligence, innovativeness, humaneness is what all of American needs right now to do exactly what Yang is describing - it's coming, how can we ALL participate, benefit, and further innovation for the greater good.¬† No old white guy can know of that nor lead America through that process - and I'm talking Senate as well as Presidency.
#####

I used to really like you Jimmy. Now I just find you incredibly intolerable. Just blatantly rude, nothing you said was funny.

Jimmy Kimmel literally tried to divert the conversation toward stupid subjects... just wow.
#####
Just unsubscribed.
#####
To this day ted Cruz is still ducking. What a pussy.
#####
Jimmy says Americans play video games, when in reality they work three jobs( part time) because Corps don‚Äôt like full time). Americans have high mortgages and high student loans to pay. And new unskilled immigrants put out of jobs low skilled Americans( this is a real issue ignored). Other phenomena that‚Äôs happened American workers are replaced with new visa workers that get paid less. Instead that corporations to compete for best workers or to train them, they go out globally and flood America with low paid foreigners, to avoid paying Americans with living wages and benefits. What Americans have to do now, to foreclose their homes and to file for bankruptcy? And I don‚Äôt know why Jimmy thinks he is great, and relevant for his opinion ?

Elon may not be US citizen but he has built businesses in US and created jobs in US. Apple is an American company but a lot of it's profits are stashed in Ireland to avoid paying American taxes. Apple and any company that puts profits over America (Amazon with $0 in 2018 taxes) should be labeled as traitors to this country.

F*ck Jimmy Kimmel.
#####
I used to rate kimmel higher than most other current hosts (except of course conan), because hes a genuine comedian and at times shows pretty quick wit. But lately hes shown an arrogant, close minded side where he treats his guests with a lack of respect. You saw it in the joaquin phoenix interview as well. He comes as across as a meaner jimmy fallon - and I DONT like jimmy fallon. For all colberts and meyers flaws, yang is much more of a guest suited to them, and they handled it much much better.
#####

Only colored candidate?' Dumbest thing I've heard. All of those "white" candidates are mutts. I betchu they have black, or asian blood running through their veins.
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the Democratic Primaries. That's the ONLY way he's going to get on the ticket. 



In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

I would've said it's a disappointment that my skin color actually matters to you people(Dems). Why do the democrats care about race and ethnicity so much? We should be above that, that crap divides, only our nationality shall unite us one, as Americans üá∫üá∏
#####
Andrew Yang is hero in every sense of the word! The YangGang is taking action to bring the wave crashing down on Washington DC. We are working tirelessly for him to win by a landslide!
#####
The word color itself sounds really racist, it sounds like everyone besides the white people are all given a tag.
#####
Yang's UBI is a Trojan Horse that is funded by looting the social safety net by 80% and a regressive tax and furthers wealth inequality.

He's not for a Living wage for full-time workers, Higher Education and Healthcare as a Human Right, student and medical debt cancellation, or a Federal Jobs Guarentee.
#####

I‚Äôm a millennial, he‚Äôs got my vote. Not because of his ethnicity. But the problems he is exposing directly to the core.
#####
I am still thinking about it and considering all of my options. However, Andrew Yang is the only candidate that I am feeling.
#####
Yo I swear I hate how the Democrats try to guilt trip us into liking black candidates yang is the only poc because he's a better candidate than Cory or Kamala could ever be. That's not a pic issue that's a they suck as candidates.
#####
Just donated to him.
#####
Asians have way more money in America than whites, which he chose to leave out. I'll be voting for him but the wealth gap is not racial.
#####
This is by far the best answer to this question.  He focused on the black/hispanic as they are the biggest minority groups.  He spoke with numbers and talked about having "disposal income" to contribute to a political party.  He answered the question with a "solution" of his universal income plan for all Americans.  How brilliant!
#####
"People would vastly prefer 1,000 instead of the hodge podge of current benefits." 
BULLSHIT
If you are a young single mother in public housing and Yang yanks that and gives the woman a grand instead, good luck finding an apartment for that amount as most apartments require income requirements which this young mom will certainly not meet.  Then the thousand she gets will be subject to inflation.  Yang claiming it won't is such utter bullshit.  You can't pump the kind of cash he wants to into the economy and not have considerable inflation which will hit said section 8 mother hardest. 
There will be more inflation with Yang's proposals because if there's not you will go to market with your grand and see increasingly empty shelves. Costs will have to go up to regulate supply. 
Yang's proposals increase the wealth gap between the needy and everyone else. For those already getting public benefits somewhere around a grand a month the income gap between this person and everyone else is increased because everyone else is now getting that grand to via Yang's UBI, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't above mentioned inflation. UBI is little more than a harsh austerity program deceivingly wrapped up like a monthly Christmas gift for the poor.  That it is endorsed like by the likes of Milton Friedman and Co. only further illustrates my point.
Yang's assertion that he is going to cut everyone a freedom (hardly) dividend and not have a bureaucracy oversee this program is also ludicrous. 
Further attesting to how unthought out this is on Yang's part a $1 is not a $1 is not a $1.  Where I live in Florida my dollar goes considerably farther than it does in New York or California where things cost more and yer Yang hands out the same grand to everybody.  He over-states the problem of automation, trivializes the importance of work (yes even a shit job is more meaningful and conducive to mental health than Yang's UBI.  To the extent automation is gettong out of hand, well like the blacks on the Breakfast Club who seemed quite dismissive (and for good reason of Andrew) " can't we just stop building the robots??"  Well, ... Can't we??
#####
I would vote for Yang even without the Freedom Dividend. This man is exactly what America needs right now.
#####
Always the best answers from Yang
#####
Yang is what America needs. Not left, not right, forward!
#####
His answer should have been that in America, we don‚Äôt see people for their color.  He remains on the stage because people saw his ideas and liked them.  Why is he the only person of color remaining?  Because he‚Äôs the only person of color who isn‚Äôt a leftist. It always amazes me that it‚Äôs constantly noted there are no candidates of color now, but in 2008 and 2012 the nominee was a person of color.  Why won‚Äôt they examine that fact for what it is, evidence that people supported Obama because they liked him, and disdained Booker and Harris because they‚Äôre extremists.  It‚Äôs also quite ironic to constantly note any circumstance which lacks people of color when you purport to be champions of rooting out racism.  Truly racist people always see people for what color they are and fixate on it regularly.  Sound familiar?
#####

Thumbs up Yang. Down for LAT. All the media love asking this question, exacerbating the whole race issue they apparently want to not be an issue in the first place. The media can help the diversity "issue" by not drawing attention to it. The character content is what matters, not skin color.

Andrew, you are a son of immigrants, so are all the White in America !  ~97% of Americans are immigrants. Only the Red Indians are the natives of America. White Americans, study your American History, it is really short and simple. Also study how your forefathers engaged in Transatlantic African Salvery Trade. Do a serious statistical research on how many bombs American soldiers have dropped  onto foreign lands or how  many wars were initiated by America  after WW II. It's time for introspection.  It is euphemism to say America has a Defence  Industry because it operationally has an Attack  Industry. This is the 21st century. America's  excessive expenditure on Attack Industry, meddling in other countries' domestic affairs,  arrogance, ignorance,  bigotry and prejudice are  America's real enemies, not China or Russia.

He turned his answer to make it about all POC, not just about Asians. It drives me crazy when politicians of color only make it about their own. What about the rest? America is about unity and that‚Äôs what Yang is pushing forward. No ones left behind.

within  seconds is incredible.


How many political candidates could do this ?


"And even though overall racial and ethnic inequality in wealth narrowed from 2013 to 2016, the gap remains large. In 2016, the median wealth of white households was $171,000. That‚Äôs 10 times the wealth of black households ($17,100) ‚Äì a larger gap than in 2007 ‚Äì and eight times that of Hispanic households ($20,600), about the same gap as in 2007.

I love how all the white candidates looked down when the question came up. They know the big picture that he‚Äôs talking about.

Identity politics leftist are going down the wrong path with identity politics I hope everyone can agree

Sadly with the lack of wisdom and education,  most Americans will only waste the $1000 dividend and it wont be of any benefit. 

Its the same principle as giving a fish or teaching you how to catch a fish. 

Giving free moneh away doesnt help the poor

Asian people are smart nice well mannered and full of compassion it‚Äôs time for an Asian person to be the President of the United States and make AMERICA SMARTER AGAIN. I‚Äôm so sick of these OLD white knights they are too OLD school and their brains never develop. Andrew Is the revolution for this country. let me ask you haters this question how are we supposed to improve this country if we are still following OLD laws OLD amendments and OLD constitutional rights that has been built since 1700???

Amna from PBS specifically asks how Yang feels to be the "Only person of color...," then on the PBS NewsHour Judy says _Andrew Yang brought up the fact_ that he's the "Only person of color" - Media SJW's

Yang is an incredible leader.  His integrity, brilliance, and compassion really shine through.  Amazing to see him inspire and bring together such a diverse cool crowd of youth and professionals, etc.  Love the way Yang is using social media -- from live streams on Twitch -- to YouTube teams such as the Zach and Matt Show -- to a POP UP!  Brilliant!  It is also paramount that our next President understand technology.  Yang's expertise is undeniable -- and towers above any of the other candidates.  I encourage everyone to try to help donate to Yang's campaign.  Any amount helps.  I made my first campaign contribution ever last week to Yang.  Yang's policies are common sense based, realistic, and powerful.  We need a President with integrity and respect -- and one that can lead with compassion.  This groundswell of support that has been created around him is amazing!

well spoken dude around 8 minutes in, helped me understand the media blackout situation a bit more

Sit back and watch a fast your channels go to shit when you expose your political views.  Liberal media and Hollywood have these people brainwashed. It sad the see the amount of human beings so weak minded. Just a bunch of major city mascots for the Democratic Party.

Just sit outside the churches and food banks and wait for handouts and free rides. All want something for flipping nothing and use whatever topics liberal media throws around as an excuse to act as dumb as humanly possible to inspire what now? All I see is liberal trash.

If you pay attention. You will notice most of the people here like to do their own researches. Which makes sense. They like to look into the same thing from different sources. Where as a trump supporter doesn‚Äôt do any researches and just go with their gut and only believe what Trump says.

love this video and Love that yang armory movement!
#####
here's a BLOOMBERG QUOTE "An introduction of a 5 percent¬†VAT, with a broad base which¬†would¬†cover about two-thirds of household consumption,¬†would increase¬†federal revenues by almost $3 trillion from 2020 through 2028, according to the CBO." so here's a small 5% vat tax will generate less than 375 billion a year for the next 8 years. ALL OF YOU CLAIMING YANGS VAT TAX WILL COVER THE 3 TRILLION A YEAR PRICE TAG, YOURE WRONG AND YOULL STILL BE ABOUT 2.625 TRILLION DOLLARS SHORT!!!!! So we now know yangs policy is one big lie. At least in terms of how it's going to be paid for. Plus! Products will cost 5 percent more. Man this policy is a disaster. No wonder why no1 can give me facts And numbers to explain... Because it's impossible and I just PROVED that! STOP BEING FOOLED PEOPLE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. I JUST PROVED THIS AS ANOTHER LIE FROM THE LEFT. THESE PEOPLE CANT TELL THE TRUTH IF OUR COUNTRY DEPENDED ON IT AND PEOPLE WANT THEM RUNNING OUR COUNTRY?! Crazies

Vote people. Awesome that Adam is putting this content up but we have to vote. Less than 50% of young people between 18 and 30 vote. That means half the people standing is this line may not even vote. Imagine if we increased the voter turnout to even just 60%. The young people would decide every election. We have the power. Use it.

The support of Yang from Donald Glover is so massive. The man made the massive hit of This Is America, a very politically attentive song, and for people to see someone with the platform of Childish Gambino support Yang, it‚Äôll bring a ton of eyes.

Seems like he has alot of support from the homeless, jobless, and a bunch of entitled dumbasses. A bunch of lost, braindead infants.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
Thanks, Carly.  How could I help??? I already donated.  When is Yang stopping by Wisconsin?
#####
For someone who fired a women "because she got married", he is a nice guy
#####
this is great !
#####
I met Carly at an event today. Chatted for a bit. She‚Äôs no joke!  Super impressive, and very cool to boot.  Hope to see you again Carly!

Yang needs to fill arenas not town hall rooms. Your Fired.

Wait someone explain what's up with the Bloomberg card at the end
#####
Lol ooook
#####
No Yang. Lies about support for Medicare for All. Isn't for canceling all student debt, isn't for a living wage, won't fight for anything. No no no. Full of phonyness. Bernie all day!
#####
Time for Yang to bow out
#####
Carly Reilly, Gran respeto a usted chingona!  Yang 2020! (Tulsi Gabbard would make a very potent vice president)
#####
The most expensive is real estate industry. Andrew yang's zoning law policy can help low income family to self build home and liberate from city high house rental and high house prices.
#####
Policy change zoning law based on home ownership for all American poverty people is very important than money donation and Medicare. The most expensive is real estate market. Many people are because of low salary can't pay off high house rental and can't satisfy high life fee to cause homelessness.
#####
He can win to depend on policy change zoning law for all American poverty people and low income family and low salary people's group.
#####
UBI is feminist?  If it is then it would exclude men so it cannot be feminist.  So her initial tweet was wrong.
#####
She's amazing!!!!!!
#####
Flop campaign. Not gonna go anywhere. Stop wasting people's money.
#####
He has no chance in 2020. Zero. He‚Äôs like a Zebra in a crocodile infested swamp. 

He‚Äôs a nice guy with good intentions but he lost my vote when he was asked how he‚Äôd deal with Noko and he answered ‚ÄúI‚Äôd call up Noko and say Hey let‚Äôs work something out.‚Äù LOLS!!! okay there bud.
#####
10.5 trillion American dollars in the world,  yangs yearly pay out 30 trillion, do the math, if that's not enough 80 trillion dollars value of all countries money in the world, yang would need it all to for the program to last 2.5 years, and if that's not enough The feds take in 3.25 trillion in tax revenue per a year, so Andrew need 10.2 years of tax revenue to pay for 1 year, you are not getting you $1,000.00 per a month for life time unlessss you work for it and you can earn more just working for it.
#####
4:35 Do you put this on all your videos? I think not, so why this one only?

4chan has become a pool of shit in recent years. Too bad.
#####
Thanks for what you do; I am sorry you where attacked! He is now a true phenomenal, and we pray for him, his family and team's safety
#####
Was 4Chan really targeting Carly the only message I seen from this is Carly shills for Israel. If this is true how would this be targeting women??? Hell I've been seeing more Women in my age group with a job then Men and being paid more for the same retail or fast food work.
#####
Carly, your doing awesome!! It is the historic moment. It won‚Äôt come again and again. Go go yang 2020!!

Andrew Yang will shape the world for better place without a doubt cz I hv been listening his thoughts for sometimes and all make sense !! He is super intelligent and very kind man. Vote for Andrew  if u care humanity. From Canada
#####
Are there people who are actually happy to receive calls about donations at 7h00?
#####
3:16 You're right men don't face this, that's because they don't report these events because it'll show weakness in their eyes. Statements like "like a girl" "man up" are contributing to the drastic increase in male suicide rates compared to the declining female suicide rates.
#####
wish i was an american so i could vote for this man
#####
Get him on JRE again!!
#####
That last message though, It's totally unrelated to the video and is a promotion of the boss
#####
What I'd like to know is: How long has this been going on?  Is this something that I was supposed to be getting?  Is the $1,000/mo. the rightful award?  What changed everyone's mind?  If I was supposed to be getting at least something (but wasn't) where is the crime?
#####
So this is the girl who has been sending me all those emails for donations
#####
No more big money campaigns.
#####
casual bloomberg shill at the end there
#####
Yang would make an excellent Republican president üëçbut he shouldn't be running for leader of a left wing party. Both parties have been run by the same types of people for too long. Corporatists. That's a problem. Alot of us are completely unrepresented. Real leftists. It's really not very fair and not democratic that only capitalists are represented in government.
#####
Not all heroes wear capes.
#####
Thank you Carly for everything you‚Äôve done for this campaign!! We DO like what we are seeing!!! :D
#####
If you‚Äôre American, the first step to Andrew Yang becoming your President is believing he can win. The second step is donating and telling everyone you know about him. The third step is actually voting for him!!!
#####
Men face the same ruthless attack online as women. The language is different but same viciousness
#####
imagine calling women morons while running for president...
#####
I was lowkey hoping they would show Evelyn but this girl rocks!
#####
I really hope everyone in the comments who‚Äôs of age actually goes out and votes!
#####
I support Yang, but everyone faces harassment on the internet, not just women. Doxxing can happen to anyone and it sucks regardless of who it happens to
#####
Shitty Edit but I love you Carly!
#####
Lol, dont get on the wrong side of 4chan
#####
She looks legit. I am shy so it is very hard for me to ask for money or even small favor. She seems to be the exact type of person who will be amazing in action for this type of position. Strong woman indeed.
#####
Great job, you are a brave woman!
#####
I'm fapping to Carly! Sorry, but not really sorry!
#####
Carly is awesome
#####
She seems awesome. Has anything good EVER come out of 4chan?
#####
The bad trolls should‚Äôve used gender neutral insults... fkn misogynistic trolls.

I‚Äôm very happy üòÉ andrew Yang is gonna take money from you guys and give it me yay üòÅ.

Ngl this was a really good video...up until they had to mention Bloomberg.
#####
Bloomberg, put the Democratic primary disclaimer at the top of your videos please! I‚Äôm glad you are doing it, but do the fully right thing and put it at the top!
#####
I love Carly, she is the reason why I donate more than I should
#####
Bruh men are also doxxed by 4chan.
#####
What? She doesn‚Äôt know that men get more doxxed than women. It‚Äôs not only targeted to girls.
#####
I guarantee you that if there was ranked based voting there would be dozens of these people running each election.
#####
I want to join the Campaign I live in the Philippines but the American Citizens living abroad are not recognized. WE VOTE too, it is time for the website to indicate that, so we can put in our Zip Codes and Join.

Andrew Yang proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally ‚Äì most would prefer cash with no restriction.

A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

The means to pay for the basic income will come from four sources:

1. Current spending: We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like. This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because people already receiving benefits would have a choice between keeping their current benefits and the $1,000, and would not receive both.

Additionally, we currently spend over 1 trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like. We would save $100 ‚Äì 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up. Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.
2. A VAT: Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone. A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue. A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

3. New revenue: Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy. The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy will grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. This would generate approximately $800 ‚Äì 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth.

4. Taxes on top earners and pollution: By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend. We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.
#####
Her Fake "Good Morning" calls make everyone ready to spend money desperately wishing she not call them ever again! 

P.s. I'm Andrew Yang supporter and actually like this lady too, but simply cannot resist to put this comment with hope make you smile! :) 
Merry Christmas Everyone!

When you are caring for a child with Autism and a parent with Alzheimer‚Äôs, you see the financial toll it takes to keep your household running. It‚Äôs difficult to keep everything operating smoothly when you are paying for medications that cost more than $200, plus the monthly insurance premiums. For Autism disorders, you have to take into consideration the additional costs, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, CBT, and the time spent going to these appointments. 

As for Alzheimer‚Äôs, my mother‚Äôs condition is worsening, we started her on physical therapy and added dietary supplements. We have other expenses, such as, adult diapers, bed pads, a wheel chair, shower chair, orthopedic shoes, and more things that were added into the household budget. It‚Äôs expensive. There are months when we buy a pack of Ensure (nutritional supplements) over a pack of meat or a pound or two of oranges. 

Autism and Alzheimer‚Äôs are two very expensive neurological disorders. The $1000 financial incentive for caregivers sounds wonderful, and it will help families struggling to pay these ridiculous medical bills tremendously. The question is, will taxing these big tech corporations and retail corporations actually produce enough revenue to make this happen? Are there actual, physically drafted plans and steps to make this happen? ü§îüßêü§®

I approve these message cause it‚Äôs hard being a caregiver and still have to work on top of taking care of a loved one ....

One problem though, he DOSN‚ÄôT support Medicare for all. Only the Spirit of it. He also has 2 corporate donors where Bernie has none.
#####
I support the idea of Andrew Yang, but I will not join the Yang Gang. Why? He lies. He said in this ad and before that he is for medicare for all, then you hear him elsewhere saying he supports the idea of of medicare for all. You might say "so", well he has said that about other stuff he does not actually support "I support the idea of a $15 minimum wage" it's basic political bullshit where you say you support someone cause when you aren't even near that on the actual position. The plan he put is not on the level of medicare for all, it's not even on the level of a public option. I would avoid getting bullshitted by another liar, you already know the person in the race with 40 years of experience and a record of being for the issues before they were mainstream.
#####
I‚Äôm voting for Yang
#####
i see bernie bros disliking this video
#####
Stop lying about your support for Medicare For All! You don‚Äôt support it! You have your own plan that is arguably more conservative than Biden‚Äôs! I want to like you dude, but you have already been called out on this, and releasing a new ad after the fact still claiming to support M4A means you are a brazen liar.
#####
BS. HE DOES NOT SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. His medical plan doesn‚Äôt even have a public option.
#####
Hi, do you really support M4A? I thought you don't.
#####
He doesn‚Äôt support Medicare for all. This is a flat lie.
#####
Also also.. wouldn't ubi inflate all the prices?
#####
Liar!
Yang is not for Medicare For All! He just wants to use the label because it's popular!
He admitted it on ABC News.
And by the way Yang, Medicare For All is not just an idea or framework.
IT'S AN ACTUAL BILL! AND SANDERS WROTE THE DAMN BILL!
#####
So.. is anyone going to to point out the false advertising for Medicare for all? Isn't that liable in a court?
#####
Maybe YouTube should block false political ads? Yang's health policy is not M4A. His policy says, "I... believe that swiftly reformatting 18% of our economy and eliminating private insurance for millions of Americans is not a realistic strategy..."
#####
stop lying in your ads! you don't support medicare for all so stop using it in your ads!
#####
Basically lied about supporting Medicare for all.... he doesn't support it! Doesn't even have a public option..  clearly wants to mislead voters into thinking that he supports Medicare for all. Disappointed.
#####
You don't support medicare-for-all though. You're literally lying lmfao
#####
yang is a liar, he doesnt support m4a

...bernie does tho, im voting for him
#####
Yang no longer supports Medicare for All, yet claims so in this ad. I like the ideas Yang is bringing to the table, but have to say I'm quite disappointed.  Bernie 2020 for real change.
#####
For M4A in spirit... drop out already
#####
Yang gang go to his web page and read his health plan...its not Medicare for all...its Medicare for those who want it while still leaving insurance companies active! That will not work! Bernie 2020 because he's the only one that is fighting for an actual Medicare for all!
#####
How can you get by lying about Medicare for All in your ads?? Your health plan isn't Medicare for All and it doesn't even have a public option that even the centrists included... This is shameful
#####
How many people put dislike because he lied about M4A? üëç
#####
Oopsie! *won‚Äôt fight for Medicare For All

Must have been a typo in the script.
#####
Yeah he‚Äôs not for Medicare for all.
#####
People are actually falling for this lie. He doesn't support M4A, this ad is misinforming people and you're just using the popularity to con people in to voting for you.
#####
I like Yang, I like the overall message of this ad, but he absolutely does not support Medicare for All. Supporting "in spirit" does not count. Yang would be my second choice if he truly supported M4A.
#####
But he doesn‚Äôt support Medicare for all
#####
Lol this ad is a lie if you go on his website it says something totally different, in fact he doesn't even mention Medicare for all.
#####
> Says he's for medicare for all
> Doesn't really stand for medicare for all
Oh, Yang, you're appealing to your supporters' ignorance, the rest knows you're full of it.
#####
You don‚Äôt even support Medicare for all stop lying. I like Yang. But lying is unacceptable for anyone. He clearly stated he doesn‚Äôt support it
#####
Andrew Yang does not support Medicare for All. Please do not be fooled by this.
#####
YANG DO YOU SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL, OR THE SPIRIT OF IT?! Don't lie to the American people!
#####
"He‚Äôll fight for Medicare for all‚Äù
Press X to doubt
#####
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll fight for Medicare for all‚Äù Lies!! You‚Äôve already said several times you don‚Äôt support Medicare for all so why do you continue putting it in your ads?
#####
Medicare for All?! What a liar. Get this shill out of the race.
#####
Liar. You don't support Medicare For All.
#####
He does not support medicare for all.
#####
Yang's wife can get it though üçÜ
#####
Please, folks, check your facts and a range of reliable sources for yourselves. Mr. Yang has explicitly said that he now does  *_NOT_ * support Medicare for All. It's a shame. At the very least, he had come across as an honest, decent fellow, but this deception and double-speak is extremely troubling and disappointing.
#####
Andrew Yang is against medicare for all.
#####
Mr. Yang, what exactly is your "M4A" medicare plan? Is it M4A at all?
#####
Very concerned about the messaging on Healthcare. People are turned off by this = please please clarify this message and update the website, talking point everything- This is the number one issue for many people please address it!! Difficult to Yang people with this kind of confusion. Yang 2020
#####
Medicare for all******
#####
His healthcare plan is NOT a Medicare4All plan...

This is a lie...

It is a public option that will take MANY YEARS to reach young families with special needs children effectively keeping people from changing jobs, starting businesses and leaving abusive partners... 

It also does nothing to get healthcare off the backs of employers nor does it do anything to insure that providers will accept the public option or to reduce administrative costs for providers... 

All it does is protect private health insurance profits... 

Private insurance companies will scoop up the young, healthy and affluent at high profits while the public option will be under funded and strapped with the elderly, ill and poor and will therefore reduce quality and patient control...

It will cost as much as many employees spend on employer plans while reducing the value of UBI to unemployed caregivers and single parents by forcing them to forfeit the basic resources they currently receive and adding healthcare costs to their already fragile budgets... 

His UBI/Healthcare package effectively removes any semblance of freedom that he claims they offer...

In states that didn't expand Medicaid people will either forfeit their Medicaid or UBI... 

This not only reduces/eliminates the benifits of UBI to low income families but their communities as well...

And yes, I understand that UBI is "opt in"... 

My point is that this is no different than the asinine rules that make current programs not work very well to lift people out of poverty and also makes his UBI absolutely NOT universal, nothing like the Alaskan Oil Dividend, nothing like Thomas Payne's retirement and graduation benifits and nothing like MLK's UBI... 

Saying his plan is universal is an absolute lie... It is only universal for those who already have plenty...

He shouldn't be making rules that keep the poor from accessing the UBI, magnifies the stigma of those who choose to remain on current programs and forces people to choose between UBI and access to healthcare...

His goal is not to lift people out of poverty, stimulate low income communities or keep people afloat when their job gets automated away...

If it were he would make UBI a progressive refundable tax credit that would phase out at about $120,000 agi that could be distributed in monthly payments... 

If he did this the program would help those who need it most, cost less, encourage work and education, stimulate the economies that need it most and offer the freedom of which he speaks...

His goal is actually to destroy and eliminate current programs for the poor due to "low participation"...

It is insane, asinine and frankly just shitty to finance a welfare program for those who have plenty by reducing/eliminating benifits to those that are already struggling and by adding to the tax burden of local and small businesses...

Why doesn't he just do what he says he will do...

Finance the program with taxes on Online Sales, Automation, Data Transfers and Artificial intelligence...?

There are much better ways to do this and I am hoping that Tulsi Gabbard will release details on her UBI plan soon because she also has a much better healthcare plan that neither destroys private insurance nor makes certain people wait longer than others to access it...
#####
I like Yang but he better get much clearer on what exactly his healthcare plan is. Ok people can keep their private insurance. But is there a government plan ( of any name, not necessarily Medicare for over 65s) that people 18 to 65 can buy into?  What about people presently who qualify for Medicaid?
#####
Such a great message! If Americans chooses Trump or Biden over this guy, the country deserved whatever happens to it. MATH
#####
0:10 They way they look at each other...
#####
Yang has now established himself as a household name.
If he doesn't win this time, he should run again.
#####
Ok who is gonna pay for everyone to have a 1000 every month probably the people with jobs or the country debt will rise. And taxes will be so high it won‚Äôt even be worth having a job and the government will have all the control over your money and every one will be poor.
#####
Yeeesss!!
#####
Staying home with your kids, receiving $1,000.00 a month vs. getting a high paying job and paying someone $1,000.00 a month to watch your kids, Pure genius.
#####
I am a fulltime unpaid caregiver for my grandma. We are struggling financially. Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend will do so much for all our citizens who truly need it. Think of the homeless, and those living in poverty. They need it most. I hope people also use this FD to help animals in need. We all need a little help sometimes. This would be a permanent fix. It is a wonderful gesture. Truly.
#####
this is the first year i can vote and i know exactly who i'm voting for.
#####
Just found out about him today. I‚Äôm not even American and I am rooting for him üòÇ 

Support from a 20yo from The Netherlands ‚ù§Ô∏è
#####
some long shots are worth the effort. yang would be a total game changer.
#####
If everyone has robust Medicare for All and an adult child and ailing parent(s) are collecting $12,000/year, there would be many 2-income households in which one income earner could either quit or reduce their hours to care for ailing parent(s).  This would greatly reduce the current costs in the Medicare/Medicaid programs by reducing the number of times ailing parents are placed in rehab or nursing homes.  UBI and Medicare for All will also reduce the duration of the ailing parent‚Äôs stay in rehab and or reduce their time in a nursing home or keep them out of a nursing home altogether.  This paradigm would free up nurses to care for the additional people entering the Medicare for All program.
#####
I dont wanna blame any kinds of people any more, the truth is we all have the same blood. We all are human we should all care for one another no matter what
#####
I am confused. Please someone explain. During the debate, Yang was not for getting rid of the private insurance. How is medicare for all possible like this?
#####
As someone who has struggled with Aspergers and other mental issues.. I appreciate a candidate like Andrew Yang putting mental health as a top priority. I feel mental health is ignored by politicians when it's so important, and it makes me feel good to see a humane candidate who cares about this issue.
#####
Chinese Spy
#####
Thank you Yang family for bringing us on this amazing journey.  We the people need Andrew to be our president.  Health insurance is so corrupt and expensive that we have to make choices that put us in substantial debt to get healthy or take the risk and hope for the best.  This is not how it should be and changes need to happen now.  Let's keep humanity first and put the Yang's in the White House.
#####
Evelyn is cute af!

Edit: Don't jump on me, I'm sure Andrew approves this message.
#####
You. Don't. Support. Medicare. For. All. Stop. Lying.
#####
Andrew Yang is light years ahead of the other candidates.
#####
I cant believe people are so afraid of Trump, we need to kill off that mental collective hate Trump has build with his nasty self! I feel like we were moving towards a better world, however I feel this country needed Trump to bring out the rats from the dark so we know that they're really their and yes its a problem and we need to address it, bring to the table, dissect the problem and fix it! some people thought racism was abolish and then boom! Trump!  He destroyed the grip America had around the world which at this point Im glad!
 The US were the ones that influence the world but it got out of hand.
#####
Marvelous
#####
I think a lot of people know someone who takes care of another person and we‚Äôre his policies could really go a long way too helping  them, he is so nice
#####
Read the policy on his website, it is NOT Medicare for all, it is NOT even a public option, it's continuing of a status quo. Not a single word about universal coverage in his plan.
#####
My Friends ask me why are you so much interested in American Precedential Election? and why do you care if Andrew Yang wins or not.....
I simply say World Needs Great Leaders
#####
Why does Andrew keep lying about being for Medicare for all?
#####
I like Andrew Yang but Medicare for all sounds like a pipe dream. If you look at the future predictions for Medicare the program is already in peril and it is estimated that it will start running out of funds as soon as 2026. The government would either have to start making cuts or raise taxes to save it.
#####
Some communist policies going on here.
#####
Dude, Evelyn is actually stunning.

I Love Yang and am totally Yang Gang (after Bernie :-/) but... That medicare for all line is just a little disingenuous. He's not for "Medicare for All" really, not like Bernie anyway. I just wish he would clarify his stance. Just my thoughts.
#####
I was a caregiver for my mom when she was passing. She lived for 4 years longer than the doctors gave (which I am grateful for). However, after my mom passed I was left out of the loop with the network I was working at before. I couldn't get back into my field so I took up car sales (which is a couple steps away from automation right now) and cycles employees. Now I'm out of work and trying to find any job at all. So here I am struggling every day and I'm still working on paying the studamt loans for the education that I never got to use. I Love Yang in 2020 because I feel like he sees me.
#####
Love EY too.
#####
These ads are so much better now because it isnt a robot speaking about the automation take over.  Thanks whoever out there who heard our input.
#####
Yang for pres!
#####
Since we as Americans have to be a piece of the machine and work hard so we can one day retire. It‚Äôs not surprising we have so many people suffering around the country. It‚Äôs like the system we created is actually meant to hurt us. üßê
#####
My father is 65 with a heart condition still working because SS isn't enough. It's killing him. If UBI gets implemented he can finally retire and I can get money to take care of him. It would change my entire family forever. No one in my family ever voted and until recent conversations my parents considered themselves highly conservative just because we're in Texas mostly. We're all voting Yang and spreading the word.
#####
If you guys are in the early states please canvas and spread the word of Andrew Yang!

Well he just presented ideas that sounds good but doesn't work. Listen people, UBI cost 3 trillion a year. Do you know that as of Dec 2018 US government debt is 21 trillion . If they government can collect taxes through VAT and spend less on other welfare programs as Andrew suggested they would have done this ages ago to improve their budget. And there were no government shut down due to budget dispute in the past years.  How the 3 trillion UBI will pass Congress ?  

Common people . Please think critically. Either Andrew genuinely  doesn't know that or he knew but still promised his voters these impractical things to win votes. Gods know wat he really thinks.

I've said this a thousand times, but I'm gonna say it again.  It's smart as hell how Yang was playing political chess this whole time, laying back while other candidates weakened each other and fell outta the way, andd Yang kept rising slowly in the background.  But now he's top 5 and only the front-runners are left.  IT'S TIME TO UPSHIFT.

Yang, you gotta come out swinging in the next debate.  Dominate the conversation with substance, force the debate you want to have, challenge the front-runners on their data.  Show why their ideas aren't effective enough and why your platforms are superior.  Grab the spotlight, grab the speaking time, grab the mic.


YOU NEED TO PICK A FIGHT.  Not a personal one necessarily, but definitely a policy one.  You have to CONTRAST yourself and show why you are the One.  There's not much time left to break into the top-tier.  If you don't cause a stir that has the MSM talking heads focused on you one way or another after this debate, I don't know how many opportunities there will be left.  IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

Yang, "Medicare for All is not the name of a Bill"   Bernie, " I wrote the damned bill"!!!   - Fucking Yang went alternative facts on us.
#####
Yang. Just like Buttigieg, but with better jokes.
#####
It is unbelievable that Yang can call his health plan "Medicare for All", yet provide no expansion for medicare or even a public option.His plan is worst than Bidens or Buttigieg.   He literally said "Medicare for All is not a bill".... What.... Fucking what? Are all Yang supporters taking crazy pills.  Medicare for all is a bill. Like in real life.  It is a fucking bill, both in the house (Jayapal) and in the Senate (Sanders) . It's a fucking bill.  What is this? We can wake up and change the meaning of what Medicare is and pretend a Medicare for all is not the name of a Bill in existence . Who fucking does that????  Yang used to be in my top 3, but when you lose trust in someone, it is over.  I just can't believe all these comments just let him slide on this. What else is he misleading about or will he change his stance on??? And I really did like him, which is the worst part of all.

Trump is both a symptom and a cause

You would not have gone ahead with the Iran strike this week if you were president....probably because you are full of shit and an outright coward.

Andrew Yang gave decisive and appropriate answers without the usual vague and evasive answers like other candidates/politicians.  Tough questions will make him a better debater and as a future nominee against Trump on stage.
#####
Let me get this straight:
A party that supports abortion over life, illegal‚Äôs over it‚Äôs own citizens and refugees over it‚Äôs veterans is going to lecture me on MORALS ?
I DON‚ÄôT‚ÄôT THINK SO.
This is the new Democratic party renamed the (CSNP) Communist Socialist Nazi Party‚Ä¶¬† !!! WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!

‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù........‚ÄùHappy holidays‚Äù great another Nobama trying to give people $1000 a month....That‚Äôs the same as saying he‚Äôs going to pay for your votes he‚Äôll never make it to the top. TRUMP 2020 üòÅ
#####
Biden and Bernie lose elections, Trump supporters like this one.
#####
This interviewer can‚Äôt handle nuance. There seems to be a bit of animosity toward Yang....sounds like a textbook ideologue. Ideologues like the interviewer are why I‚Äôm voting for Yang.
#####
reporter's a dumbass.
#####
All this people commenting are paid and part of a elaborated political  campaign ......we all know what politicians are capable of in this country for votes üëéüèª. .....No honesty/radical inhuman ideas/their own political agenda/false promises/ridiculous stupid new laws to screw people
#####
1,000 dollars a month is not gonna work I'm sorry it just isn't.
#####
It's not left, it's not right, it's FUCK MSNBC  
The one thing we can all agree on. :)
#####
In a Twitter battle in 2016, Warren beat Trump.
#####
Every interviewer always stuttering with a Yang lol
#####
Joe Nathan McKelvey Jr here 2020 is Here
#####
This interviewer is retarded
#####
This reporter is horrible at interviewing!  Just pushing the impeachment horse shit.  Ask the candidate questions about him being our future leader!  Just instead hammering away at what makes ratings, Trump and impeachment.  Terrible.
#####
Id vote for him. He comes with logical views of whats going on in the real world. The only thing I believe he should get rid of is the medicare for all. Better regulation of the medical system will fix this and lower costs. Also, he hit on a key tax of taxing google and Amazon  which I hope would be expanded more. Cut payroll taxes and put money back into the consumers hands and add a federal sales and electronic tax.
#####
Yang is a centrist corporate democrat. He has been bought and paid for. We see you. If you want whip cream get on your knees. He lost me when he said he would pardon trump. Smh.
#####
God this news anchor is a dick, not even a good one.

#####
Doctor's viewpoint on healthcare:
https://youtu.be/SlzRs5bgV-k
#####
If You haven't figured it out yet, Yang is a Democrat and NOT a socialist like the rest of the Democratic Party has turned into. He believes in an adjustment to capitalism that reduces the disparity between classes but it is applied evenly so that it doesn't create a divide. Think about it. Really think about it. Don't just tow a party line. This is the ONLY way forward. Medicare for all by Yang is making healthcare available through competition. No other candidate is saying that because the liberal mindset is FREE STUFF! That doesn't actually work and widens the class division. Yang is the first intelligent voice I've heard in politics since Ron Paul who was the founder of grass roots politics in our modern era. Only Yang doesn't have so many personality tics to make fun of so the T.V./internet nation can see he is electable.
#####
Yang! Get us out of these bullshit wars!!
#####
He fucking trying so hard to make Yang look stupid..  iiiiii uhh iii uuhh but but but uh uh but uh uh i uh.. 


so so but but but so so so... Let the man fucking talk dude. 



The people see the curtain ABC they see how corrupt the DNC really is.
#####
20% üëé but almost 100% of the comments are positive? Hmmm...
#####
The underlying disease is the DemocRATS   n their puppets on the strings.
#####
He needs to clarify his message on healthcare IN WRITING. His plan on the website is too ambiguous, which is what led to the confusion the interviewer displayed here when yang talked about his plan for expanding medicare. I recommend the following:

As President, I plan to . . .
Lower the age of eligibility for medicare over a set period of time to provide healthcare for all US citizens, and demonstrate the superiority of medicare for all over the private insurance companies. I will not outlaw private insurance but force them to compete with the public plan, and squeeze into a supplementary market role over time.


In order to ensure the economic feasibility of universal Medicare, I will . . .
Rationalize healthcare costs across all areas of the industry, thus bringing costs into alignment with the costs of care in other industrialized nations.
#####
I'm from Iowa, I was for Trump now I am for Yang because he focuses on Fixing America rather then blaming Trump for everything.
#####
My vote is secured.. Yang 2020
#####
Wang will not be president, this is a fact.
#####
YOU ARE WRONG TRUMP IS A CURE, BUT DEMOCRAPS AND YOU ARE AN ILLNESS WITHOUT CURE, A PESTILENCE, BESIDES OF BEING A BUNCH OF COWARDS WHO ARE IN PANIC AND RUNNING BECAUSE THE ATTACK TO IRAN, AND PREFER TO GIVE THEM MONEY, BECAUSE YOU, DEMONRATS, ARE CHICKENS AND COWARDS. BUT DONT WORRY WE HAVE NOW A PRESIDENT WITH THE BALL TO DEFEND US. HEHEHEHEHE
#####
I like Andrew Yang Medicare for All plan. I have private health insurance provided from my provider. People don't have government healthcare but you should not take away my insurance. Yang's plan is perfect.
#####
We have already had a black president
We have already had an orange president
Now we need an Asian president
#####
President Trump is curing the disease that has been destroying our nation, liberalism. The government is going to compete with the private health insurance sector? What an idiot. The government can print money, tax people/companies and create what ever law they want. How is that fair competition? Government has never run anything successfully. Never.
#####
Who is this reporter? He‚Äôs a piece of shit
#####
Polls?????  Really? That's conducted on land lines!!!!  Who has land lines?  Who answers calls from unknown numbers?  Insanity
#####
Yang2020 his momentum is growing by the day. He‚Äôs going to be the last Dem standing against Trump.
#####
Yang will bring balance üòâ
#####
I laugh at how hard these guys try but no matter what, they will never defeat Mr. Angrew Yang! #YangGang #Yang2020
#####
He just can't be around too many men or he "becomes stupid." So he might be too fragile to lead our country.
#####
Fuck, Andrew Yang is too good at these interviews !
#####
AND.....THE RESULT..PEOPLE NEEDING DISABILITY, MEDICAL HELP, SECTION 8 WILL LOSE ALL THEIR BENEFITS CREATING AN EVEN WORSE SITUATION AND MORE EXPENSIVE!! THE EXTRA CASH WOULDNT COVER THE RENT INCREASE, BUY FOOD, PAY FOR MEDS.....NOT A GOOD IDEA
#####
For Andrew's blessed team: How do we cure the illness? We have children born to increasing numbers of drug addicts and alcoholics - hence reasons for ever-increasing genetic involvement (RE: Familial Epi-Genetics).
#####
Is it just me or is Andrew Yang losing more subscribers. üòëüò∂
#####
This is the guy to vote for. Genuine, intelligent, practical, and future minded. Please do not miss this opportunity to move past our bullshit toxic two party system that only seems to accomplish divisiveness.
#####
A once in a lifetime candidate god bless

This dude is a Marxist dope.
He worked for Obama.That alone should tell you he's worthless.

I'll vote for Andrew Yang or Trump! DNC better nominate Yang!!

#####
The interviewer was rude and combative. Try as you might to play Yang into a corner and he comes out ahead.
#####
Andrew Yang has soo much patience.   Same questions again and again.   Homework is good interviewers     Talking about (except for Hasan (patriot act)  he was ready) policies and different stuff.
#####
Rest of the Democrats be like, "Yeah... That's cool and all... But as the only person of color competing for the nomination, what do you think about race and racism and the racial racist racism that's racially racialized our racist races??"
#####
Opening statement "I play RACE CARD!" Lol treating another race better based on race is still racism but only white males can be racist these days.
#####
Yang doesn't want Medicare for all and his plan is obviously NOT Medicare for all but his ads are saying he is for Medicare for all. 
Here's a $1k dude, good luck with your $300k medical bill.
#####
Trump is the consequence, not the symptom.
#####
This dude's gonna get creamed in NH Bernie and Warren are from neighboring states. I live in NH and saw 2k Bernie Sanders supporters to see him make an appearance. He made traffic delays.
#####
You can see in the interviewer's face that he doesn't care for yang and was trying to burn him with lame lines. 


Yang speaks facts he's kind of impervious to BS.
#####
Hey guys I'm trying to go to Iowa to canvass for Yang during Yang week, if anyone wants to help me out and donate a couple bucks to help pay for my stay I'm at @surfersforyang on venmo. I'll be doing 8 hours of door knocking every day from the 6th to the 11th of January :) Anything would help thank you so much Yang Gang!
#####
$100 that interviewer isn‚Äôt as hard as he is here with other candidates lol  dude was rough
#####
I am so tired of Andrew getting asked what someone rich will do with the thousand a month. Fucking do better research
#####
I thought, Yang was an interesting candidate for a moment, until he just basically said that he will pardon, Trump if he gets re-elected.  That's a deal breaker for me.  He will lose a lot of potential votes for that.  That's a view that he can't walk back, because no one will trust his word on that.  He'll tell us what we want to hear to get our vote.
#####
Andrew has my vote!  #yang2020!!!
#####
Yang for president fuck the haters nobody wants Biden the pedophile running our country
#####
I hope he wins. Im working on starting a business in game development and 1k a month would be extremely helpful in getting a powerful enough desktop
#####
What's the point of a show trial for which the verdict has already been decided?
#####
more lefitsm, more gov't, more 'free' stuff... there are still people who fall for this?? only ONE system works: capitalism and small gov't
#####
Andrew yang!
#####
With every interview, town hall, and debate Yang continues to bring us together by setting the example and inspiring us all to be the compassionate, forward-thinking individuals that we all strive to be. As someone who has never run for political office he's raised the bar for being a presidential candidate in so many ways. I'm so impressed.
#####
As I said during the debate, it was an honor and disappointment to be the only candidate of color on that stage. Help me take the economic boot off the throats of our communities of color, and donate at: https://yang2020.social/yt10

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
He should use this clip as a campaign ad, in my opinion it feels a lot more powerful than a lot of the other videos he has posted

#####
What a disgusting question. Why do Democrats hate European Americans?
#####
Why is he of color and others not? White people are not ‚Äúwhite‚Äù.
#####
Every single person I‚Äôve ever asked says they like yang, but he‚Äôs never their first choice. I still have no idea why.
#####
PLEASE GO OUT AND VOTE!!! YOUR VOTE DOES MATTER! EXPRESS YOUR RIGHT!!
#####
So what are the chances of Yang winning at this point? I don‚Äôt see why people should vote for anyone else, the rest of the candidates are washed up with dirty money in there pockets and dirty secrets
#####
Go Andrew Yang! Greetings from overseas
#####
I wish he had a chance. I wish there was more I could do but its just not going to happen. Trump 2020
#####
Give people thousand and raise rent by thousand.
#####
Yikes..no thanks
#####
YANG GANGGGG
#####
DON'T BE A VICTIM.
#####
The left needs to make a segment of the population to feel marginalized. It feeds into victim mentality. When you accept you live in the greatest republic that has ever existed and opportunity is abound, it's not about race or color, it's about choices.
#####
Got my vote
#####
Corey is watching Corey in the house.
#####
Andrew Yang  2020 instead Andrew Yang never
#####
I like this dude. He made those white candidates bow their heads in because they're, "damn he's right. "
#####
Ron Paul 2.0
We the People, want him, so we're not getting him
#####
Who cares if he‚Äôs the only candidate of color?
#####
I am so tied of looking at Trump and hearing his lies. With his lips turned up. To get Trump out of the White House I would probably vote for The Jolly Green Giant. Ho, Ho. Ho,  just to get Trump out of the President's Office.
#####
So where does that freedom dividend come from? Oh that‚Äôs right, you take it from other people. No thanks.
#####
The assumption of giving people 1k a month is stupid. If you dont understand money you will always have issues. You need to understand the money game, dividends, saving and investing, living and consuming LESS than what you earn. NOT showing off to people that dont care about you, paying off credit cards and eliminating debt, learning a skill that's in demand and then getting paid for it. These are the things that help people, not just spoiling them with 1k for them to WASTE
#####
Ppl commenting oh he‚Äôs right my question stand up and do something about it ... VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO CARES .. make a difference
#####
I like Yang. However ,the nationwide income is a terrible plan. If you give everyone a diamond, the diamond will become worthless. AKA - inflation baby, simple economics. Thankfully we have a congress that will never allow such a foolish idea to become a law.
#####
This is the absolute best answer he could have given
#####
Sir if a smaller nation can't afford and sustain a fraction of their population at a smaller rate of Universal Basic Income we cannot sustain a larger amount at a larger population. We do not want you socialism
#####
I refuse to vote for a politician that doesn‚Äôt wear a tie.
#####
He really thinks if you give a black household $1,000 a month that they‚Äôre going to donate some of that to a political candidate? Lmao
#####
Coming from an migrant Asian American family growing up In the mean streets of hacienda heights I can tell you take my word DISPOSABLE income is the answer to our economy please ...please I beg of you 1000$ a month will save the people from the bad orange üçä man
#####
Guaranteed income = first step to communism. Doesnt work.
#####
Staying super optimistic right now for Yang.
#####
Unpopular opinion: race has nothing to do with income
#####
USA and their obsession with colors.
#####
Id like to know where this guy got his stats from.

Sounds ridiculously skewed to me.
#####
1000 per month?  No then we are relying on the gvt for our money.
#####
Kamala and Corey's campaigns have  more money than Bernie's. They dropped out because they were polling bad. But Yang made it about money. Well, he's a politician after all so he has to lie to winüòîüòî
#####
When did we humans become more then 1 race? Did i miss a human evolution? Mutants? U lost me at talk of diffrent races. Color isnt a race, under youre skin we are exactly the same. Its called anatomy. Using the word race in social terms is absolutly mindblowing dumb. But gl on presidency, he sound like a down to earth kind of guy ‚úåÔ∏èüòä Ethnicity for President
#####
I liked Andrew Yang until this very moment, Pandering just turns me off.
#####
I've never thought of asians as "people of color".
They seem more like super whites.
#####
If Americans had ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù income, it would go to selfish desires and wants. Not politics.
#####
I didn't know Asians were considered POCs
#####
This guy's the bomb.  He's the most well-reasoned candidate I've seen in DECADES.
#####
Or there‚Äôs just more white people in the country so by the numbers it‚Äôs more likely for candidates to be white

Side note: what is white? You‚Äôre going to separate mexican and Arabs instead of calling them both brown? While calling French and English both white? Yeah ok
#####
As a proud Trump Supporter and will of course vote for him again. I think he would do better if he talked about real issues instead of race. I‚Äôm an individual that surpasses race and judge in a person‚Äôs character.
#####
I am 100% for a guaranteed universal income if someone can show me how to do it without bankrupting the country or driving away all of the rich people to other countries and taking their money with them leaving only as poor people to suffer.  One more thing, do not think we're any different than Venezuela it happened there it will happen here if we allow irresponsible people to give universal guaranteed income without figuring out how to do it without bankrupting the country.
#####
You give someone  that makes poor life choices free money,  and all of the sudden they will make good life choices ? 
That's not how it works.
98% of people in western culture are not poor because they dont get enough financial support,  they are poor because of poor life choices.
#####
Correct answer: Doesn‚Äôt matter what color the president is or whose on the damn stage, matters which one is genuinely and affectively going to help all people in the country
#####
Is this a...joke?


Those "statistics" that Andrew spat out have very important context, I can't believe people are buying into this snake-oil salesman...this is the first year I have ever not identified as a democrat...it makes me feel like I've been left behind. Please, citizens of the US and the world - do not make the same mistakes of the past - if someone promises you $1,000/month of UBI if they're elected, that should raise red flags. I wish people read more and understood history and mathematics...not everyone is a fucking nerd like myself and it pains me to see these types of videos.
#####
YANG GANG
#####
"The only candidate of colour" Warren disagrees lol
#####
He is using his race to get elected. He is out right saying his policies will be based on race.
It's a slippery slope that historically has brought nothing but mass death and genocide.


I agree everything he talked about are serious issues, I am just concerned he has no idea how to fix them and is instead using race to boost numbers.
#####
Lol yeah y‚Äôall keep dreaming lol ahhhh
#####
Who cares about Color. Race does not matter but ideas. You are not oppressed because of skin Color, you're probably oppress because your more likely a dumbass who's made bad choices in life. There's nothing in America stopping anyone from succeeding.
#####
He would bankrupt the country faster than Trump is bankrupting the country.
#####
If I give people free money they‚Äôll give it to rivals! Makes sense
#####
The left makes Everyrhing about race, and its disgusting
#####
Race is voluntary you can change it at social security office. If everyone checks white then the privilege won't be exclusive. Those calling themselves white are not
#####
Oh Yang! You may not win this dirty politics but you certainly win my ‚ô•. Go
#####
Why not make it $2,000 a month?
#####
He knockin heads off lol
#####
So how is offering Americans $1,000 a month not asking to essentially by their vote with our tax dollars not to mention it's impossible to sustain pain every American person $1,000 a month
#####
Be real, he cant realistically give $1,000 a month to every American over 18 without destroying our economy. This is way out of the American budget and when the economy fails due to Andrew Yang's incompetence, you cant blame it on Trump
#####
You didn‚Äôt go viral brudda.
#####
I like yang, but the freedom dividend is a terrible idea
#####
Im a Trump fan but to be honest, people like Tulsi and Yang have been really impressing me lately and i do feel and strongly think that they really do deserve a chance. Actually!!
#####
Yang beats Trump


You can have Yang, or you can have more Trump.


Yang beats Trump
#####
Why is this on my feed.
#####
The government can't give you a single thing ,  that it doesn't take from someone else first.
#####
You know to vote üó≥ for Yang ‚òØ, when Trump can't say anything "fake" or insult a statistical, rationale, common sense  opponent!!!  "Yang ‚òØ Gang" 2020!  Long live math!!!!! ‚úä
#####
What an impressive intellect. If only we Americans were inspired by intelligence.
#####
Rob the tax payer to bribe the poor to vote for you and then get back some of the money with campaign contribution. Excellent system of corruption.
#####
Well, people were asking for "Any sane adult" in 2020. Yang is a lot more than that. Basically, if you have brains, that's who you need to vote for this year! We need this guy!
#####
Ugggghh, pandering to the idiot masses
#####
Someone does their homework for sure. But let's face it, why does everything always have to go back to race? Can't we just make a decision based on factual stuff? MLK wanted people to be judged by the content of their character not their skin color.
#####
Let‚Äôs just give everyone free money so they can be even lazier then they are off welfare
#####
He's my choice 100%
#####
$1k a month for every American helps black American descendants of American slavery???? üòÇ A rising tide lifts all boats is a bold face lie and the definition of the continued benign neglect of the demographic that built this country‚Äôs economic advantage via almost 4 centuries of free labor! Foundational Black Americans don‚Äôt want our issues muddied by words like ‚Äúminorities‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople of color‚Äù etc... if a candidate can‚Äôt say the word ‚Äúblack‚Äù and aren‚Äôt guaranteeing tangibles for our people specifically then get ready for 4 more years of Trump because he isn‚Äôt any different from the liberals, he just out of the closet.
#####
You learn so much about the American condition just by listening to Andrew and watching his you tube vids..And best part is that,it is all factual,no exaggeration,no BS.! 
It is usually what Andrew says it is.. 
Can be  noticed that Andrew Yang will not make any statements that is not based on actual data or real time statistics.Just have to fact check few times on what Andrew said,then pretty much,you just get to trust what he says as a given,no need to  bother to fact check because it will be always verified when you  do so. Just trust the data and stats as given straight by  Andrew !
#####
This fool thinks 1 single person would donate that welfare payment back? üòÇüòÇ
#####
I'm very disappointed with this answer. Khamala had far more donations than most people and most people don't donate dispute their income. She, among others, met and exceeds the requirements to enter the state and other wealthy people often do not make it to the state dispute their wealth.  Most people do not donate to charity either. This is just B's propaganda.
#####
Who the heck cares what color/ethnicity someone is ?   I mean I "get" the entire experience thing.... but when we're talking "just" policy for all ? shouldn't that policy be color blind ?
#####
Race card played! Dont worry i know who has the Trump card:)
#####
1,000 a month sounds nice but it‚Äôs gonna be taken advantage of if we don‚Äôt have a way to make sure it‚Äôs not
#####
As a Republican, Yang is legit. Still like Trump more but I like Yang quite a bit.
#####
Education is more valuable than money.
#####
Since when did being an Americanized Asian make you a person of color lol. Thats just a white boy thats good at math
#####
Is so Racist to talk about race , it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with becoming president, it has to do with what you will do for the country .
#####
Lets make him our president!
#####
Yangs the Man!!
#####
yang you say ur being censored, which fair enough definitely seems like you are, but i saw you on NBC the other day during a football game, why dont you ask ron paul how hes doin.


and how is giving everyone 1k a month going to fix anything when the US dollar and fiat in general is already on the brink of collapse, i mean if you gave everyone 1k in gold that would be awesome, but 1k us dollars? come on man you seem so smart. might as well give people monopoly money.


still waiting for that ron paul stephen colbert show.


also when you criticize capitalism, are you criticizing state capitalism? like whats going on now? or are you criticizing free market capitalism.
#####
The fact Democrats  focus so heavily on the color of your skin should worry folks.
#####
Wow you guys are becoming more and more stupid as time goes on. Still talking about race and referring to certain groups as" people of color". Modern liberals are not progressive your ideology is actually having a negative impact on the psychology of humans by constantly reminding people they are different because of their race and color. Man you guys are stupid all the while making whites many of whom are broke and as powerless as anyone else the bad guy's. You guys have become poisonous, unthinking, unscrupulous individuals who just move in any direction the world desires for you, effectively robbing your minds of individuality and true intellectualism. Absolutely pathetic all of you should be ashamed of yourself for continuing these evils that have divided us for so long.
#####
That's 1000 a month is not going to do a damn thing at all. They will just raised prices to match that free money. Just like the housing, rent, food, and etc. Everything is so expensive cause the people that is working to paying for the lazy\ no working people out there. None of what he said is going to fix anything at all. Damn you people are so brain washed its starting to become completely pathetic.

How about this America, stop living above your means. A lot of people in this country live above their means and wondering why they can't afford anything in this world.
#####
Booo! I disagree, white liberals are inherently racist they are just blind to it. The real problem is that the Democrats and the media don‚Äôt want people of color running things. Look at how much speaking time the panel members get. That will tell you all you need to know.
#####
Chinese u.s president.were done this country will be 3rd world country soon..
#####
His $1000 a month is bad idea. Many welfare leeches will use that for drugs. I say we cancel free school lunch program.
#####
if each person in the us over 18 gets 1000 a month and the population is 327.2 million right now of 12/29/19 and every adult in the us takes about 70% of that population that would be rough math of around 3 trillion dollars every year i like the idea just seems hard 2 do!
#####
How can they give 338 million people 1,000 a month thats 338 billion a month, that's 4 trillion a year lol. Dummies.
#####
It takes a man like Andrew with a bold vision to lead this broken country that is supposedly the richest but least respected and most divided across the globe. We need drastic changes and Andrew Yang is the right man for the job.
#####
üß†+‚ù§Ô∏è=Yangüß¢ !!!!
#####
My babies' mommas get about $646/month.  They would better off with $1,000/month.
#####
The math on this is very simple.  Despite the devastating cost, let's consider this in an economic model.  It'll take about 6-9 months to start paying out consumers, in which time every single Fortune 500 will have a strategy to get that money back from you.  Then, local and small business will raise their prices.  This "freedom" bull!@#$ UBI really is just universal welfare that will rise costs because that's how economics works.  I'm not an economist, but it's common sense that it cheapens currency and doesn't solve the problem of tying the dollar to real perceived value + work.  

The real solution is to get the government's books in order with the same tax solutions Yang proposes, and then incentivize real competition and new forms of supply.  The problem with this Yang guy is that he encourages consumerism, not the American worker.
#####
This is when its only Andrew and himself there's no yanggang yet lol
#####
its like getting a raise!
#####
Thank you for covering Yang. Though I would like to politely remind Yahoo to keep up with the news. Yang is gaining traction and nationally polling at #6 as of early December 2019.
#####
This is Bullshit fake news old af article. Yang changed it to 18-death over half a yr ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yahoo is an enemy of real journalism and actual information apparently. Why are you rereleasing this??? Yang Gang üß¢ü¶Ö
#####
He realy looks younger
#####
Great interview!
#####
Good job Yahoo.
#####
Andrew Yang's "freedom dividend" is everything but free.  It's just shifting the burden (read: taxes) on higher income earners.
#####
Oh...he's catching on.

üß¢‚ù§üß¢‚ù§
#####
Yahoo please bring him back on! Andrew Yang for the win üß¢
#####
AndrewYang GO
#####
this guy will be serving me cocktails after election - that's what i see through a crystal ball
#####
Yahoo! needs to do a new interview with Yang.
#####
Nice to see our man has been on point and on message the whole time.  Yang 2020.
#####
Yes to your mind, no to the freedom dividend we can‚Äôt afford that right now to do long term ramifications unless you have a very specific detailed plan on how you can pay without screwing up the counter which strikes at the elite organizations who fund the earth which indirectly funds the job production of citizenry.
#####
Go YANGGANG Go!!!shoot em from orbit!!! Yea!!   YANGGANG2020 üá∫üá∏üß¢ü¶Ö
#####
This is an old interview. The policy was made broader between the recording and posting. Seems odd that they are just now releasing a months old interview.
#####
It is not 18 to 64!
It is 18 to death !
#####
How he gonna give every 325milion American 1,000$ when we already at 22trilion debt?
#####
How easily he convinces even the most skeptical that his ideas are at least worth considering. If you haven't looked into Andrew Yang before, the primaries are drawing near; now is the time. He's the only man with that combination of IQ, EQ, and T(ech)Q we have ever seen this close to the White House, and we may never get the chance again.
#####
So funny she mentioned Sam Altman, who has endorsed Andrew Yang since this aired last year.
#####
He actually doesn‚Äôt answer the questions!
#####
18 to death now
#####
My boss doesn't ask or regulate how I use my paycheck..
#####
I love it!
#####
Y'all LATE though
#####
This is incredibly outdated...
#####
ok i couldnt understand ubi til 64.   its for life
#####
Vote for Andrew Yang
#####
yang2020
#####
Yang changed the age limit 18 - to the day you expire. This interview is like a yr ago
#####
Some here say Yahoo Finance needs a new interview with Andrew Yang. I see a man, a candidate, who remains consistent with his message. Look at some of the other candidates, who have changed their message. Bernie and Tulsi are like Andrew Yang, consistent with their message and ideas. Andrew Yang wants Americans to help America, a simple idea. Can we please bump the record player to get out of our grove.
#####
Mainstream media: "He's not polling high enough to have a shot in hell to win." 
Common sense: Yea because you keep omitting him from graphics, polls and debate speaking time.
#####
Couldn't watch beyond the opening - immediately realized this must be an old interview since Andrew Yang has already modified his stance on the Freedom Dividend - it's $1k for every American til they die not 65.
#####
Now can you interview Bernie please

After I see a Yang video I get motivated not just to support him politically but in my own life.
#####
They are leaving him off of polls and ballots making pols mandatory and ifnoring him at debates  if youve seen his rallies and fundraisers you probably realized how rigged our elections are but never got angry before because every other candidate has been bad.
#####
Democrat is peace  maker, we all know if war 3 erupt is aint good for anyone
#####
He knows he wont win. But it's a perfect way to promote his person and businesses.
Even Bernie made millions from running, because of his book. Yang  is going to probably gain even more.
#####
Its not until 64! It‚Äôs until death! üò°
#####
Good for him
#####
with $1000 a month the interviewer can afford a new jeans that doesn't have two giant holes in the knee area..
#####
Smart man, but not so smart with some of the things he does during his campaign.
#####
Please update with a 2019 interview
#####
Suspend your disbelief. This man wants to give you $1000/month while he goes about solving an array of other serious problems.  Tell your friends, make sure you are registered to vote in the Primaries.
#####
Why not 65?
#####
It's $1000 a month for only 1 year. It's called temporary solution just like QE.
#####
ANDY RANDY YANG.  THE WHIPPED CREAM THING, IS THAT SOME METAPHOR OR SYMBOLISM THAT YOU VOTED FOR BILL CLINTON. THE ONLY THING, WHY ARE YOU ON THE TRAIL WITH WHIPPED CREAM OR HAD TO USE IT UP BECAUSE DONNIE LE MON MISSED HIS INTERVIEW....SNOWED IN WITH FREDO.
#####
It's until death... Not 65.
#####
Yang2020
The American Scorecard need attention
People kill themselves around the holidays
This mechanism can spotlight awareness
Perhaps we can find lasting solutions one day
#####
old interview?? only because they can monetize this.... talk about corporate greed
#####
Why did they upload an old interview? Because Andrew Yang can attract a lot of views?
#####
go yang!
#####
Damn........2018
#####
He correctly points out the drawbacks of automation but never ever in one of his interviews did he mention about the benefits of AI, technologies and automation.
#####
WTF Yahoo, a video from 2018! He‚Äôs changed the Freedom Dividend so that it‚Äôs 18->death. Stop spreading misinformation.
#####
Same old snake oil in a new fancy bottle for new customers, peddled this time by an Asian salesman wearing a hat that makes you think harder for the government instead for yourselves.
#####
It's really nice to see an interview panel with this level of maturity: no shouting over each other, no interruptions.  Good job, Y!F.
#####
YANG,  ALL LOBBYISTS WILL NEED TO LEAVE WASHINGTON.   NO MORE BRIBERY OF CONGRESSMAN FOR THEIR FOUNDATION!
#####
YANG,  please RESUSCITATE THESE RUIN CITIES ALL OVER AMERICAN.   WAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAD MADE ALL CITIES IN AMERICA LOOK WAR THROWN (houses boarded up, stores closed in poor neighborhood,  POT HOLES IN TO, TOO STREETS,  AND SO ON.
#####
Nice try Yahoo Finance. Details are that important anyway. LOL MATH
#####
I love how Kamala Harris arrogantly laughed at him during a debate for this, only to start polling lower than him and drop out before Iowa.
#####
Very compelling indeed.
#####
I recognize Andrew's old haircut... bring him on the show again!
#####
Guess what happens when you give everyone an extra $1000 per month. Companies raise their prices on everything because they figure everyone has $1000 extra every month. The problem is, they will ALL raise their prices. So the net result is people will suffer more. Look at the fiasco of Obamacare. Once insurance companies realized the government was going to subsidize healthcare, healthcare costs increased, covered services decreased, deductibles skyrocketed. Yang may be okay with math, but he doesn't know crap about capitalist culture. Give more free crap, the market will demand more.
#####
These questions are simply wrong and miss the mark big time.  So sad too bad.
#####
This video is a bit old and disingenuous in making assumptions laced in the questions.
#####
Yahoo boardroom: All of our reporters are currently dedicated to writing smear articles or biased reporting on Andrew Yang...  but he‚Äôs so trending right now, so let‚Äôs repost a year-old interview to get the revenues while we re-hash old skepticism.
#####
Wonder why they reposting.
#####
Freedom Dividend is for 18 year old thru the entire life.
#####
Got some nerve running this old interview after the crap your pundits have said about Yang and his policies in the past.
#####
Nice interview great Yahoo and I like yahoo let‚Äôs help yanggang yahoo pls
#####
Why are you posting this 2018 clip today? Click-hungry?
#####
this interview is more than 18 months old... whhhhhaa
#####
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for this guy üá∫üá∏üß¢

No dummy, the populism was inspired by Bernie Sanders. Jesus Christ the MSM suck.

I think Andrew was undressing Melanie with his eyes.  ;-)
#####
Andrew knows MATH. I can't wait for my data check in the mail. In YANG I trust ..
#####
Gotta drop the Zack Gooseman clips at the end. I‚Äôm sick of hearing him try to get me subscribed. IM ALREADY SUBSCRIBED!!! STOP OR ILL UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!
#####
Boy, Yang is the smart person.
#####
Old interview. Update  policy =UBI will be from age 18 until you die. Yahoo has had some of the most negative stories about Andrew Yang. This interview was straight down the middle which is likely why they never aired it. Now they put it on YouTube because he is so popular. You are jumping on the YangGang very late, Yahoo.
#####
Oh, Yang is definitely catching on!!!
#####
Why don‚Äôt you bring him in again rather than upload an old video?
#####
Yahoo should interview him again before they completely ignore him during 2019
#####
It cuts off at 64? FOH!
#####
Yahoo Finance has been biased against Yang, and hiding their dislike ratios on their videos by removing the old ones and re-uploading them over and over.
Disgusting how people can just go along with it, makes it easy to imagine how normal citizens in Germany went along with Hitler.
#####
Mike Jones voice - Back then they didn't want me now im hot they all on me.

Thanks alyssa I watched lots of Charmed when I was younger.

People need to ignore who will win but instead who will be best for our country instead.

Then we can get real leaders
#####
But she won't share her 10 million dollar net worth.

Why talk and comment about the candidates like you really know what's going on and yet have the audacity to say I don't think any of them becoming president..lol

Andrew Yang on digital data as personal property:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSOf0Eh-4dU
I have been saying this for years and to the "don't care" or "don't get it" attitudes from my friends, family members, neighbors, colleagues... and now, all of the sudden Yang is talking exactly what I've been advocating... Oh my!  The elephant in the room is finally get recognized and discussed.  The way to pay for this Freedom Dividend is exactly through this data driven economy.  Or, even if without the Freedom Dividend, but by passing laws to give people the rights to their digital data then they themselves can make the decisions on how to sell them and to who under strict government established guidelines, policies, and laws.  That move alone can make every citizen of this country has an automatic income right off the bat when they first born (or even before, because of their personal data as fetuses).
#####
Want to see what this looks like in real life?¬†

https://youtu.be/V6b5t-lFQ70¬†

https://youtu.be/P

Yang is the only one who has given 3 families the dividend out of his own pocket and his campaign gave to 10 families after the 3rd debate. He's literally putting his money where his mouth is. The money directly in the hands of Americans can go a long way. We are the shareholders of this country. We can afford to give a slice to every American over the age of 18.

I want to lick Alyssa all up !

Yikes, her career must be over and she is trying to stay relevant...

It's honestly satisfying to see America support good ideas and actual thinking rather than fanatism, this is the American the world trusted
#####
wow so many Yang supporters. I made a small donation to Yang and it was my first ever political donation. Yang is not perfect but he's at least very inspiring. I'm a scientist and I know what he's talking about.

I am a Bernie Supporter but Andrew is my second choice but with that said Ian also open to listen to other candidates and  will vote blue no matter who. Anyone is better than Trump.

UBI and VAT combination is a beautiful, elegant solution to many issues in the lives of many American. Society will literally transform for the better. If Andrew Yang gets elected and we pass UBI with VAT, 78% of all Americans will IMMEDIATELY see a change in their lives for the better. Currently 78% of Americans can't pay an unexpected $500 bill. I honestly did not know it was that bad here America but studies show that is the sad case. I was on the sidelines looking at Andrew Yang like a crazy person. When all along, I was the misinformed individual who didn't have a clear picture. I felt like things are going poorly and the state of the world is full of tension but until you see the numbers, it was just a feeling. Now, I know... I kind of wish I didn't...

Does 24k really take you out of poverty?? I don‚Äôt think so

Stacked bench? LOL
#####
Taking political advice from any of these hollywood clowns is a no go.
#####
Yang has no policy for the climate and avoids some of the most important issues, even if he has some good ideas. UBI is not enough. Bernie is the one who has changed American politics and is the only one who can make M4A and equality happen! Don't mess it up this time! Vote for Bernie! Stop living in the middle ages!
#####
Lol. Anyway Trump 2020 !!!!!!

The Democratic Party debates are to pick the biggest loser in November 2020. Will it be Pocahontas will it be Flanders or Yangalang. Maybe just maybe it will be Betomale.

Substantial .. impeach impeach and fighting over who‚Äôs giving away the most free things. Not any real issues were talked about , a bunch of pandering . It was nuts

Is there anyone left in the United States who doesn't feel that Pocahontas is a bald-faced liar? If so, they must have been focused on a rabbit-warren rather than Pocahontas Warren!

All these people saying "Yay, Yang!" You better actually go vote for him in the Democrat Party nominations!!!!

i like Bernie and yang

Alyssa Milano mentioned the Freedom Dividend as a way to pay Americans for their data, but I'm certain she's mistaken... The Freedom Dividend and Proprietary Data are two different policies Andrew is putting out there. We all already know the Freedom Dividend which will be funded by a VAT tax and give every American age 18 and over $1,000 a month of supplemented income. I know as someone who essentially lives paycheck to paycheck that, that would change my life for the better as I wouldn't need to fret over something like my car breaking down, and costs like that just keeps the money local supporting our own communities (collateral benefits). Andrew calls it capitalism where everybody doesn't start at zero. Our personal data is a separate policy that would make our data our proprietary right. Currently, our data is anonymous and convoluted. Imagine being in charge of your own personal data, answering questions that actually pertain to your interests and getting real value from it rather than algorithmic guesses on your interests. The companies that use this data would also get increased benefit because they'll know they're marketing to the correct people. Now imagine your data is also your right to sell. Andrew jokes about "who remembers receiving their data checks in the mail?" Well... maybe Andrew will get the chance to create an America that puts people first.
#####
Democrats always talk about income inequality why is that the worst income inequality is in libtards run states and cities.  If you believe Democrats are actually going to do anything for you.  Ask Dreamers . Democrats have had control of presidency and congress and did nothing for Dreamers. Democrats have never did anything uplifting for Blacks.  Democrats cities have epic homelessness and will not do anything to fix it. If you vote Democrat your a moron.  Trump has brought more people out of poverty than any president in history. That is a fact and the people he uplifted are women blacks and Hispanics.  Dont use fake news false narratives to decide your vote.  Use hard facts.  Lowest unemployment in our history for all groups of people.  Trump is a good president.  Trump actually cares about people.  Trump passed prison reforms that released thousands of blacks from prison , Democrats policies lock thousands of blacks up for petty crimes.  Trump has created healthcare for vets that exceeds anyone's expectations.  If Trump had a Congress that supported him America would be the best place on earth to bring up your children.  Vote Trump.  Vote on reality not unicorn utopia
#####
Yang 2020 all the way from Texas!
#####
I SUBSCRIBED because Alyssa Milano is smart!

Yang is helping everyone, Democratics, Republicans and others...we all use Google & technological social media!
#####
Stupid libtards haven't realized yet that they are living in MAGA country.
#####
And all of you folks chasing after Yang, you are only doing so because he is promising you free money..... Liberals are so predictable and simple minded. All you have to do to win over a liberal is promise them something free. Thank God the country is waking up. Trump is going to clean your clocks in 2020
#####
These people are so oblivious. When Trump obliterates them in 2020 they are going to be so shocked.... again... LOL

Alyssa Milano:  Who proudly told every one she had 2 abortions in one year because she wasn't ready to be a mom.  So she terminated the lives of 2 babies so she could just go on with her selfish happy D-rated acting life.  So glad though that went she got pregnant for the third and fourth time she felt she was ready to be a Mom and let the little ones live.  She's such a trooper!
#####
I endorse Andrew yang!! don't vote from your heart use your freaking brain Andrew yang is by far the best candidate #yang2020

The fact that you just let her say income equality is the biggest issue in America and no one said anything lolol I spit my coffee out
#####

Alyssa Milano? Automatic dislike for that.

The Yang Gang just keeps growing!

Stop worrying about "free money" Yang.... Trump will be winning 2020.

All of these women are so fake..... oh wait, so are all of their fans.


None of these women get along.
#####
Help us Whoopi, the media is blocking Yang
#####
Stupid cunts showcasing stupidity and congratulating each other for being stupid cunts.  Tulsi Gabbard is the only sane Democrat running.  Donald Trump won all the Democratic debates so far.  I  thought no one could be as pathetic a moderator as Lester Holt but there's Anderson Cooper killing it.  If the Democrats can't do better than this; four more years of Trump.  Which actually would be better than any of these clowns.   Hillary Rodham Clinton has certainly proven herself insane.  Don't go there for a candidate.
#####
all of you are witches
#####
Yawn...
#####
Andrew Yang is what Trump supporters wanted when they voted for Trump but got Trump instead.
#####
Bunch of rich folks trying to talk about poor/middle class.  wow!

The best debate so far.  Infrastructure and automation.  Allyssa Milano nails the issues.

A JOB GUARANTEE ( GOVERNMENT JOBS ) = BERNIE SANDERS OR A CAREER GUARANTEE ( IT'S YOURS - DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO DO ) = ANDREW YANG - Who ever you chose to be our next president is up to you America.

I have a weird question,
If something is sexist yet true,
Does it stop becoming true because it‚Äôs sexist?

There is no point pf the democratic debate trump is going to win

Love her !! BUT we should already know ! When you know what you want you know it! Yang gang !
#####
Alyssa did an outstanding interview with Yang that everyone should check out. She asked great questions.
#####
Primary in NY is 6 months away, but states like SC vote in February, therefore there is a sense of urgency for people to pay attention sooner rather than later depending on the state they live in.
#####
I'm pretty sure Putin would like Yang, perhaps not as a president of USA, but as a person.
#####
Andrew Yang is so much fun to hear. I want to hear more from him!
#####
God how dumb that is
#####
Was it not obvious that this dude was reading from a screen?
#####
He mentioned Hong Kong, I‚Äôm joining the yang gang YANG2020
#####
If were
Clawing into Russia‚Äôs interference we HAVE to address China‚Äôs too.
#####
How can you even consider one of the others?
#####
Yang Gang ! Oh yeah !!!!
#####
Andrew is my president because he is a visionary. I listen attentively because when he speaks I am granted the privilege of envisioning his America, MLKs America, ‚Äòthe other America.‚Äô Yang‚Äôs America is one I‚Äôd be willing to lay my life down for. Think about it, a country that takes care of its people. No means testing. No belittling. Just a father that wants the best for his children and his fellow countrymen. And no wealth tax! Haha

I‚Äôve never wanted to join the military for fear of a bureaucracy sending me to my impending death for no good reason. However, I really wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to sign up if my nation called on me under the leadership of Mr. Yang as commander-in-chief, believing he‚Äôd only put Americans in danger if it‚Äôs truly dire.
#####
..!. Putin .!..
#####
He is good but fake, he does not believe what he says. He is memorizing the scripts.
#####
Yang is so freaking charismatic! He would make a good President or VP to either Tulsi or Bernie
#####
Really?
#####
Who s this clown?
#####
Kudos to Ashley Parker for actually asking Andrew Yang questions. Overall the debate was a big flop. Tired of MSNBC ignoring Yang and others instead of giving everyone fair coverage.
#####
Sorry but I trust you as much as I can touch you to throw you...you take Phil Ting out of the california assembly..then I might cosider you as president...
#####
Andrew Yang is the only forward, smart and intelligent candidate of the bunch and MSNBC ignored him for 30 minutes.
#####
Being stupid and make fun of its own nation... Is that a professional journalism?
#####
Has anyone else noticed that Andrew Yang gets zero coverage on NBC?
#####
The United States meddles in more elections around the world than any other organized nation. At least the ruskies did it with memes and fake ads and not murdering thousands or leaving poor citizens in the hands of dictators and death squads. Stop blaming Russia for Hillary's loss.  If you want trump out, VOTE!!
#####
Andrew yang took a stupid question and answered it in a way that made it shine...  that‚Äôs Andrew Yang..  he‚Äôll take America forward into awesomeness... btw, he did not hesitate to call out China about Hong Kong...  even trump is afraid of calling out China on Hong Kong..   who else can be a leader like Yang to push America forward.

If you can't trust your own democracy, don't blame Putin, look to your own party!!! Many countries definitely don't trust American "democracy" having fallen victim t American warfare and bullying tactics.  America needs to respect Russia not feed its irrational phobia if it wants to be respected as a nation.

They desperately wanted to test him on the only thing he hasnt spoke much on.. war.

That was a solid gold answer.

Andrew Yang for President
#####
Why are they asking Yang such a dumb questions?
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Sorry for you, Putin doesn't give a shit ... You're not gonna win.

Hell yeah!

Crap question, great answer. This guy is absolutely brilliant. POTUS!
#####
Garbage question! Brilliant answer.
#####
Tweet their advertisers. We are advertiser banking to put it where it hurts. MSNBC pocketbooks.
#####
What kind of stupid question is that? Clearly they dont take Yang seriously. All the other questions they the other candidates are based on policies, but they ask Yang another stupid question.
#####
Andrew Yang turned an absolute joke of a question into a humorous moment while at the same time, bringing up tough issues and sharing innovative and forward-thinking solutions!
He is head and shoulders better than any other candidate on that stage!!

A pretty delusional wacky guy but hey, free money for everyone !

This is great, I'd watch every question you guys asked Yang individually but you guys seem to hate the guy.

This is our really president Andrew yang defending country's security. Never collusion such as Donald Trump
#####
He beat every candidates in the podium...
#####
Yang still thinks that Putin controls Trump? If so, Quid Pro Quo or not, Ukraine wouldn't have a darn cent! Obama gave blankets instead of "selling" weapons! Why? Because the $1 Billion aid went into a corrupt black hole and there was no money left for Ukraine to send back to the Military Industrial Complex for weapons. In a roundabout way, we the taxpayers fund the MIC.

Now the "businessman" Yang wants to appease the useless freeloader NATO countries? You know which nations you do business with? The ones who pay their tab! Estonia, Greece, Poland, Slovenia & UK. Every other NATO country is one who drinks the rounds but never buys a round. They're no better than Putin because he doesn't buy rounds either ... unless its ammunition rounds!

Anyway, the DNC and MSM will ensure Yang doesn't get the nomination so that "conversation" ain't never gonna happen.
#####
Is it just me or they just removed the "Everything Andrew Yang Said" earlier.  I watched it and liked it but for some reason, I can't find it anymore...
#####
NBC please banned msnbc for election meddling.
Are the two networks related? LOL
#####
this question is so bad, but Yang pulled it off.
#####
Awesome
#####
For all the Russians in the chat, Yang does not want war with Russia. He wants us both to end the proxy wars that waste money and focus on improving our own economies. There's a country south of you, that is going to be the global leader in AI and technology, while both our countries are busy fighting each other indirectly. We need to focus on that, not each other.
#####
Mr. Andrew Yang has my vote !
#####
Yang got jokes!
#####
They didn't give the Chinaman enough time all time was given to  Warren and Pervert uncle joe
#####
I love Yang... msnbc should be ashamed of themselves for such unfair coverage of Yang.
#####
Trump 2020 :)
#####
We don't need MORE government!
#####
They are all trying to meme so hard and coming off so cringeworthy
#####
man they didn't give yang any questions this whole time msn really doesn't like yang...
#####
Yang isn't winning
#####
Lmao these questions are almost as bad as the impeachment hearings
#####
These debates are just improv comedy shows with extra steps
#####
TULSI 2020: A VOICE OF REASON. 10:02
#####
I'm here to mass like every Yang comment.  AndrewYang2020.
#####
Ok, so... as of right now, Yang-Tulsi-Marriane. Aight <3
#####
Yang/Gabbard or Gabbard/Yang!!!! These candidates are amazing!!!!!!
#####
Andrew and Tulsi together isn't a coincidence
#####
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpS-QCbdTF4
#####
I noticed that Yang got the "fluff" questions about his favorite things, but Tulsi got the "word association" questions. Seemed like they were trying to catch Tulsi saying something bad about her fellow politicians, or have her give a descriptor that could be misinterpreted. It was very biased and shady IMO..... ü§î
#####
*üá∫üá∏Yang 2020üá∫üá∏* Spread his message
#####
I bet Joe Biden met Yang‚Äôs wife.  Probably didn‚Äôt know she was Yang‚Äôs wife.  üòÇ
#####
I like Yang and Gabbard.  But they get their ideas from Sanders.  Sanders already knows how to get shit done
#####
Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders, or this guy are the best candidate's.
#####
I like how this guy thinks.
#####
You can't take away gun's. That will make more money than the guy's selling gun's illegally. Putting more restrictions and making sure that the guy buying a gun is qualified to buy a gun is a better solution.
#####
its fucked up that you call him a virutally unknown. my point is where the fuck have you been? and the NRA is going down, SDNY is investigating them for fraud, FUCK the NRA
#####
Yang likes Biden and John McCain,yikes! Tulsi 2020
#####
Great to see Tulsi live, thanks for the interview!  The US invades only countries with oil, lithium or other rare natural resources, that our corporations immediately take.  There is no benevolence about it.  Just name one country that is better off today after US intervention!!!!
#####
Tulsi Gabbard needs to be the president of the United States of America if our country is to survive.,
#####
I like tulsi and Yang they are they refreshing and show we can have center politics without the extremes
#####
Lord when Yang wins the primary & team up with Tulsi & have Tulsi as his running mate for the main election, I WILL LOOSE MY SHIT!!!
#####
Yang is the solution for America!
#####
he makes sense
#####
I just spent a few minutes looking up the net worth of our Elected leaders................... Dem's and Republicans.  I can say one thing.  We need TERM LIMITS !  Every person we have been watching for the last couple months are "Career" politicians and are all millionaires.  Hell if I had known that those jobs paid that much I would have started running for office.
#####
üíô Tulsi.
#####
Lol tulsi being nice about all these candidates and then hillary comes up and 'warmonger'. LOL
#####
NO body istalking about other than Andrew young as NRA has a weak and so the reasons are very clear that the lobbiest and the money. So sorry.
#####
Any candidate not being smeared is suspect. That‚Äôs what our ‚Äúfree press‚Äù has become.
#####
If you want to get rid of gun violence in America then arm everyone. Taking guns from good law abiding citizens will leave guns in criminals hands and they will commit more crimes on unarmed citizens.
#####
Tulsi Gabard the next American president üíãüíñüíñüíñüíñüíãüíñüíãüíãüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíãüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíñüíãüíã

I just love you Tulsi. You are what we've been asking for! Thank you for going for it!
#####
$1K/mo will not solve U.S. Homeless but will reduce to 50%.  That will make more sense.
#####
Both got thrown out of debates, anyways got no talk time or decent questions, forget is, we re doomed. So called frontronner Biden is senile, corrupt neoliberal.
#####
Tulsi is soo fake typical Politician  #YANG2020
#####
ANDREW YANG FOR PRESIDENT. ALL CONGRESSMAN HAVE A PRICE ON THEIR HEAD AND TRUMP KNOWS IT.   LOBBYISTS HAS SEEN TO IT(LEGALIZE BRIBERY).  YANG FOR PRESIDENT!
#####
can't wait to see yang put his 1000 dollar a month bill before congress ....and they vote on it .....guess what's gonna happen ...a big fat NO...it's an unrealistic promise and he knows it which makes the promise a lie. 
Tulsi does not need congressional support to end wars withdraw troops and save and recoup trillions of dollars spent on war that can then be spent on medicare for all..
learn to recognize the realistic promises people
#####
American people need to understand they have an opportunity right now for real realistic progressive change and that opportunity is quite simply Tulsi Gabbard.
As an Irishman living in Ireland and looking in from the outside maybe I can see what so many involved people in America cannot see. The Democratic elite the political establishment do not want Tulsi and Americans really need to ask yourselves why?. 
If you agree with Tulsi you need to get behind her right now because she is only running once and that's it...she's offering you all an opportunity for real political change and prosperity and if you don't grab it by the horns she's gonna walk away from politics and I cannot blame her. 
she needs your help ...she's fighting a biased media and corpoeate elite who are trying so very hard to silence her . share her posts and do it over and over again...fill the Internet with her videos and messages and get her message out there now....this woman is genuine and a child could see that so get behind her have her back ....she's had yours for 16 years now.
#####
Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang are JFK reborn. They truly are candidates of a lifetime. I really admire them not just as intellectuals, but as people.
#####
Kamala: knee capped.
#####
Love Yang but can‚Äôt agree with his wanting to force 5G. Looking into Tulsi.
#####
More Yang on Fox!
#####
What do people see in Yang?  His basic income would drastically increase homelessness and would steal the work motivation from millions of Democrats.  It would be a disaster.
#####
Cuz that idiot in office has lots of foreign exp right...gtfoh
#####
Jesus said,  ‚Äú The poor will be with you always. ‚Äú
#####
It would be a lovely Beautiful Situation  if and when PRESIDENT Obama..Jayz .. Oprah ...and a few more important People Endorse Mr .Yang For PRESIDENT  that would really help us out
#####
Among the noteworthy politicians in Capitol Hill Tulsi Gabbard is one of my favourites. Her views on what America should and shouldn't do as a leading democracy resonates with my sentiments on foreign affairs and US policy on armed conflicts, specifically in Syria and Afghanistan. She strikes me as a very strong contender for the 2020 Presidential race. Of course Andrew Yang would make an ideal running mate for her.
#####
I'm YangGang. But I would be very content with Gabbard as president. I'd feel "ok" about a  Sanders presidency.

But any other establishment can candidate can go screw themselves.
#####
Sombody please make nacy pelosi step down mannshes already to dam rich to be fighting for the middle class so fuck her
#####
Gabbard is hot lol
#####
what she really wants to say in the name game, Dick / Creep / Bitch ect.. lol
#####
tulsi why should we both defeating al khida or isis theres evil in this world and its happening right here with the rampant poverty slave wages (paycheck to paycheck) mental health issues and most important to me low happiness
#####
Good message but leaving out main criminals that is reason for all problems
#####
Thank you for putting on Yang and Gabbard!!
#####
I'd pay higher Amazon prices in exchange for UBI/Freedom Dividend for everyone.
#####
It's only defamation if it's a lie....Hillary $$$$$ sucker.
#####
To many still believe in has-beens, Biden, Sanders old men that don't no when to walk away.
#####
Yang/Tulsi 2020 is the Dream Team
#####
I love Tulsi but to also get Trump's voters best be Yang head to head with Trump.
#####
i hope i have found a decent reporter, interviewer let em talk
#####
School or any other shootings is not a gun control issue.  The shootings will only be resolved when we begin to look at emotional health and wellbeing of all Americans.  Not take guns away from good responsible people.
#####
Lets see, in 2018 397 people were killed with rifles and over 1,500 were killed with knives and cutting instruments per FBI statistics...now, what the Dems going to do about those knives jumping out of the kitchen drawer and killing our children???  What ya gonna do about it Dems???  Ban knives across America?   You know that's going to stop it right?   Then what happens when hammers start killing our people????   Ban hammers????   So, next comes screw drivers.   Screw drivers are killing our people!   Ban Screw drivers...and the beat goes on....you dummies never figured out the puzzle did you...you geniuses don't even know the difference between a barrel shroud and a barrel roll.  Yep. Your stumped ain't you.
#####
Andrew Yang for President!
#####
Yulsi 2020
#####
Very pleasant interview
#####
Yang C-  vs  Tulsi A+
#####
So Yang thinks taxing Google Facebook and Amazon will pay for his proposal to give every American citizen $12,000 a year? I'm sorry but that doesn't sound sustainable at all. How long before American citizens are taxed to keep that program alive which would completely offset the money in the first place.
#####
Tulsi is obviously smart, tough and also she sure is easy on the eyes...
#####
Yang: President
Gabbard:VP
Sanders: Secretary of Education
#####
Yang Gang 2020 ! Oh yeah üíÉüíÉüèæüï∫üï∫üèΩ
#####
This guy literally buys votes lol #trump2020 #magatrump2020 and Tulsi is a commie
#####
A combination interview with my fav 2 candidates.  This they should do more!!
#####
These two both need way more coverage
#####
The banks & tech companies have been selling our info for big money & we don't see a dime. Vote Yang it's time to get paid
#####
Imagine an international crisis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are gathered in the Situation Room with US forces on alert all over the world, ready to pressure the president to take immediate military action. Who do you want to be sitting there as POTUS? Do you want someone with zero relevant experience... or do you want a Major with 17 years of experience including two tours in a combat zone, plus 7 years on the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Homeland Security committees? Who already knows most of the players? The idea of Buttigieg in that scenario is preposterous. I like Yang a lot, but he's clearly not qualified to be Commander in Chief by any stretch of the imagination. TULSI IS.
#####
"Trump" - orange, I was thinking of the same thing.
#####
Be good to get rid of the old criminal element of American politics. The likes of the bush and Clinton family are stalling the progression of human development with their archaic ideas and plans that are run just to further their own gain. There is no place in politics for these criminal family's. Vote tulsi for a better future for you and your children.
#####
Sanders/Gabbard 2020
#####
A yang/gabbard or a gabbard/yang ticket would be the greatest outcome by far. If they actually had the support of the dnc they would beat trump
#####
I would elect her solely on her military stance relative to all other candidates, but I've got to stick with Yang, and truly hope her foreign policy is implemented as his running mate
#####
Just want to say that this Alex guy is doing a great job
#####
Gabbard and Yang are the Dems best chance to beat trump.
#####
Democracy dollars, lobbyists will fight Andrew.  But what a great idea.
#####
Her answer on Beau Biden was revealing. I guess it would explain why she seems to go soft on Biden...especially the Hunter Biden thing.
#####
Seeing a democratic candidate on fox network having a cordial conversation.... this guy should be president lol
#####
finally Two Serious Dems Candidate‚Äôs for America .
#####
She is best
#####
Great interview with Yang and Gabbard, thanks Elex and Fox 11 news!
#####
I am YangGang I also really like Tulsi
#####
Throws the basketball completely misses and team cheers wildly..that‚Äôs the best representation of trumps presidency
#####
I seen that Oklahoma has had the biggest prisoner release in the nation, around 2,000 inmates were released. Reports say that the tax payers in Oklahoma will save 15 million dollars a year by not having those people incarcerated.
#####
A hindu and a chinese... what is wrong with white americans today, they seem to regard themselves as fools and retards.
A 1000 a month will make sure that homeless will forever be addicted to drugs and china taking over everything
#####
Gabbard's actual thoughts during the Name Game:
Biden: old
Clinton: bitch
Kamala: cop
#####
The zionists calling people 'anti-Semites' are already defaming those that disagree with the INSANITY of the INSANE that kill real people for living on land that a 'god' they invented GAVE that land only to those that invented the INSANE CLOWN the zionists and their newest JACKASS of the zionists, calls 'god'.

Yang!
#####
Mr.  Yang. You are super smart 
Great Answer 
This‚Äôs kind person we love to be our Persident 2020
What  are  intelligent guys
#####
Forget ubi.  That's never gonna get passed.  Lets focus on the rest of Yang's ideas.  At least he has intelligent, reasonable answers to every question.  Ain't no "I'm gonna hire the best people."  PFFFFT.
#####
#YangGang2020 all the way!
#####
Tulsi 2020!!
#####
Why the FUCK does FOX cover Yang better than MSNBC or CBS? For fuck's sake, #YangMediaBlackout needs to STOP!
#####
Did you ask and get an answer to 'HOW MUCH?' and 'FROM WHERE?' ?
Nope.
So, like 220 Million Americans get $1,000 / mo.
Isn't a Thousand Million .... A Billion ?
Is that not $220 BILLION / mo.
Then times 12 months.
Is that not $2.64 TRILLION Annually?


In FY 2018, Treasury collected a total of $3.4 Trillion in all tax and other revenues.
https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/government-financial-position-and-condition.html



Does that portend a tax increase of 76 Percent.
And, from WHERE.


Full disclosure.  Never been to college, so ..... Subject to Check.
#####
Wow, Tulsi is awesome!
#####
Can someone please tell me what would happen if these tech companies moved out of the U.S. and into countries with cheaper taxes? (Trying to convince my dad)
#####
Challenge Accepted!
#####
This man needs to win for the sake of the US.
#####
Better than the Debates. No finger pointing, bickering. This man just makes too much sense. Let see how America will fu** this up. This man is what America needs. C'mon America we can do it.
#####
He should had been president  yesterday!
#####
Actually, I listen to Andrew Yang's talks to learn about American Foreign Policy and lots of other important facts about running a country!!!  I don't know how someone can hold so much information in one brain!  He's a super problem solver and he WILL solve the problem of getting the "Freedom Dividend" through congress...... he will be successful in putting the money into our hands!!! yang2020
#####
My son is dropping out off college because of our incomes ... I will vote for yang .. hopefully it will helps my kids
#####
Great interview just didn't like the SAT part where he mentioned that 12 year olds take SAT's.  Only gifted children do that, normal people take it in high school junior or senior year. We're not all crazy smart and asian Yang.
#####
Math!
#####
people will give more to Charaties
#####
If they shut out Andrew from the next debate how about this: Yang goes on stage somewhere in front of a live audience, perhaps in the very same city as the debate, and he answers the questions the panel puts forward to each candidate and then he rebuttles each of their response. The whole thing would be streamed live and the entire world will get to see how he addresses problems and solves them.....one of the problems being, him not being allowed to enter the debate. 


What do you guys think?
#####
11.20
#####
Andrew Yang will put the Republican Party to great shame.  Yang is light years ahead of any  Republican    The Republican Party has been sleeping under a rock for many a centuries   Wake up America take back your country  go Yang!
#####
5000 up votes and 37 down. This candidate can unite our country. If you are registering for the first time as a Republican, please consider instead registering as an independent, so you can vote for Yang in the primary. If registered as a republican, you can re-register as an indie, and vote for Yang in the upcoming primary.  Yang is a win-win.
#####
YANG/HARRIS 2020
#####
Its wild to me that there are skeptics of Yang with the belief that "he is too nice and wont get anything done in office if he gets elected" when it is quite apparent he is a bigger man of action that any of the other candidates. He doesn't sit and wait for change, he has a track record of achieving! Other candidates have scoffed at his non-political background but I feel like that makes him feel more human than the others because he has put himself in our shoes and seen the hidden problems of our generation. Yang2020!!!
#####
Why not address single parents as a bad for children
especially people of color
that's why asian are doing better even than white people.
saying it systemic racism problem wont solve anything
I think yang is carefull to stay in ligne with the democrates agendas
#####
it's kind of impressive how much Andrew yang knows.  now being president he probably wont have the power to do everything he wants because of the left and right side clash but the direction and focus is definitely for the people.
#####
The Yang gang is so stupid.
#####
....Come on, confess! You voted Trump in 2016, and you're very sorry now!.... So be a **YINYANGS**2020! Don't vote Trump again, vote YANG!.... vote YINYANGS 2020....
....Join the YINYANGS, and the YANG GANG....Be a YINYANG!....we can always use more YINYANGS, and look what Trump did to his!....
#####
If we can get pewds to 100 mill let‚Äôs get yang for president yang gang
#####
After phone banking more than 100 calls, found out people either don't know Andrew or like him. That means anyone who knows Andrew will/ like him.
#####
Neoliberal solutions from neocons like Yang aren't a solution for anyone
 but the wealthy corprotists and the wealthy, centrists Democrat hacks 
of the DNC/DCCC that support trickle down lies and GOP policies.  Yang 
is a plant, a planed distraction against real progressive solutions can 
candidates.
#####
R.I.P. to my veteran homie Brandon Araiza who committed suicide
#####
When President Yang gets inaugurated, I will cry tears of joy. I will probably pass out! I would be so happy!
When President Obama got elected, I cried tears of joy and was so emotional because of what it meant in a historical and cultural context of this country.
With President Yang, it would be because of what it means for our FUTURE!
#####
Wow, who is this Yang guy?
#####
The idea of UBI giving the necessary security to young people to avoid abusive relationships and toxic dependencies was excellent. It will definitely resonate with a lot of people in similar situations.
And Mr. Future President - what's up with  hand - to pockets movement when you tell a joke lately ? It's cringing me out man :) 
Keep it real !
#####
Yang always say "do you know what i mean?"


Do you know what I am saying?
#####
He'd be a great HUD
#####
Kevin M - same here. Been watching Yang's speech over and over again for the last 5 months.
#####
Yang Yang Yang 
On the way to the White House
#####
I grew up having a really hard time understanding academics and politicians. Even with my undergrad, I just chalked it to me not being savvy enough to get it. Listening to Yang made me realize that my lack of understanding was just due to the obfuscation that people dish out to sound smart. Yang speaks clearly in plain language without trying to complicate my understanding. Great speaker, thanks Yang!
#####
Psychology dept in major hospitals doesn't treated the patients as the old time.  If  anyone have problems needed talk to a professionals,  These days, the psychologist gives you a pill instead, 
they no longer have time and resources talking to a person in mental, emotional trauma.  So the easiest way to treat the symptom is give you a pill for half of day or so.  That's why
we have heavy duty mental patients roaming around not able to be listened to but pops the pills.
#####
I fell very confident in his Leadership!  Trump LEAVE NOW! THERE IS NO NEED FOR YOU!
#####
I wish he was running as an independent both parties have a great deal of negative baggage.
#####
The stuff of life
#####
That fact about the SAT made my jaw drop
#####
LOVE THIS MAN. HELP US ANDREW YANG, YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.
#####
When did Biden, Warren sit with people and take random question?? None.. They have rehearsed questions..
#####
Andrew Yang is the CORRECT choice for president.  Hopefully more people will wake up and realize this.
#####
Yang S.C support
#####
Yang S.C support
#####
It's important to have someone who can actually think in a position of power.
#####
Humanity, pride and leaving a better world for our kids. He sounds so refreshing.
#####
Yang for life..
#####
Damn these questions are amazing.
#####
3 or 4 candidates should drop out right now and endorse Andrew Yang so Yang could get their votes and beat the old politicians of touchy Biden, old Sanders and Warren.
#####
Yang Gang for president 2üëå2üëå
#####
I like it when he picks the glass up to drink then postpone to drink :)  Talk about strong personal control.
#####
Yang beats Trump
#####
2:36 *Holds breath*. *Pause*. *Pause*. *Pause*. *Exhales*. "...Pheww...that was close...*
#####
I'm addicted to Yang's talks.
#####
Just finished watching this on my 3rd times probably.. lost count.
#####
Where can we find the UK version of this man?
#####
Watched the whole thing while playing 
GTA 5 online
#####
Hello Andrew, I remember that you advocate for psychologist in the White House.  You should pick Jordan Peterson.  It would be a force to be reckon with.
#####
I still have the same high like I hear the speech the first time, I'm 60. So stunning but so real. My kids said I'm so obsess about AY. Went through what we went through, as an American fellow, how can I not? AY is my and our president!!
#####
What a breath of fresh air
#####
The entire concept behind jails for profit is ... obviously sick.
#####
It's interesting how just a few months ago Andrew was saying that automation would be impacting truck driving jobs in the future.  But now the speech has changed to reflect the impact is happening now as UPS and others are testing self driving trucks.  Technology, automation, AI is moving faster than we can anticipate and the impact will be far more devastating for jobs than we are ready for.
#####
Please vote for this man üôèüò©
#####
Crime can be brought down over night with, Mr. Yang's, idea... here's how: If you stay out of trouble you get the money, but if you get into trouble, then you get locked-up, and you loose your grant for some specified amount of time... and you MUST finish high school, or maintain a specific G.P.A. ( grade point average ) Reward and punishment... Currently, the only reward is unfunded, with "Well your not locked up! "  as the reward; A little financing helps; hell OUR money goes to countries that DO NOT have OUR best welfare at heart! Speaking of "WELFARE" it is prescribed right there in the "Preamble of the U.S. Constitution"  " TO PROVIDE FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE!" Mr. Yang's approach will do this more directly than any of us alive Today, has ever seen...  The word " WELFARE" has been demonized big time by lots of U.S. lobbyists, and hatefully stingy crooks ( sociopaths ) posing as public servants!
#####
Mr. Yang's, consistency in his message, indicates that he is decisive in his ideas and decision making... Good sign!  When your story constantly changes you are either liar, or you are not decisive, or both...
#####
If, we can give, Israel, 3.8 Billion Dollars/ year for 10 years, and they can use part of that money to pay some of the U.S. congress people $15,000/ month to honor the N.D.A's ( None Disclosure Agreements ) signed by them, then we MUST pay every, American, citizen $1,000/month... as per, Mr. Yang's ideas.
#####
I am not a rabid trump supporter, but the free press need to be less money grubbing, and put,  Mr. Yang, on the tube to give him fare exposure to the people, unless what trump says about their honesty is true... Andrew Yang and Jimmy ( THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH ) McMillan, 2020!
#####
Plus, an overwhelmingly duly elected 'President Yang' would really humble/pee-off the Chinese government....Not to mention the Putin communist......(wait a minute...did he just say something like 'ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country!' ??)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...
#####
Andrew Yang, 'makes' me want to vote even way more than I did anyways...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...He's like a fresh version of the best of the other candidates, plus much of the best of the historical presidential-heroes of everyday people...You know, like FDR, JFK, LBJ, MLK Jr (well, not a president, but still feels like it), Honest Abe, Ike, Jefferson, Madison....AND, what we ALL need for the future that is really happening, not the one the right wingers keep forcing into our minds through their tv stations, religious and political positions of so much power........wow.....Still like all the dem-candidates...LOVE this guy!
#####
Mr yang for president 2020
#####
Please speak /insert yourself at the debates. There is no need to wait for questions. It is a debate in a way still- make it one- go for Bernie since it' s the same base and we all need your ideas, not those whose time has passed. Thank you for everything, Yang 2020
#####
Turns out the presidency campaign was scham! he was in it for the T-Shirt! :D
#####
I am tired of hearing about "men problems" my dude. Highest and increasing suicide rate, is not a man problem. Only gun violence and the fact that play video game(from you other interview) are.
#####
Yeah, Freedom Dividend!
#####
The boomer said paper towels jk xD
#####
31 people want to continue abusing women and dont want them to have the freedom to leave the abusive relationship

#####
Stole Bernie's line on bail, but he is really for it; well great!
#####
I found it a littlebit short, but ok, main thing is corperates need to pay taxes so goverment could provide for the public services and that is clean water, affortable modern infrastructure and also regulation in jobs, people should not be left alone.
#####
Actually gives a negative answer, a truthful answer. 

If only be could be the President. :(
#####
Yang needs to be a little more aggressive
#####
not american, just here to like the videos and comment so this guy gets more attention
#####
Hmmmm ...Liawatha Teepee fall down ... polls to low
#####
What is that woman going to do when her store closes up?

"Cry."
#####
I vote for Andrew because  I want to see trump stepdown  hashhahhaa
#####
A once in a lifetime candidate
#####
Wow a Democrat that actually answers a question, without bullying and using hate speech against the voter asking a question. Compared to Joe ‚Äúunhinged and angry‚Äù Biden.
#####
Yang is the DArk horse,  almost bet 15 to 1, vegas odds.
Practical, 
1. define the problem
2. study it.
3. and  most practical solution.  not political.
if he was white, i think Yang would be even higher chance of Potus status.
one thing i noticed, is that everyone he talks in front of They all like what he says and the way he says it.
real chance, once he gets beyond the second plat to.
#####
I support yang!
#####
The media only covers people with the most money... they‚Äôre getting paid. Just my theory on why he hasn‚Äôt got a lot of coverage.
#####
I love that Yang isn't ideological and I love that he always answers the questions. That's really refreshing. He's not here to pander or vilify anyone. He's here to solve problems for all of us.
#####
Yang 2020

Andrew Yang 2020!!!
#####
Ellen turns down the handshake 1:04 she prefer a hug, this  man must have  done something right
#####
Andrew yang really solves the problem. Life is getting harder everyday for the average American. AI and technology only benefits a subset of the people. Yet these tech companies are using loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Amazon and the likes are killing all the retailers and people are losing jobs. But they are pocketing and making some people hecka rich. But these rich people know how to play tax games and not paying fair share. We really need to implement what Andrew yang propose on universal basic income. And that money need to come from luxury VAT. Otherwise we will face societal problems getting worse. More Homeless people on the streets, more car thefts etc. these problems will exacerbate because people can no longer afford to make rents, have a job. Think about it people. Please I beg you. Even if we are not ready for an asian president, we really need to solve the problems with his proposed solutions. That‚Äôs the only way to go
#####
If I'm president I'd give everyone no questions asked $5,000 a month.

Ellen only invited Andrew to her show because of pressure from Yang Gang. She only interviewed BTS because there was so much commotion from the audience, she was not intending to interview them originally. She is such an ingenuous person. I really dislike her. So out of touch with reality. Seeming to help people out on her show, but it‚Äôs really just a self serving move. She wants to bask in people‚Äôs praises. It‚Äôs not that she actually cares for people.
#####
The akward handshake üòñ
#####
It's so frustrating to see Andrew on shows when there's no time to educate the public on policies. I'm bummed out! I went to his website & actually read his policies and they are amazing but how do we get other people to do this?
#####
"Bruce" Yang is Vatman, the freedom dividend crusader
#####
I'm shook; I thought it said drops-out

Hey Oprah  let's discuss inspiring figures ..like a virtual nobody who wasn't taken seriously declaring he wants to be President. Look at where Andrew is at .

1000 dollars a month 12000 a year. Sounds like government assistance. If you dont have to qualify and everyone gets it. I am for it

What I think is funny is none of the Medea is taking him seriously but all the other candidates have slowly started copying his policies and parroting what he has been saying for the last year.

Oh man I want Yang to feed me whip cream

Let‚Äôs go Yang! The only candidate for me

DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS FRUAD. Vote for someone more qualified, dignified and all around a much better candidate, Bernie Sanders.

What a freakin mass manipulation this is. I just lost interest in mankind in general, let alone ellen.
#####
andrew yang for china
#####
please america listen to this man
#####
Yang is not just representing America...look at his slogan...its for humanity...its the world that he cares about and he wants and cares to change the world...its a fresh start everyone...really take the time and listen to his message ...his goals and his vision for all of us...
#####
His healthcare plan is worse than Mayor Pete's....
#####
Some of these girls LOOOOOVVEEEE Ellen that one at the end was literally shaking... She sure knows how to make ermüí¢üòâ
#####
As a software engineer, I like that Yang understands that software dominates every part of our lives and many people don't really understand that. We need this type of president that understands this and that will prepare people for this and have a system implemented in place for this. People might think he's nuts but he is so right. We need forward-thinking politicians these days for our ever-evolving technology.
#####
Ever since Yang started talking at all I instinctively saw he was a corporate Trojan Horse Gig Economy, anti-progressive.
#####
As an overseas Chinese, I have a complex feeling about Andrew Yang's rise. On one hand, I wish him to win! Because I am an Asian. I feel proud if the US has its first Asian American President. On the other hand, I don't wish him to win. Because if he becomes the president, China'll get no chance in the game. He is spot on for way too many things! With other politicians, the US will win all the battles but eventually lose the war with China. If Andrew Yang becomes the president, I will have to believe that maybe God truly blesses America!
#####
Cool! Time to count how many people joined Yang Gang--assuming most Yang Gang have seen this video and the Joe Rogan show...
#####
An Asian president would be cool
#####
God I love me some Andrew Yang!
#####
Andrew opening his mouth while feeding the whipped cream is the best thing.
#####
his idea is worth attention
#####
Yang mind of a child
#####
Ellen reaction dosn't look so good. She should atleast giv 2-3 mins to let him speak i gurantee he dosn't need more than that.
#####
To get this great man a real shot of the presidency alot of regular people who are not politically active will have to get about championing him to everyone they know. I'm not American but I follow your politics very closely and his vision  is so important for the security of the entire world. If America fails, and it is faltering, we are all in trouble.
#####
I love you I want to come to your show but I dot have any excess to Come
#####
You know what's incredible about Andrew Yang? His message resonates with the sense of human life that was left out of the economy's one sided measuring system. I'm all the way in Africa in country called Botswana and I would vote for him, YANG GANG you better push this beacon of hope to the very top. Best of luck
#####
Contrary to optimization of capitalism, it‚Äôs scary to see how the ‚Äúpure electoral optimization‚Äù that package the candidates, not treating voters as humans, but ballots instead. Capitalism it‚Äôs based upon market competition, survival of the nations, or simply a reality check to the theorists. Dems have far gone into wearing the mask promoting social justice while outselling the country and making friends with the enemies.
#####
Here are my questions to Mr. Yang:

1) if the American dividend was implemented how would you protect against another boom since a population boom could happen one of two ways: excess child birth and increased immigration? 

2) At 300+ million Americans currently the stipend could total upwards of 300 billion, how would you regulate whether a person qualified for the stipend since a boom could have more economic effect on the federal budget than current programs and laws may not discriminate based on race alienate or nationality?

3) Technological advances are very important to society and provide many benefits, however data privacy concerns arise as technology grows. What plans do you have for protecting private citizen data as it travels through the internet and what changes would you advocate to strengthen any protections that currently exist?
#####
IOWA tonight is the night. if ever you wanted to make a difference , felt your vote didnt count...caucus for andrew yang!  trump supporters, i want you to think about this...you can register as democrat, caucus for Andrew yang and change  back the next day in iowa. why would you do this? to influence who trump faces, to have a  say in who is elected should he lose re-election. its win win. to everyone else i say support who you like but in my opinion Yang is the guy with his finger on the pulse of the coming upheaval the tech revolution is going to bring. have fun guys!

What do  some Yanks see in Biden, Warren and even Sanders ? 
Biden has no plans. He want to turn coal miners into coders.  Warren lies and shows ignorance of the real issues of why people are losing their jobs and Sanders has half-baked plans with his  job guarantee and wealth tax.  
US has too many old frt politicians who have outlive their usefulness. It is  time for a term limit to get rid of all these old frts.
#####
This  guy is a super genius
#####
Andrew Yang has it right UBI but he is not the only ones to back this concept. It may surprise you to learn that the Federal Reserve and it was discussed at the at the bilderberg group by Guy Standing. If was discussed there the infamous secret meeting of the world elite, then you can count on it coming to fruition.

When economist Guy Standing first advocated a universal basic income (UBI) ‚Äì a regular unconditional sum paid to all adults regardless of employment status ‚Äì he was considered quixotic (where quixotic is a synonym for ‚Äúa crackpot‚Äù). When his book The Precariat ‚Äì which identified an emerging class of people whose lives were diminished by short-term and zero hours contracts ‚Äì was published in 2011.
Guy Standing ted talk about UBI is needed:

Check out the linked article below:
https://thegreatworkdecoded.com/knowledge-base/universal-basic-income/
#####
I figure there will be a time in the future where the debate will on HOW MUCH to increase the UBI and not IF we should have one. Yang is just ahead of the curve right now. And one day we will all read it in the books that Yang championed an old idea (Dr. MLK) and won the elections. üòäüëçüèº

Andrew Yang is the ONLY man with a plan to abolish Income Tax. AND, the only candidate that shared all of his policy plans for the world to scrutinize BEFORE serving. World loves his brilliance!

A real contrast to Trump promising to share his plans AFTER serving. His only plan was to increase government spending to increase GDP to say the economy is growing, by pointing at GDP and ignoring debt.
#####
We need a normal human being as President. The rest are coo coos.  Freedom dividend for working class living paycheck to paycheck and disabled people getting government money, both are the same.  Both put money back in to economy and both can live a little better, reducing stress.
#####
Love for Yang to have the opportunity to explain his proposed policies that would ultimately benefit ALL Americans instead of just a few.  My vote in 2020 goes to Andrew Yang!
#####
Just heard of him today...ü§©  now binge watching all his interview videos!
Wise man with a heart‚ù£  hope he wins!üôè
#####
Awwww shiet a smart President? Something we need.
#####
Andrew Yang just wants to help people and this interviewer is trying to convince him not to lol smh
#####
I'm sorry but the fact that he is wearing a "math" pin is absolutely hilarious.
#####
Can you guys give me American citizenship so I can vote for Yang too?
#####
Yang, Don't laugh, you look like a fool. That's a stupid laugh.
#####
Hey, there's still some problems. If I had a green card in america, can I send half of this money to my mommy in China?
#####
IMO, the biggest positive of UBI will be the strengthening of American values and will catalyze creativity in our country. 
Think of it at the most basic level, most people with children want to spend more time with their kids and be positive influences but the constant boot on our throats from bills prevents us from going to our kids little league games, helping them with school, riding bikes around the neighborhood together. UBI would strengthen our families bc we wouldn‚Äôt be so stressed about next months rent. 
A stressed household absolutely has an effect on a growing child. Stress from bills can create domestic violence, alcoholism, drug use, etc to escape this vicious circle we have created under our current system of life. UBI will fundamentally let Americans finally pursue things they hold more dear to them and thus will create a happier, less stressed, and equal society.
#####
Everytime I hear Andrew Yang talk,  he sounds like our President. Everytime I hear Biden, Warren, and Pete Buttgay talk, they sounds like dumb dumbs with no real visions how to help the poor, average Americans. Yang2020

Only it isnt a dividend.¬† It is a redistribution of wealth - primarily from the upper and middle class - that will be funded by a VAT - which is a tax on consumers, not on businesses.

Dont want to feel like your efforts are under valued by the economy? 

Then find a way to make your efforts valuable.

Dont expect people to pay you to clean your own house and raise your own kids.

There is a guy on YouTube who made a 7 minute video that earned him $33,000.00 in ad revenues in one year.

UBI will pay for the drugs of millions of addicts escaping the mediocrity and pain of their lives.
Choice #1:   Work hard, struggle, sweat, to get skills to compete in a ever more difficult job market using robots and computers.
Choice #2:    Use UBI income to run away to the forest, live basic life and save money in the bank.
Choice #3:   Become a drug addict all expenses paid.
   You know the people and the choices they will make.   Its obvious.
#####
Automation is no joke you guys, it is seriously going to wipe out so many jobs. This is only the beginning. I really think this guy is good for the future of our economy.
#####
Simplified rationale of Yang‚Äôs UBI : our personal data is universally monetized. Yet we have no monetization personally. UBI would allow us to monetize what is being harvested by organizations.
#####
"Human Centered Capitalism" is another way to say "Socialism">¬† Yang is a left wing nut job!¬† Glad his support is under water
#####
Notice yang loves Alaska as his utopia? He lies about it every day. Alaska is cutting the oil payments ( it has nothing to do with UBI). Yang is a coward like all the other 2020 democrats. https://youtu.be/VtBt2OSL2Mw

I hate to break it too you, but his math sucks, his assumptions are wrong, his outcomes are false etc. ubi just failed in Ontario and Finland. You cannot tax your way to wealth democrats. Socialists etc. https://youtu.be/VtBt2OSL2Mw

Facts that show how effective the $1000 Freedom Dividend can really be a game changer for majority of Americans: 

1. 4 in 10, that's 40% of Americans can't cover a $400 emergency expense. https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html 
2. An average American household has over $8,000 credit card debt. https://fortune.com/2018/12/10/american-household-credit-card-debt/ 

3. 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck by paycheck. https://thedailycoin.org/2019/01/10/78-percent-of-americans-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-including-many-government-workers-affected-by-the-shutdown/ 

4. 1 in 4 Americans have student loan debt, i.e. approximately 44.7 Million people. Average student loan debt amount = $37,172. Average student loan payment = $393/month. https://www.nitrocollege.com/research/average-student-loan-debt 

5. Successful dividend program has been implemented in Alaska with oil money since 1982. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/13/16997188/alaska-basic-income-permanent-fund-oil-revenue-study 

6. Dividend from the nation's wealth is not only for the poor but for all citizens, and that would make it a true dividend and not a government handout or a social program for the poor... and therefore, not stigmatized the funding. People who don't need the dividend can always donate their shares to charities of their choices, or others causes with their humanity and altruistic desires, and this has been proving with positive effects in the society in general and specifically in the case of Alaska. 

Freedom Dividend - Humanity First - Andrew Yang 2020 and Beyond.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT A LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMY STUPID‚Äù

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
By Mountainview2.CA
It's interesting don‚Äôt you think, that other democratic presidential candidates (except Andrew Yang) are promising to adhere to the ‚ÄòManufacturing Consent‚Äô of incremental (business as usual) bureaucratic government-control over the economic self-determination of trickle-up capitalism of local (i.e., Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic-American) community-based free-market economies. On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  


Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users (or community citizens), the interactions between the users (community citizens) and a coordinating system (of leadership; Mayor, Etc.), and the required (overall) behavior within a system (Trickle-up economic strategy) in satisfying these goals. 


Use Case Model for Trickle-up Community-based Capitalism:
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 


Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.


Economic Prognosis: 
Date: April 1, 2021, Trickle-up Appalachian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American economic self-determination (based on humanitarian capitalism) is rolled out across the nation. 

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
I like thoughtful  leaders. Even if I disagree with them.  Mr, Yang seems to have command of his ideas, and the ability to articulate them in a understandable way. Intelligence needs to be appreciated  so much more in this country. We went from Black to white, let try going from dim-wit to thoughtful.
#####
Capitalism isn't "immoral," it's "amoral."
#####
*I was just wondering if...*
(-VP- Mike Pence) is related to the founder Thomas Pence?
#####
He needs to be more critical of Socialism.
#####
Capitalism with a human face? Doesn't exist. It's a fraud. Capitalism, by definition, cares about making money circulate, like a vortex. This is why finance exists, so that money can circulate without the need of any substantial happening. But if someone loses a bet in finance at Wall Street, a million of people loses their job on the other side of the world. That's capitalism, it always has been so an it always be. 
If you care about working people, for the people who actually make your country rich - vote for Sanders <3
#####
I‚Äôm voting for Yang not because UBI I‚Äôm voting for Yang because he smart,  he cares about automation and the future of our kids
#####
He's got my vote
#####
The problem with Yang is that he is running for the wrong party. He has too little appeal to the hard democratic base, and his policies regarding AI, China and privacy would very much suit the republican party. In a 1 on 1 primary battle with Trump, I feel like he could win over a lot of the young voters on the republican side. He is being drowned out amongst a sea of democrats on the left.

08:14 I'm sorry, I thought USA's motto was "Freedom" not "Arbeit macht frei". When did even socialists start demanding that everyone needs to work to survive, to feed themselves and pay the bills.. etc The UBI gives you true freedom. $12K/year covers the basics: food, rent, bills... it takes the edge off, enough to survive. If you wanted anything extra, the luxuries: a holiday, fancy gadgets, then you will have to work for it - the way it should be.

This isn't capitalism, its called communism/socialism.

watch out for inflation when you applied this UBI

UBI, if financed only by VAT, is a balanced-budget income redistribution mechanism that costs the government nothing for a closed economy. UBI 
like water flow in a pool comes out of one course and then returns back to the other but the level of water stays steady. It levels the playfield for sure and makes the economy sustainable. UBI, if not this time, will eventually be implemented.

More manufacturing jobs have been lost from outsourcing overseas ever since 2001 when China joined the WTO. 4 million in fact. Also, 8 million jobs are taken away from Americans right now from illegal immigrants. Yang is talking about a false flag when the problem is already here. Germany has twice as many industrial robots as the US yet manufacturing supporters 1 out of every 4 German jobs. To surmise, the problem isn't automation, its outsourcing and illegal immigration. Corporate greed wins from both, the American workers loses.

I like the universal basic income but not for very wealthy people. Wonderful idea as long as we do not have new and increasing jobs and industries, rental income assistance, etc. UNTIL we address these, the income is needed. It would decrease the overuse of government programs too. Good point about stopping the gaming of the US tax system. For welfare, how can we guarantee parents will spend money on their children.

#####
...Watching these Youtube vids, I feel like Yang answering questions and providing solutions just adds more fuel to the fire for someone to fire back at him. It's as if everyone that asks him questions feels like they know better than him on certain topics and just want to prove their point to him...at least that's the vibe I get from some people asking him questions...or I'm just being cynical. It makes it feel almost as if spouting ideologies is better than solutions based on data or extrapolations because at the least on a philosophical scale people can more easily agree on the same moral compass than critical thinking (probably because not many people use critical thinking?).
#####
universal basic income for everyone entering the land for legalized slavery... Who pays for it, GOVERNMENT? Who pays the GOVERNMENT through their taxes? OH YEH! NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS that they are HIRING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AT YOUR EXPENSE to KILL who ever is HERE!

Money isn't like water in a balloon. It's not a limited quantity. And it's not tangible. It's just a right to purchase. Today if we flood the economy with rights to purchase, then prices will go up. Inflation. But in the United States with our wonderful government spying on us, like the NSA, they know exactly what has been purchased and sold for years. Everything with a UPC bar code. With that information and with our current computer technology we can pass legislation to halt increases in prices and have it work. It's that simple. But then you would have shortages on some items. That would be solved with stepped up production to handle demand. So.... putting several thousand or more in everybody's bank account would be great. Where would it come from is your next question? It doesn't have to come from anywhere. It's just a right, not a limited quantity of green paper bills. ......... So to repeat... the excuse economists mostly give for not flooding the economy with money is it would cause inflation. Which means the value of the dollar would drop. But if we can stop rising prices, which we now can, then the extra money would be just fine. It would end the poverty class. Just require every able bodied person to work. The other reasons against a universal basic income are totally selfish exclusionary ones. And what is this stupid belief that government bodies need to collect taxes to pay bills. This baloney came from the middle ages where the lord required his peasants to give him stuff and in return he would protect them with his small well fed army. Turns out the army was actually a tool to dominate the masses. So why collect taxes when we can just push a button and put several thousand or more in everybody's bank account?

This was a fascinating and immersive conversation that presented a lot of relevant issues to the light for analysis. I was thoroughly intrigued the entire time! Thanks to this discussion, I now have a much clearer and better understanding of Andrew Yang's plans as president! He definitely proves himself as the one possessing the brainpower needed to advance this country not just on a short-term basis, but for the long run as well! I am looking forward to supporting him in the primaries! Ace it Andrew! #Andrew2020
#####
Regarding ALASKA's Permanent Fund Yang always references.  Let's start with Alaska's population - 731,550 people.  How does Alaska generate money for the UBI?  They get it from Oil Revenues. Why do you think countries like Saudi Arabia generate so much revenue?   Now spread the money taken from one of the most profit generating industry's in the world and distribute to a market that 327 million people in the USA consume - you're generating A LOT of money for a very small population.   NOW, let's factor in that Alaska has the lowest taxes in the country. There are no statewide income or sales taxes.  This is not the same as his VAT scenario he astonishingly proposes is equivalent!  If I lived in Alaska, I would have an additional $500 take-home due to tax reductions as compared to the shite state of Illinois (not including the ridiculously high, incidental taxes such as property and sales tax which makes the $500 more like $1000).  I would prefer to have my bottom line increased by reducing my cost of living, which includes limiting taxes.  I don't want a government hand out - I just want to keep more of the money that I have earned!  We cannot tax ourselves into prosperity - IT DOESN'T WORK
#####
Yang really needs to explain how taxing every aspect of the supply chain is not going to drive business expenses up ultimately 1) driving the prices of VAT and non-VAT taxable goods up on consumers (and how the government can even control this!) 2) Makes it more challenging for a business to get started due to the additional VAT taxation 3) does not cause a "serpent eating it's tail" situation, which will over time induce unhealthy levels of inflation.  He only says that the government printed 4 trillion dollars and it didn't hurt the economy - that's because the economy was on it's knees in deflation and the federal reserve needed to inject a healthy level of inflation to balance the economy out again.  I'm not buying his brief and witty explanations.  I want to see the long form "MATH".  Additionally, I want to hear his explanation as to why governments in Europe haven't introduced the UBI across a much smaller homogeneous state.  I lived in Germany for 3 years, and the price of common goods was very well controlled but wages and income were also very low relative to the USA.  There are starkly different cultural differences which includes LESS GREED, in countries like Germany hence they are willing to give up minor levels of personal income for additional taxation if they feel it generates a healthier community.  This is not how the US Culture works, hence we will need a major cultural change before we introduce potentially devastating forms of taxation in effort to produce prosperity.  Roman and Chinese Empires failed when they attempted this also.
#####
He‚Äôs so relaxed and has all his facts straight, he always has an answer with statistics prepared
#####
Unless I misunderstand him, he is wrong on VAT. VAT is a tax on the consumer, not on the production. Companies have ingoing and outgoing VAT. That‚Äôs the whole point. Companies that ate not included in VAT will not have any deductions of course, but otherwise it is all on the final consumer.
#####
So he adds a VAT and taxes even more (cars, electronics,  furniture,  etc). The $1,000 he gives would seem like pennies or a negative after the cost of goods skyrockets as companies pass all the taxes to the consumer.  Once again, lower and middle class take the big hit. Only fix is reform tax code. Get rid of exemptions. Maybe a flat tax. High income, high tax. Low income, low to no tax. No exemptions for individuals or corporations.

What i would do with the freedom dividend? Go to college, open my own mechanics shop, fix my tiny broken down house, especially fix the heat in this house im running off space heaters in the winters of MInnesota, go to the doctor that I cant afford, buy groceries, fix my car. There is sooo many positive things I would do with it. I could actually feel like i can start a family. But with no saftey net im scared. Scared to lose my job, scared to get injured outside of work, scared to get sick, scared my car will break down, scared i cant afford to eat, im just all around scared. I lost everything last year because I was laid off. This would change my life. 

Everything he says gives me hope. Hope to live again. Yang 2020. Lets make this happen!

Renewable energy is a joke when compared to nuclear power.

I'm with Yang on thorium. 

Since we cant rely upon a former bartender - AOC -  to do the necessary research required for an informed opinion.¬† Here are the highlights.

"While Germany has deployed some of the most solar and wind in the world, its emissions have been flat for a decade while its electricity has become the second most expensive in Europe."

"The dilute nature of water, sunlight, and wind means that at least 450 times more land and 10 ‚Äì 15 times more concrete, cement, steel, and glass, are required than for nuclear plants."

"solar panels create 200 ‚Äì 300 times more hazardous waste than nuclear, "

"the huge amounts of land required for solar and wind production has had a devastating impact on rare and threatened desert tortoises, bats, and eagles "

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/08/we-dont-need-solar-and-wind-to-save-the-climate-and-its-a-good-thing-too/#98ca35be4de1

this makes since a lot of since we pay  taxes the wealthy, pay lower if any taxes so the thing is with this it would give people some breathing room to do more then  just get by .
#####
As your northern neighbor,  I really hope he gets elected. He won't,  that would make too much sense.
#####
I'd like if someone would throw time into the equation to Mr Yang when it comes to nuclear.
20 years it takes to build a modern nuclear reactor.  Solar is becoming cheaper and cheaper and a lot easier to implement now.
 If climate change is so urgent, isn't solar power with pumped storage a more viable solution then the pipedream of fusion (ITER) and Thorium (MFSR)
And supply.
Where is the fuel coming from?  Last time I checked, there isn't really an open market for nuclear materials easily tradable worldwide.
And then there is murphy's law.
When there is a chance of something happening, given enough time, it will happen.
Fukushima is a $500Bn disaster and still counting in one of the most technologically advanced country in the world.
If it can happen there it can happen in the USA aswell.
The nuclear waste thing is a pretty much non issue, there is already a solution for that, it's just lacking in political will and strength to make it happen.

Loved the talk, thought I'd share my critiques of the aspects that concern me as I've looked into them.
#####
I appreciate the scholarly research he has done to help create his straightforward agenda. All questions are answered directly, without any dodging, and are easily understood. This is the kind of level-headed person we need to lead this country in these times. He truly understands today's problems.
#####
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. For decades Thorium research has been going on to fuelize it, not only in India but other parts of the world. No headway. Giving a filip to Solar and subsidies for Solar Homes as India does or turning all Govt offices to solar would be a head start. And dump the straw. 

Respected Yang didn't answer how he would make sure that the VAT would not be offloaded to customers by the corporates. Which is what eventually will happen.

Andrew Yang's idea to use a VAT tax to stabilize our transitioning economy has great merit.  Also climate change with extreme weather events is hard to deny as it is in our face. CO2 is also rising as measured in the atmosphere. Pollution is, ecologically, a runaway train. All need to be addressed, however, the sun has 11 year cycles in which the sunspot count indicates whether our sun's energy will be warming or cooling our planet.  Upcoming solar cycles 25-27 are projected to usher in a prolonged cooling trend which is most dangerous to our grain growing zones. Consider the most recent Maunder and Dalton Minimums. Certainly a catastrophic event is upon us where we can help our communities and selves the most by learning to grow some of own food. The government cannot do it all.
#####
Imagine this: people getting an extra $1000 a month being able to work part time due to the increase in income. Part time employees don't usually get benefits at companies, saving them money. This would take additional strain off the insurance industry, which would in turn lower prices there as the market becomes more competitive. It would become more competitive due to more people who can now afford to buy their own health insurance without employer assistance. It's almost like using the insurance companies' own business model against them in order to lower prices. Healthcare overall should also improve, as doctors and nurses can focus more on actual treatments rather than paperwork.

I am 63 and as a kid I watched a cartoon where George Jetson went to work to push a button that would start the machines working. He was the only human employee other than his boss. Then I read science fiction where technology "freed mankind for higher pursuits."  My question was how do we get from here to there because I never heard of an employer that sent workers displaced by technology with any kind of freedom to pursue higher activities. For a while, tech created jobs but that begins to fade as technology learns to design & repair itself and do it better than we could. I have spent a lifetime thinking about these things and would love discussing them with Andrew Yang. The biggest problem I have is that people I know would listen to about 5 minutes of this interview and say, "Let's go get donuts" and be through with it. When I taste an Impossible Whopper and tell the cashier that this burger could save the world by letting people transition painlessly away from beef (if the price got reduced ... which just happened) and the woman said she wouldn't give up beef no matter what. I asked if it meant that her children would have a livable environment in the future, would she eat plants that tasted like beef instead of beef, she answered, "NO !!!" Conversations like that make me feel like we are doomed.

I am all for Andrew Yang, but he avoided answering the definition of VAT, where all consumption including private consumption means that every item becomes more costly to buy. In Sweden where I am from, we have a 12.5-25% (25% typically) VAT on every single thing we buy. That means mathematically, that (if the same VAT percentage where applied, those 1000 usd / months in the end amounts to 750 usd / month. Well at least if you discount all other effects that might occur when and if VAT is implemented. Again a simple calculation like that, does not mean much. But Andrew clearly focused on the Corporate end when he answered to tactically give light to that part instead of the private. Again, there are economical reasons for focusing on that aswell, but those aspects is never brought up.
#####
Democrats are such idealists that they can't actually select a candidate and so they just go with whoever is popular. Republicans are the opposite. That is how they won. That is how they elected an outsider. Nowadays if you go with an insider you will get someone neck deep in corruption like Hillary and they will be destroyed by Trump and populism. The democrats are doomed.

Why are people so obsessed with tackling inequality? In reality, a lot of problems related to inequality are just illusions. Only freedom and rule of law are true and real. Democracy and equality are just genuine simple hopes people have in life. On the surface, 1000$ dividend will not shrink the gap between and poor, because 12000$ a year for the top 1% or even 20%of the population is just a tiny proportion of their make annual income made. What will happen if the bottom 1% or 10% of the population do if they receive 1000$ a year by doing nothing. 1st, people will get lazy. 2nd, A major reason people get strangled in poverty  is that they get trapped in a behavior pattern in which they can never save and invest for their future. So if you give them 1000$, they will most likely just wasted on immediate purchase and cheap enjoyments. They WILL NOT save and invest on education or future career. It is more effective and wise to assist people by teaching them how to earn money than simply giving out money to them. What they need is a mechanism that can help to lift them out of vicious circle of not making ends meet. welfare to this extent will only jeopardize people‚Äôs willingness of creation and entrepreneurship. Taking a toll on the incentives for doing small businesses is BAD.   This alleged ‚Äú freedom dividend‚Äù will trigger the switch of a pandora box that will be turned on every time people thinks that the inequality gap is big too big.  We have be precautious about people‚Äôs kind wishes, because a lot of the times, they end up becoming disasters in society.  Reading some authentic economic books are essential...

The problem with VAT is that only the end-consumer pays the tax and not the big bad corporation. So it's just an extra tax for the people. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6RB4rIxWqI

What people don't seem to understand is even if your current job is lost, the 1000 dollar a month is an AMAZING FUND to help you stay afloat and transition to another job.  That floating 1000 supplements most basic necessities and organizations that would form to assist those specific transitions would be an even greater help.  Andrew made the perfect statement, its a FLOOR to build up from there, not THE solution.

Another answer to this question, presented at 34:51, I remember watching a documentary about food insecurity and families that work nonstop to pay for the bare necessities (rent, utilities, transportation, food). There was a single mother that relied heavily on food stamps to attain groceries. However, when she finally managed to get a new and proper paying job, she could not afford those stamps anymore. But the punchline was that she barely went above the maximum income limit for food stamps. She ended up quitting her job and returning to the hectic schedule because she needed those food stamps. The threshold keeps individuals trapped in this cycle of poverty.

I don't think a freedom dividend or UBI would address inequities. But if one has a question about HUD or Education - those are separate to the UBI. I have seen that a private company wants to build a building complex and include in the design a certain percentage of homes for low income families. Those plans cannot get approved by the local council. If the federal government worked with the state and local governments to get low income homes included in designs of buildings... but we always get into the fight between state rights and federal rights and local government rights. Same goes with schools. It is a challenge... but something that needs addressing... like making federal funding of housing and schools dependant on addressing inequality. But the UBI policy won't do that for us. UBI addresses personal freedoms.

The biggest problem with Yang is that he is pro Nuclear energy.  No way!  With the environment being more and more unstable:  more earthquakes, fires, floods, droughts, tsunamis, etc., we cannot afford the risk: NO NUCLEAR!

Perhaps if he dropped nuclear and teamed up with Sanders.
#####
Conan please invite Andrew Yang!!!!!
#####
Honestly my hand is getting tired from thumb's upping every single comment in the thread...Yang 2020!
#####
When is Yang going to be on Conan?!
#####
No one watched it because people watch Netflix and YouTube nowadays. The debates get recognition on our popular social media websites not age old television programming.
#####
YANG GANG MATH 2020
#####
I consider myself an independent voter.... Of all the dem candidates, I really like Andrew Yang's well articulated and intelligent explanation of why the UBI plan for all legal American citizens (over the age of 18) is the way to go to preserve and ensure America's flourishing future....  But I don't like Yang's stance on abortion (he's for it) and wanting open borders among other key important issues. I sure wish POTUS45 would put all Americans 1st by investing in her citizens and implement a freedom dividend (UBI)! üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏ .. if the $ was put back into the hands of the citizens,  there will be less "MISmanagement" of welfare money by gov workers (with the freedom dividend most welfare programs can be ended),  A UBI would save US taxpayer billions of $$$ as just a dividend of $1k a month,  most poor would not feel desperate and go to drugs, prostitution or theft to get $ for the basic necessities. And Prisons would be less likely to hold as many people as the UBI will help sustain them. Another better idea,  is to buy land with apartment style buildings on them and let the poor and homeless live in them and self regulate their community. Ban drugs and if they are found to have drugs will lose their apartment, unless they can clean up. These apartments will be free for the poor under a certain income as long as they abide by clean (no drugs, no violence) rules. Then turn the community in a non-profit and ask for donations and support. But key is to have the property of the apartment building or tiny home with zero taxes (paid in full)  and eventually allow the residents to own the little home or apartment.
#####
Trump 2020, UBI is foolish. "Enacting a UBI that pays $US10,000 to every US adult would distribute about $US2.5 trillion in benefits each year. That‚Äôs roughly 75% of the federal government‚Äôs 2018 revenues. To fund a UBI program of this size, Congress would need to pass massive tax increases or spending cuts.

Some proponents of UBI would fund the program, at least in part, by disbanding existing safety-net programs. This would be a disaster."
#####
If we are going to give yang a platform....how about we start exposing him for being an imposter.  He is not a progressive.  He doesn't deserve to be on a democratic ticket. He is a mild mannered trump. He holds no values that real progressives care about. He throws out empty slogans that progressive use while pandering to corporations dismantling any hope for the poor and marginalized communities.  His ideas are not new. They are conservative statistics quo, corporations over ppl. He just wraps them up in progressive slogans. His words are empty. Aoc is truly validated calling his UBI scam a trojan horse. His ideas are trumps America as they are today only he wants to eradicate government assistance for the poor to give people a $1000. Who will pay for that?? Poor.  It's not fresh and new to feed the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  Its regressive the complete opposite of progressive.
#####
Just like the debates, only one sentence of this whole video was related to yang
#####
We gotta spank every trump live stream!!!! We have to keep it moving!!!
#####
Thank you Conan for being respectful to all people even when you joke about them. You are truly my favourite comedian and human role model. I don't think you will ever loose currency and relevance with your audience as long as you keep being the person you are now.

the fact that yang is in the title isn't coincidental--their research must be showing that he's the biggest draw for views which likely means he's doing better than the media would have you believe.

The reason no one saw the debate is cause we're all too damn busy working our asses off to stay alive. I think capitalism is definitely our current best system, but it has been deteriorating lately and is at risk of becoming either fascist or communistic; neither of these options have been beneficial if we're going by the books of history.

Ok guys, time to step it up. We need more people that are politically disengaged to learn about Yang. We have the power to do this. I'm going to start carrying Yang cards and put them under windshield wipers at every parking lot I got to. I think if more of us do this it can have a huge impact on getting the word out.

Andy watched "the impeachment." What a dope.
#####
The entire debate system they have is just who can insult the other persons ideals so much in the least amount of time that the candidate being insulted doesn‚Äôt have enough time to explain and defend themselves. The entire presidential election is just a show to distract the people and make them think that they‚Äôre vote actually does anything but help to put the next fat pig in his ivory tower in the White House. All the while the people are getting fucked in the ass by big companies and having all their money taken from them while getting fed pills to make them think that they‚Äôre life isn‚Äôt so terrible in order to not blow the governments cover for how long they‚Äôve been rigging the system against the people and for big companies and politicians

So stupid that he has to play the race card.  If you don't want racism then don't be racist.
#####
The DNC removed Andrew Yang from the debate because they said he had low poll numbers. And yet they let one other billionaire candidate in the debate who polls lower than Mr. Yang.¬† As i have been saying the DNC does not want Yang and now you are all seeing how they keep him out
#####
Really?  Only of color?  What about Pocahontas?  Harvard claimed she was first woman of color in their school.  Don't play that card Dang Yang.  You so smart.  You know better.  Ain't white a color?  Never thought we would hear a high IQ Asian talk about color. You so smart, why don't you have more people who like you?  You ain't gonna make it Dang Yang.  Start a business and get real rich.  Then try and be attractive.

No clue cnn ,we know your impeachment is a sham ,  and yang is a socialist, so if that's your cup of tea , I how ever prefer to earn and keep my own money.

Shut the FK up. Asian isn't colored. Keep virtue signalling numbskull.

"Candidate of color" lol
Trying to ride on the coat tails of african Americans.
There are more chinese with 500 million to spare than white people on planet earth combined.
Asians are the exact opposite of a "minority".
#####
Andrew Yang should be proud and work harder to win the debate. His skin color is  beautiful  he should embrace it with pride. His brain is the same color as all of the other candidates. He can use it wisely.
#####
I really like A. Yang
#####
MAJORITY white AMERICANS are not voting for a ASIAN,  BLACK PPL probably, but definitely not white ppl.
#####
(The CNN dude looks like he could be Gruesome Newsom's bro.)
#####
--Yeah; so what?¬†¬†

(Of course it‚Äôs now obvious Yang will be playing the race card ‚Äî which, as we all know, is a bit tricky being an Asian-American given, as a demographic, "those people" tend to place tops in income, academic achievement, and recent property acquisition.)
#####
Andrew yang making CNN great again.
#####
shout out to the yang gang
love you guys
you are a force to be reckon with
#####
Honestly Trump 2020
#####
God damn the media got so hung up on Andrew calling the impeachment a waste of time. Almost like they shifted all their eggs into the impeachment basket because it generates them so much clickbaity revenue and that if impeachment goes down the drain it‚Äôll seem like they were just trying to fill their pockets instead of doing their duty of informing the American people. But that isn‚Äôt true, right?
#####
Yanglinks.com if y'all need more information on Yang's policy positions.
#####
I don't know if I'm exactly correct on everything I'm saying but I researched a little and this is my opinion. 

His policies sound good but you have to be even more weary about anything sounding good. What I came to understand is that if Andrew Yang becomes the President of America, he will be the leader through the gateway to a social credit system. 

Andrew wants "Human Centered Capitalism". It's basically Socialism and Socialism doesn't work well with money. At first he says something I agree with. Humans are important than money, which is absolutely right. But then:

"The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar"
 "We need to make the markets serve us rather than the other way around"
"We need government leaders who are truly laser-focused on the public interest above all else and will lead companies to act accordingly"

The upside to his campaign kind of sounds like he wants to get more people more leverage when it comes to jobs. One of the concerns is paying everyone equally. To pay everyone equally, everyone will need to get less money. That really doesn't pan out too well with prices of our necessities increasing every year. Especially when regulators will also be more strict when it comes to a corporations excess profit.
¬† 
¬†¬† What is weird is how he refers to the corporations as if they are horses and regulators having to rein their excesses in. Then says "The government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value". Here I'm guessing the government is the owner of all the ranches. This is good for people who have the same values. However, I don't think that everyone really does. 

¬† "Regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position". That sounds like many corporations can face dramatic changes. Excess money can be used to reinvest into corporations immediately. But with this being a socialist method, the market needs to serve the people. As a result, this can just hurt the corporations. Regulators would need to be at the top of their game all the time. Additionally, they will be blocked out of an opportunity within the private sector. Their relationships with private sectors will become stagnant. 

¬† So now we have to ask how we affected by these regulators. With timebanking, they would be required to be more critical of how they regulate buisness and¬† determining the value of a Time Credit. They would have to make it fair while evaluating the skill set and social value of each person. People getting paid accordingly will be very rough. I assume Time credits won't fully replace curremcy. If this is to become popular people should keep this in mind: will there be FREE classes to ensure that we all have the skills to acquire time credits? On one hand, there won't be any because that takes time. People need to get paid to instruct, vast resources need to be acquired for the facilities usage and space will either need to be rented or constructed. Now let's say the government creates a loophole(cause they're the government), goes with this idea and pays out whatever amount of money to get this done. This has potential because job openings will increase through timebanking. However, there is still a drawback here. If they did that, I'm sure the government would tax us significantly to recoup losses and inevitably create a time credit monopoly. You have to account for a person's ingenuity, transportation, possible relocation for living quarters, etc. Even if people become like minded to make living easier, where would the money come from to support the people if timebanking becomes more prevalent or possibly our stable? 

¬† Andrew's campaign is meant to help out everyone do more than just get by. If people are expected to work multiple positions and are rewarded by meeting social expectations, they will be under pressure. Not only that, but what exactly will be acceptable in terms of social value? If you want to say that humans are more important than money, then you have to keep morale going. If morale is inconsistent, you will definitely have unhappy people. Which can cause inefficiency and lead to termination or people quitting their jobs. Here is where we see the downside of maximizing well being meeting the demand of it's controllers. 

¬† Andrew also believes in the advancement of technology and it's uses. With AI, we can have a system that allows us to see how reliable a person is before trading hours with them. Similar to how the Social Credit System is in China. But with technology advancing, it can easily put people out of jobs. With a "wearable device that monitors your vital signs"¬† that also starts "recommending occasional behavior changes", the world probably wouldn't even need as many doctor's. Which would be unfortunate for those who spent money and put in effort for a medical degree. But this may be untrue and I can possibly be proven wrong.

¬† Speaking of doctors, Andrew says he wants to reform the state of our health care system. He acknowledge's the amount of people who don't have healthcare, the difficulty paying off expenses, the job lock that people face to keep their health care plan and doctors not being able to properly help people. Now with more people being expected to trade hours doing work for credit, you will risk more people getting sick. This results in more doctors being needed; especially if we consider doctors needing to spend more time to give proper care and more people obtaining health a care plan. Better tests, technology and medicine means more resources and more money. So whether there be more or less doctors, they will continue to struggle with proper compensation. Thus, people will continue to struggle with healthcare and may face debt because of it.

¬† Lastly, let's talk about one of Andrew's strongest points: the Guaranteed Income.¬†Yang quotes many people who support this type of thinking. Initially, I did think it was a good idea and many others did as well. He wants to give every American $1,000/mo so they can add flexibility to their living situation. Things may be good for his first year or so but it'll be rough after that. The reason I say that is because it sounds like he somewhat believes in the Free Market Policy. To my understanding, the Free Market Policy allows financial freedom to obtain innovation within a country. However, a country has to cut corners in order to fulfill its objectives. This is the same policy Donald Trump follows during his presidency. With the pressure of more responsibility for the regulators, it will be impossible to advance using that policy without consequences. Enabling welfare throughout the country, starting the use of time banking and tax increases mean living will become more expensive. Resulting in people becoming dependent on welfare and struggling for time credit throughout his term as president. It will become likely that also America will face an economic crash due to it's large demand for resources and it's inability to pay off debt. Effectively making it a third world country.
¬† 
¬† That concludes my take on his policies. I may be wrong about some things but we'll have to see.
#####
He is Asian we don‚Äôt need a Asian president 
Us soldiers didn‚Äôt fight for America to vote in someone Asian 

Why is a Asian so interested in us politics and being president 

You people keep playing it cool knowing dam well he can‚Äôt be trusted Democratic Party can‚Äôt be trusted

Taiwan japan or China
 It donT matter 
They can‚Äôt be trusted as us president 
Period

In my eyes it‚Äôs a matter of national security 


We don‚Äôt have to prove nothing to no one if we don‚Äôt want an Asian president just accept it and move forward
America doesn‚Äôt have time for that shit we don‚Äôt have to appease someone just because they say to 

It‚Äôs not worth it
#####
Always about Race or Minorities, right Liberal MSM? The poor oppressed. Sheesh. This horse died so long ago.

I actually want him to run as an independent. Even if it splits the dems it will at least show the country the choice does not always have to come down to the lesser of two evils.

Meng for Yang 20/20!!!

There goes the dems part by by
#####
Lol a rapper hahahahha so a singer wow has the yang's back wow one step back
#####
China is not a threat that doesnt exist it's just a talking point
#####
Disagree with Yang on this one. There are asians who struggle in this country.  Specifically south east Asians tend to struggle more than east Asians economically. Many Cambodian, Hmong and Lao Americans struggle with poverty today. Many of these Asian groups were also refuged in impoverished violent neighborhoods when coming to the US in the 80s.
#####
CNN sure hates white people.
#####
I really like this guy! He really relates to the middle class.. And that 1 a month could go towards retirement and that's what alot of people are lacking nowadays
#####
Person of color? Yeah Asian Americans are the wealthiest and most educate people in America today. Shut the hell up with this trash.
#####
Now he's a racist. Go back to Taiwan. How many white politicians are there in taiwain? You're a fool.
#####
re;  Yang Election Gimmick - Don't be deluded fools drunk on false promises by someone talking bullshite,  trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.. $1,000 a month money will get spent in the consumer market and cause inflation, because producers will raise their prices due to increased demand, before they even bother expanding production to meet that demand, by raising capital to invest in new productive capacity. Thus higher prices for the same economic basket lead to devaluation of the dollar.  Economics 101.  It's is an election gimmick, little more. If you'eve ever run a business you would realise that raising prices is the easiest way to generate more revenue and profit,  in the face of increasing demand, without incurring additional manufacturing overheads. Thus you are essentially increasing your profit margins simply by increasing prices and those higher prices will be sustainable due to the  higher consumer demand. It ultimately means this election gimmick is all for nothing, other than cheap votes. Too easy. This dude is shifty as hell and can't be trusted by voters. Massive crooked con job.  The sad part is,  that there are many people dumb enough to fall for it.
#####
Play that race card Yang ,it won‚Äôt help you socialist, communist politicians ,people got you figured out.

I am Asian and I give zero f**ks about the race. Policy is more important that race, as it should be.

I love when these Democrat candidates say there‚Äôs no diversity left on the stage. They‚Äôre basically calling democratic voters racist

Omg üòÇ they were foaming at the mouth with questions about impeachment after he laid out all of the real life struggles of Americans. I have to laugh to cope, but this was honestly sad to see. At least Van tried to get back to a real topic
#####
You will never see a Democrat more angry than when a person of color sides with a Republican. Just google Terrence Williams or Candace Owens and observe how their fellow brothers and sisters (the woke dignified intellectuals) treat them if you disagree. Why such impulsive and predictable hate coming from people who so often claim to be the party of tolerance, inclusion and love? It seems so strange and hypocritical for these individuals -- who have decided to think for themselves and to separate themselves from their racial identities -- to be attacked so viscously and mercilessly each time, like clockwork. How does the left justify and tolerate this hatred and violence coming out of their own party? 


Whatever the justification, the reason is clear: it is a manifestation of a deep-seeding realization that this person can no longer be controlled by their skin color. By leaving the Democratic party, they are escaping the prism of identity politics and this means a complete loss of control for the democrats -- a party that hinges their entire agenda on identity politics. If you stop thinking about yourself as an African-American, or Muslim-American or Hispanic-American, and start thinking about yourself as an American, then the left cannot control you through fear anymore. They want you to fear the republicans because all their power hinges on the premise that Republics are racists, and once you stop believing that, they lose all their power. 


It concerns them that the escapee no longer thinks about themselves as a black or brown or yellow person, but as an individual with their own ideas that cannot be defined by where they came from or how they look. They have proven that they are capable of thinking about policy, principles and ideas larger than themselves and outside of the framework of race. Since they themselves no longer feel the need to fit in and become a clone to their racial counterparts, they cannot be controlled as a singular unit by a centralized power. In essence, they are no longer a sheep to be herded around blindly. And this scares the hell out of democrats, to the point of rage, because when people lose power they become angry. Hence why Democrats become so vicious when someone simply wants to believe in things like tax cuts and limited government that have nothing to do with race, but yet the Democrats will make it about race and threaten you with fear.  If every black person thinks differently and independently, how will the Democrats control the entire bunch? 


The number one agenda of the Democratic party is portray all white males, especially those in the Republican party as inherent racist. And if you're not racists then you're still guilty of having come from a predominately and historically racist lineage which demands that you now defer automatically to anyone who is of a darker hue. We see it embedded in nearly every news story that airs, even if only subtly alluded to. Race underpins the discussions surrounding everything: sports, immigration, law enforcement, foreign policy, education, Hollywood and even climate change. It is the white man who started the companies that abuse the minorities and cause the climate change, right? 
If democrats and liberal media can successfully portray all republicans as racists and separate us entirely across racial lines, in every aspect of American life, then they can easily control us with one message, through the mechanisms of fear and hate. 


Here is how they do it: they report on a story and make it always about race. They then say they are unbiased and are doing it merely to shed a light on evil and thus are immune to any type of criticism, because we all know you can't shoot the messenger. After they have successfully disseminated these deliberately divisive stories, they then say their agenda is to bring us BACK together after they have successfully and secretly separated us across racial lines. Rinse and repeat. Their goal is to keep us in an ever-constant state of unrest, leaving us to hang in the balance, while they pull their strings like puppeteers, laughing all the way to the bank.  


By making race the number one focus, it absolves them of any real responsibility to their constituencies. They don't have to do actually get anything done because the only thing people can focus on is how we are all different from one another on the basis of color and all we can talk about is how that makes us feel. They will not be held accountable for actually improving American lives if they can evoke enough hatred and fear from their own party and distract them from what's actually really important: which is policy.  Endless allegations of racial prejudice is the panacea for democrats, because no matter how bad they themselves behave, well, at least they're not racist, right?

I am a supporter of Trump. But if Yang vs Trump. Yang got my vote.

PLEASE DONATE @ yang2020.com, as of now we've raised $936,032 out of $3 million needed by Dec. 31, 2019 at 11:59 PM. Anything helps. Upvote this so it can be seen. Thanks! #yanggang
#####
I feel the minorities that Andrew came across just didn't feel as strong as a candidate as Yang. So they bowed out to give the minorities a clear indication on who they want to run as the democratic candidate.
#####
Yang is literally the only candidate that reengage the Obama coalition and I don‚Äôt think Democrats realize that. Go look back to the 2008 Campaign and tell me I‚Äôm wrong.
#####
Exactly what Yang was saying. He's focusing on real American issues and these reporters keep reverting back to "impeachment, impeachment!"
No one cares! That's the problem with OUR media. 
We care about solving the issues that really matter to us
#####
Will Yang take on the greed that is ruining this country? It‚Äôs one thing to give everyone $1000 - taking on the fossil fuel industry, big pharma, agribiz... that‚Äôs a different story. I like Yang. I just wonder if he‚Äôs going to actually steer this ship (which clearly he‚Äôs attempting to do via the freedom dividend).
#####
I hate when Asians call themselves people of color
#####
I'm pretty sure Jews are a minority ...
#####
He's soooooooo sad,while using the race card!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a liberal,always keep the race card in your back pocket.Never know when it might come in handy!Liberals are all the same.
#####
And the only one who makes rational sense
#####
Good to see yang n Donald on the same line
Help Americans 
Amazon clos down 30 #  business store most of  their products outside us some from China what. Is that say
#####
You can always tell when a Democrat speaks.
They blame others they speak of race and usually start by insulting someone...
I'm Jay and I APPROVE OF THIS MESSAGE.. HOW ABOUT YOU?
#####
To witness Yang‚Äôs growth in just the last six months alone is incredible. #YangGang ü§ôüèº
#####
Yang is the hero we need in this divided country. Seriously. Do the right thing america. Mend the divide.
#####
What color is he?
#####
If Yangs skin is white, he'll win..
#####
Remember yang is a offspring of Taiwanes parents. If he where to the be elected. The ccp will be spoked by him because he's a descendant of a Taiwanese family. We vote for yang and hopefully China will leave Hong Kong alone.
#####
YANG IS THE KING

its not disappointing to observe democrats try to explain their cultural insecurities and mentally defective demands to feel as if they can represent their own sense of fairness as it applies to the partys image, its pathetic. but in that pathetic reality of desperate democrat demands to be perceived according to what they want to not do speak for, yang is the second best example. behind black mayor pete. sorry to say chief warren and her tribe are less diverse for marketing purposes than joe and his white kids, but joe can play drums too.
#####
If Andrew yang is president Trump's wall is still gonna be built so what's the point of trump being president?
#####
6:03 when he said"they ain't got no money" I felt that
#####
I switched from Republican Party to vote for Yang!  And I know for sure there‚Äôs a lot more than just me doing exactly the same thing!  Would love to see the numbers IRT üòÅ
#####
You can‚Äôt tell me our politics isn‚Äôt rigged everyone INCLUDING REPUBLICANS love him when I tell them to look him up YANG 2020
#####
lmao my guy hit da diamond filter on em
#####
REPUBLICAN FOR ANDREW YANG PLEASE DEMOCRATS GIVE US THIS MAN YOUR PARTY WILL BE BACK IN THE WHITEHOUSE
#####
Women are a minority group?
#####
A lot of the media is trying to put him in the dark, we cannot allow that.
#####
Is American ready to have an Asian President? What are your views? And: If US has a gay president, "the first lady" would be called "the first husband"? Is America ready for a gay President? What an interesting country!
#####
A certain skin colour experience is bullshit because people are individuals
#####
I'm all in on the yang ganf
#####
This is one of the few political CNN videos without a crippling amount of dislikes.
#####
I don‚Äôt like democrats but the way he‚Äôs getting censored while having good ideas is crazy to me
#####
"although you really could add women in that" lol he thinks women are a minority. Really sad to see Yang playing the race card.
#####
He has low chances of winning, Bernie and Biden are the top ones, didn‚Äôt even know bts was gone run for president.
#####
These guys forget Trump's space force.
#####
Andrew yang beat Russia‚Äôs guy? He ran against one of the Clinton‚Äôs or is this a reference to beating Biden?
#####
YANG2020
#####
Love you Yang! Love the super strong and sharp sincere and sagacious sight you have. Thank you.
#####
It is criminal the lack of time they give such an amazing candidate, who is really trying to solve all of our problems...if the DNC wants to win they need to get their shit together and put more attention on Yang
#####
I am so glad such a genuine person is running for the Presidential Elections... 
Andrew Yang is being supported by the US masses and that‚Äôs like the best case scenario right now...
He wants to work for the nation and not just win the Office.
Andrew Yang 2020
(Even Bernie Sanders is a great candidate)
#####
Yang was ignored in the debates tonight. He has my vote
#####
To the part of me that doesn't vote : "I think we got a winner."
#####
How can hearing Yang's words here, not make you get a lump in your throat??  THIS is the leadership and HEART that our lost little nation needs, oh so desperately!


President Yang, please save the USA!


Humbly,


Your Fellow Americans
#####
He deflected from the first question to go onto his memorized talking points. The question was asking him about his lack of experience in government and military and how he‚Äôd deal with a terrorist attack or natural disaster. Come on Yang :(
#####
DANG YANG HES ON POINT
#####
Yang for president !!!! Respect !
#####
He is a cross between Seth Macfarlane and Bruce Lee.  He has my vote.
#####
I‚Äôm voting for Andrew Yang alright
#####
yang you are amazingüòé
#####
Vote for Yang! $12,000 a year will makes a huge difference for struggling single moms, struggling college students and families that need extra financial support while growing their new business. Our country needs Andrew Yang. All people, black, white, yellow and red will vote for Andrew Yang. Our country economy will boom!
#####
I will never understand why some democrats call conservatives fascist, but then turn around and promote policies that give government more control. Policies like universal health care and forcing people off their private care, even higher taxes, forcing people to pay for other‚Äôs college, online censorship, and censoring speech in general is not right. It‚Äôs not American. Not to mention dismantling our right to bear arms and not having borders. I guess we can all take the front doors off our house too... I just can‚Äôt get behind these things. And this talk about a new world order and doing something because other countries did is scary. It‚Äôs easy to vote your rights away, but it‚Äôs difficult to get them back. Stop being so dependent on the government. Wake up!
#####
Andrew Yang is new forward president, suitable for USA year 2020 to 2028.
#####
omg i just saw this! He got my vote! wow those answers though. pretty straight forward
#####
This guy is 10 years ahead
#####
Yang seems like a great candidate, although his chances for 2020 are very low. I‚Äôd gladly support him in 2024.
#####
So if this guy doesn't win we have only ourselves to blame.
#####
If only America would wake up to a real person who has so much to offer.
#####
A CHINESE GUY WHO DOES NOT TRUST CHINESE PEOPLE -  NOW USA WILL BE A BREEDING GROUND OF ALL CHINESE DISEASES IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT
#####
First time voter for Yang and only Yang
#####
Holy moly. This guy is really making sense. And he is believable.
#####
Andrew yang wants to give money and let people stay home - that‚Äôs how China attacks foreign governments. Fact.
#####
Damn that closing remark is strong af!
#####
if all the other Dems were true patriots, they'd all bow out and let Andrew be the nominee. Like in Lucas, walk in and lay down your jersey! They must all know secretly that Yang has all the best ideas!
#####
amazing 6:09
#####
Wow.
#####
It is a bit strange to me listen to a discussion that in my country was going on in my grandfathers youth. In my country all healthcare schools and more is funded by the government through tax money. They who earn most pay the highest percentage, middle incomers not so much, retired and real low incomers very little sometimes nothing. However, no one is  against a private solution so that exist also simoustanielssly. You choos. Not many use the private options, why should they, they can get it for free and the quality is good ?
I am just a little bit scared hearing how ignorant Americans sounds on things like this.
To not let anyone left under the bridge save communities from a lot of crime done in desperation. It will not help you to salute the American flagg because it is after all a piece of fabric, unless you like a tribe in the Amazon jungle start acting on taking care of each other and other Americans for real. That means like the marines and the tribes to not let anyone behind. Scandinavians do this but I really do not think they think of it as politics or a certain system, they have just always look out for each other.
#####
America's too dumb to elect a smart Asian man
#####
Andrew Yang has donations from billionaires Bernie Sanders does not you can never catch Bernie Sanders in a lie he's not a corporate politician like Yang and his Tech Buddies

Yang 2020!

It appears DNC and the Mainstream Media once again are blind to the pulse of people. They happen to have not only the ideal candidate but the most necessary one with Andrew Yang in their grasp and cannot come to grips to realize it. Instead of providing and illuminating him they are actively working to suppress and marginalize him. I have no reason to watch any further so-called Debates. I already know what the cherry picked candidates stand for.

These so-called debates are useless and function as a suedo infomercial. If it were to have any value it would be as a means provide exposure to those less know canidates. Hey even you plagerism Pete, I still would like to see you on the debate stage. I really would like to see what are your real motives and thought process why you are the one to guide and provide the leadership needed to improve the lives of us citizens. Sure you may have enchanted the mainstream Media with your smooth responses to their softball questions, but it takes a lot more than that to prove you possess the tools of a problem solver. In my opinion Pete, it is obvious that your motives to run for President is purely ego driven. Sure you speak like an an educated man and are quick to respond in a coherent logical manner. Which unfortunately used to be assumed that anyone holding the office of President of the USA would already possess.

And Yes It is Obvious that Chump must be removed, but the problems will not magically disappear when he is gone. I still do not know what is your platform? The only thing of substance has been extraced from Andrew Yang's talking points, which you have repacked as your own. I'm expecting you to roll out a version of UBI which you will promise to give all citizens $1001 a month. It not cool to copy off the smart Asian kids paper and pass it as your own. The rest of the established politicians I do not need to see you again. Your actions as politicians is in the public record and I can look at that record to tell me what you stand for. Any new words that are inconsistent with that record will speak louder than what is proclaimed or promised.

So In these times of intellectual blindness and emotional irrationality it becomes important that Reason should not be abandoned. And Reason has revealed the one canidate that holds a sincere motive for seeking the office of President of the USA. I Sincerely believe Andrew Yang motives are driven by his concern for his children's future and the lack of understanding what is the impending reality that is in motion. He knows that the consequence of inaction will devistate society as we know it. He not only is aware of it but has mapped out a plan to transition to a practical solution. Most of all he does not feel it something a single individual can solve, But a single individual can influence the collective to achieve the needed results. Yang is a reasonable problem solver.

He has been forthright and had not been one to promise, pander or mislead one without taking a factual and logical approach. An approach which a solution can increase the odds of a favorable outcome to occur. Unlike most politicians he is interested in solutions that can produce results. Most politicians motives revolve around their Ego and Lust for power, they will do and say what the voters want to hear to solicit their vote. After all that is said and done the Status Quo will remain. Now Let use some reason to champion UBI (Freedom Dividend). UBI is a practical solution to a factual problem.

Can we all agree that the Trickle Down Economy Myth needs to be completely Destroyed and never seen again. It's obvious that it is not wise and relies on the assumption that GREEDY CAPITALISTS will reinvest in human labor.

The facts are: Corporations, Businessman and the WEALTHY ARE NOT JOB CREATORS!!! CUSTOMERS ARE!! No Business or Corporation can exist without CUSTOMERS or Clients. You may have the Greatest Products or Services and it still will not make a difference without CUSTOMERS. If people CANNOT AFFORD your goods or services? You are Guaranteed to go OUT OF BUSINESS! Henry Ford understood this over a hundred years ago. If he paid his employees a high enough wage then in turn they will have means to purchase one of the cars they are producing. This ensured the survival of his business. Ford saw this as an investment which he would recover a large portion of that wage back to him.

Okay Everyone it's time took look at UBI for what it really represents: LEVERAGE! Everything revolves around the concept of LEVERAGE. Leverage is the SUPER POWER that enables and multiplies ones ability to carry MORE with LESS. The UBI (Freedom Dividend) really represents LEVERAGE. The $1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage their situation. Once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum. As we know leverage is the key ingredient that reduces the energy needed to overcome resistance. This effect MINIMIZES the probability of placing the burden on others. Some people like Chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery, essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage. Their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain. As everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times. This leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level. So the LARGER the GAP the more extreme the leverage becomes. The GREATEST Leverage is held by those of Hoarded Generational wealth.

Those whom are the descendants and beneficiaries of inherited wealth are The Primary group which has Stigmatized Welfare and UBI for generations. They purposely Stigmatize and cast shame on those in poverty. And what is truly disgusting is they draw pleasure from cruelly denying any form of assistance and actively work to humiliate one in order to strip them of their Human Dignity. This is due to the psychological sub-conscious projection of their own GUILT for receiving funds by BIRTHRIGHT instead of through MERIT!

Other than those Entitled Pricks there is no good reason to oppose UBI if you are a Company or Businessman. They are the ones who stand to benefit the most from UBI Because it increases the means for patrons to purchase what they are peddling. It is a true investment in the Economy rather than giving Wealthy Pricks TAX BREAKS and SUBSIDIES which ultimately causes damage to the economy by extracting the currency from circulating. It becomes hoarded and extracted, placed in an account offshore in a tax shelter. This extracted currency cannot generate anything but more Leverage sitting in a bank account. It is taken out circulation and cannot generate taxes and sales needed for a strong economy. It is Beyond Short SIGHTED to oppose UBI and favor those whom already posess Extreme levels of Leverage.

A greater WEALTH GAP will only cause DESPERATION and ANXIETY which will build even greater Economic Instability setting the conditions for Criminal behavior. A ticking time bomb which will have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of Civil Unrest. GREED AND SELFISHNESS will Blind them from the Obvious. It is Obvious to spread the wealth to generate commerce rather than to concentrate it. Otherwise, if concentrated you would be choking and Killing the Golden Goose preventing it from continuing to lay it's golden eggs. It would be much wiser to feed and look out for the Gooses best interest, you will be rewarded with a flow of Golden Eggs

Can anyone deny that $1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling. To teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind. In Fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching. And for the growing homeless population across this country, what could $1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job. Raising the Minimum Wage will not even come close to the impact of a $1000 a month will do. If fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee. This helps both Business owner and consumer by providing more money in hand to support that business with patronage.

The biggest criticism to UBI is the cost. Again this is SHORT SIGHTED blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board. Starting with the release of pressure and Anxiety that SCARCITY brings. It allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of ABUNDANCE instead of scarcity. With a SCARCITY Mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials. Not to mention the burden that Stress related illnesses caused by a Scarcity mindset places on the healthcare industry driving up higher healthcare costs. A Scarcity mindset effects businesses with LESS Patronage and taxes generated to pay for programs such as UBI. It also will lessen the burden on law enforcement and incarceration. When one is incarcerated it cost real money to feed and house them, this will only become a lesser burden on the tax payer to sustain the institution. This is an inevitable fact when Economic DESPAIR becomes magnified it starts a domino effect that crimes becomes a reality.
Desperation creates the mindset of: "if I have nothing than I have nothing to lose". The cost and burden to society would be multiple times that of the alternative of ensuring a living wage.

Ponder this:
Suppose you had $1-billion. You could spend $5,000 a day for more than 500 years before you would run out of money.
Breaking it down even farther, it means you would have to spend over $100,000 every day for the next 25 years in order to spend $1-billion.
#####
Some throw away lines but seems honest and rehearsed.
#####
Is this the 5th debate.?
#####
Im curious now. Democrats have someone with potential. I hope it will be Yang vs Trump. I really dont have a issue about Trump either so better man win.
#####
Ive begun to actively research Andrew Yang and I like I see ive had that mindset since bush 2nd term
that is the behind in technology that I feel
#####
He is so right about tech giants like amazon and google not paying their fair share of taxes. But they cause so many problems in our society. Namely, they kill moms and pops, retails. They make their employees so rich and jack up housing prices. That drive others to be homeless. Why the heck are these companies not paying fair share when the rest of us hard working middle income Americans pay 30-40% of our paychecks ???
#####
I‚Äôm republican, but if any democrat wins, I want it to be this guy.
#####
Yang is the only chance for the democrats because no one else can debate trump. But if yang gets the nomination, I think trump is at the disadvantage.
#####
HE GOT MY VOTE  !  HE'S SMART AND EDUCATED !
#####
hes my president coz hes not 70-90 years old. the youth need to take the torch to fix the problems of the youth.
#####
I'm looking for his flaws, but all I see is a man trying to make a better place for his family and this country. I don't see someone trying to play a politician I see a person who's looking to fix our economy, advance tech, and make sure kids and parents have a path to success.
#####
Wow he has got my vote!
#####
Let Yang lead us through the 4th Industrial Revolution & bring USA back to the #1 world power of technology and economics.
#####
Illegal immigrants are foreign entities meddling in are elections
#####
If he got time same as biden he would have crushed it man üëçüòé
#####
He‚Äôs very smart and I agree what he is saying but just saying he still didn‚Äôt answer the question. (What if......)
#####
Yang mind of a child
#####
That closing statement really resonated with me. Its tough and I really don‚Äôt know what the future holds but to be told that theres people working to improve our futures and that we‚Äôll be alright is comforting.
#####
Last night i cried after watching this... he's the hero we deserve
#####
Thank you. NBC NY
#####
Andrew Yang,understood the system of USA what need to be done! Israel wish you well! Andrew!  What we want from you is to support Israel capital city Jerusalem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Mr. Yang is a problem solver! He needs to be  VP if Biden wins the Dem nom & the Presidency.
#####
I really like the 1k or 2k a month idea to raise kids.  Thats better than free higher education by far.  The only question I have is where would it come from?  What is ashame is that we are not doing it ourselves but I also realize as a homeschool father of 4 that not all families are as lucky as mine to have a working spouse with a good job.  We also get 1k a kid back in taxes... it would be nice to see that as 4-5 k each kid but having to be invested into the kids future "IE small part going towards college savings etc" and not the local liquor store.
#####
As a canadian, Donald Trump has completely fucked up diplomacy with so many countries. We are close to another cold war with Russia/China/North Korea. He needs restore diplomacy with the allies. The fact that hes even proposing data and privacy laws is amazing. I BET you ANYTHING big companies like google, Amazon, facebook and every other website taking our data is going to donate against him. Americans and everyone who wants to help needs to donate to him so he can fight the corrupt companies who are inevitably funding his opponents.
#####
he the candidate of the future really . I hope hes more successful next time. Technology is the answer to our problems .
#####
It really would break my heart if he doesn't become our president one day.
#####
But I really hope Donald trump will get re-elected though, and Andrew/tulsi can  be a president  in 2024
#####
Andrew Yang is very smart
#####
This guy will destroy trump if he goes goes 1vs1 with him .
#####
Mr. Yang is awesome
#####
Andrew Yang is correct about having parents/a parent staying home with children instead sending them off to the workforce. I was fortunate to have my mother stay at home so I always had someone to depend on when I came home from school. I felt safer, I was cared for, and emotionally and mentally, I think it helped me develop as a person. Please, we need a President who understands the root of our issues starting with how American families are developing individually and as a group. üá∫üá∏‚ù§
#####
How long are these debates? Seven minutes don't seem like much.
#####
Don‚Äôt know about you guys but I‚Äôd probably vote for Yang if he somehow became the Democrat Nominee.
#####
Not left or right but forward
#####
ang yes please solve the problem trump made high employment strong borders strong defense first
#####
I‚Äôm turning 18 in a few months and when I do, I‚Äôm voting yang without a doubt. If anyone is gonna make America GREAT again, it‚Äôs him.
#####
Why is Amy getting more time to speak again?
#####
Yang people.are in the dark in our houses we have been living here 40 yrs breathing the same air my grandmother was born here in 1913 they told us it was a white cacausian war
#####
Seeing and listening to this guy makes me want to move to America, get a citizenship and vote him
#####
Yang 2020, because you know how to spend your money better than the government does.
#####
World data organization. I like that.
#####
He touches on a lot of issues and stays focused on them. I think he's great. That being said I don't think he actually answered the first question. Lol
#####
He is smarter than Obama
#####
LATINOS FOR YANG IN 2020!!!!
#####
Wow...
 Ladies and gentlemen...
  Mr. Andrew Yang!
 Biden and Bernie need...NEED to just joust eachother for VP and put their combined efforts behind this guy. 
 Yang speaks with urgency and desire both of which resonate with many, many people, myself included.
 This guy is (so farüòö) a class act.
#####
Thank you MSNBC for this video!!
#####
MSNBC still acting like he don't exist tho...

That closing statement would make for the best presidential address of my generation.

Hey CNN, notice how every single democratic debate video has crap ton of dislikes? Notice how every yang video has a crap ton of likes?


That's the poll. No poll experts needed. Pretty obvious, huh
#####
I agree with most of the stuff he says, but hes just not as good as bernie
#####
lmao this video has more likes and views than all "qualifying polls" for the debate tomorrow.  POLL THE INTERNET I DOUBLE DOG DARE YOU
#####
Lmao i see a lotta ppl with 90s anime pfps what weebs

Hillary is getting the nomination in the end anyway so this is all a complete waste of time
#####
Jimmy kimmel, you‚Äôre trash
#####
trump has been mispronouncing China for so long what does Andrew expect ? sympathy ? $1,000 a month is chump change. Fox News suggests $125,000 per person per year to realize the American dream. Elon is not American ??? WTF
#####
Its too early to give free money to people. First machines and robots have to make at least the half of the entire US wealth, only then the system could retire people early. Giving away money before the robots manage to produce enough national wealth would be economic suicide
#####
Jimmy Kimmel is such a tool.

I just lost respect for jimmy

Andrew Yang is smart than low-class Kimmel.
#####
Why do these Pink people sometimes reveal their true colours?
#####
The thing is that Jimmy is good in making jokes about the ‚Äúlosers‚Äù in the American society. For example; it‚Äôs good for the rates to make fun of Donald trump because everybody has an opinion on him. But with Yang it‚Äôs totally different.. nobody hates or likes this guy.. he is new and fighting the way up and nobody knows him. Now people like jimmy, can‚Äôt handle these types of guys... that‚Äôs why he is mocking him on his show. It‚Äôs sad..
#####
jimmy is sucks! fake smiles

Mark Zuckerberg is in support of UBI.  He won't be killing Yang. Google "Zuckerberg UBI speech at Harvard."

Andrew Yang is an idiot

How dare you Jimmy.

That was rude and tactless Jimmy. üóëÔ∏è

That's no way to treat and host a presidential candidate.  Never liked Jimmy Kimmel, now I dislike him even more.
#####
Screw Jimmy
#####
I'm Asian n like Yang but I don't think jimmy s jokes r so offensive.
Are they?
#####
Jimmy clearly has an agenda of his own what the hell is he doing?
#####
I somehow like the ignorant and biased interviews the best. It showcases how composed and well tempered Andrew is.
#####
Wtf Jimmy?! Why are you being so condescending towards Yang and his run for POTUS dude? Smh
#####
Kimmel is outrageously stupid! What an unclassy way of interviewing mr Yang
#####
This is why no one can touch Conan O'Brien.

What the hell I wrong with this Kimmel guy!
Is he being played by his superiors like a puppet!

Normal scorpio behavior, hilary is a scorpio also

Relevance, intelligence, innovativeness, humaneness is what all of American needs right now to do exactly what Yang is describing - it's coming, how can we ALL participate, benefit, and further innovation for the greater good.¬† No old white guy can know of that nor lead America through that process - and I'm talking Senate as well as Presidency.

Yang 2020!

Jimmy Kimmel is an idiot who drank the corrupt DNC's  koolaid. Hollywood sheep like Kimmel are the biggest enablers of systemic racism and discrimination.
#####
Jimmy Fallon please fire this idiot he ruins your name ü§¢
#####
I used to really like you Jimmy. Now I just find you incredibly intolerable. Just blatantly rude, nothing you said was funny. Can this man be replaced by any of the up and coming comedians who have more class? We don‚Äôt need trash comedians and late night talk show hosts like this that propagate rude behaviour.
#####
No comments!
#####
This comment section is gold, Jimmy Kimmel is a tool
#####
Jimmy honestly is soo boring! Only time I watch it is because Guillermo is doing something hilarious. Wouldn't of clicked this if it wasn't for yang.
#####
Fawk jimmy k√ºmmel he doesn‚Äôt know anything!!
#####
My like is for Andrew Yang, not for Jimmy Kimmel
#####
0:56 oh yeah, That‚Äôs so funny haha
#####
F*** you, Jimmy Kimmel. 

After how MSMBS and DNC have smeared Andrew Yang I've lost faith in them so, I'll vote for Trump.
#####
Jimmy Kimmel literally tried to divert the conversation toward stupid subjects... just wow.
#####
Just unsubscribed.
#####
To this day ted Cruz is still ducking. What a pussy.
#####
Jimmy says Americans play video games, when in reality they work three jobs( part time) because Corps don‚Äôt like full time). Americans have high mortgages and high student loans to pay. And new unskilled immigrants put out of jobs low skilled Americans( this is a real issue ignored). Other phenomena that‚Äôs happened American workers are replaced with new visa workers that get paid less. Instead that corporations to compete for best workers or to train them, they go out globally and flood America with low paid foreigners, to avoid paying Americans with living wages and benefits. What Americans have to do now, to foreclose their homes and to file for bankruptcy? And I don‚Äôt know why Jimmy thinks he is great, and relevant for his opinion ?
#####
Andrew Yang I‚Äôm for you as President of U.S.A. ‚≠êÔ∏èüåü‚≠êÔ∏è
#####
I'm looking forward to Yang winning and Kimmel eating the humble pie
#####
Wow. What a jackass kimmel. ü§Æ

Jimmy Kimmel is so boring that AI robot will replace him soon.
#####
wtf is wrong with Jimmy Kimmel
#####
Andrew Yang is the best!

Jimmy you're obviously bitter about something. You've been a real schmuck with a well developed passive aggressive mean streak. Figure it out and get over it. We want the real Jimmy back!! Please!!!

Jimmy... you failed so bad

Please notice that robots machine automation just only use in enterprises and factory and company and hospital and government agency & military armed force.  Ubi just only for American enterprises's workers, that's correct logic analysis. Ubi is not universal basic income, it's unconditional basic income. What kind of circumstances are unconditional basic income? For enterprises's workers future will be replaced by artificial intelligence robots automation

I hope Yang wins; Jimmy was rude!

This is why Kimmel is such a tool! 
His show is all trump hate but when a reasonable candidate comes to your show, he shows disrespect
#####
He's good
#####
Amozon already have and are using robot trucks. Kimmel sucks...
#####
I dont think jimmy likes Yang
#####
I am from the future. Kimmel says he regrets being disrespectful to president-elect in the past.

PLEASE GO OUT AND VOTE!!! YOUR VOTE DOES MATTER! EXPRESS YOUR RIGHT!!

If everyone has an "extra $1000/mo" then nobody does. Make sense?

#####
The hell did you just say Kimmel? I'd take Yang any day over crusty Ol' Sanders.
#####
This is so Disrespectful to Andrew Yang, Jimmy.
#####
Yang deserves more respect and more media attention, he'd make a better president than any of the other dems.  At least he's got thought out plans.
#####
Jimmy needs to redeem himself by getting ANDREW YANG back on!
#####
Go Union
#####
Elon may not be US citizen but he has built businesses in US and created jobs in US. Apple is an American company but a lot of it's profits are stashed in Ireland to avoid paying American taxes. Apple and any company that puts profits over America (Amazon with $0 in 2018 taxes) should be labeled as traitors to this country.
#####
That money would be so good for gaming!! Imagine all the game sales@
#####
Jimmy kimmel and some other cheap comedian hosts should learn some basic human traits like how to show some respect. These hosts are so classless.
#####
Damn, there are a hell of a lot of sensitive Yang supporters here. Seriously, who cares if Jimmy says or believes that Yang can or can‚Äôt do something. Shake that chit off and get back to supporting your guy, you bunch of crybaby azz  ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è
#####
F*ck Jimmy Kimmel.
#####
I used to rate kimmel higher than most other current hosts (except of course conan), because hes a genuine comedian and at times shows pretty quick wit. But lately hes shown an arrogant, close minded side where he treats his guests with a lack of respect. You saw it in the joaquin phoenix interview as well. He comes as across as a meaner jimmy fallon - and I DONT like jimmy fallon. For all colberts and meyers flaws, yang is much more of a guest suited to them, and they handled it much much better.
#####
Two people who are really losing at their jobs ü•±
#####
Jimmy can make me crack up in some interviews but this one you could tell he was trying to cheapen what yang what's to accomplish for everyone as they were petty trash plans
#####
Well, the young people better get out and vote...because as long as the boomer generation can continue to vote, they will have us outnumbered.
#####
Andrew has as much chance of becoming potus as Jimmy has of being a decent talk show host.
#####
Your vote is useless, the government wipes their ass with your vote, if you want change we need a revolution
#####
Yang the mind of a child
#####
White man put down asian man's idea whats new
#####
He has some interesting ideas, but he's just not Presidential Material. Plus he has been wishy-washy on his medicare plan as of late. He needs to explain that better to the public.
#####
Kibble n Bits the talk show host.. Major lifetime achievement, he's almost a game show host now. Great success! Just another Godless buffoon taking up space.
#####
As a truck driver I ll vote for you.
#####
NOMINATE YANG AMERICA!  GO SMART SOLUTIONS!  DO THE MATH!  GO YANG!  VOTE DEM VOTE DEM  I will do my duty and VOTE against the stupidist potus ever

Kimmel can be an a-hole sometimes.

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
I'm for the spirit of Andrew yang. Sorry yang gang (lol) Andrew is not it..
#####
Disappointing
#####
So misleading he did even officially endorse yang
#####
Andrew  Yang has gotten tremendous youth support harnessing the power of internet to generate his online presence, and any pop culture artiste that thrives on the gen youth fan base ,understands also the power of the internet, and youth  pop culture stars  who supports Andrew will stand to gain millions of  immense dedicated fans , who can be as  fanatical and dedicated to them ,as they are to Andrew as Yang Gangers .
 Internet sensation Andrew is clearly making history in having his support of the Internet and that makes him a pioneer of becoming the 1st US President boosted into office via mobilizing the power of the Internet and not conventional mass media.
And that is the ultimate  irony because Andrew also has declared himself  to be a tech and digital age persona and that his campaign also revolves around navigating challenges of 21st century digital  infomation age  and AI

He s the only one talking about jobs lost due to automation which potentially obliterate the whole working class of America. Have you seen the empty malls near where you live? It s happening every where else too.

It would be super cool if yang could win but he‚Äôs just not big enough and Americans won‚Äôt vote an Asian into office sadly. Trumps gonna win again.

#####
Yang Ganggggg
#####
We need Andrew Yang for our autonomous future.
#####
No one should be surprised that most wealthy celebrities aren't supporting the guy who will raise their taxes (Sanders). Yang's biggest idea (UBI) is funded by a VAT tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. Not to mention that he fails to adequately address the underlying issues that are causing the wealth and income divide that has ravaged the American working class. HINT: it's not just AI and automation. There are MANY structural problems in our economic and social systems that Yang simply fails to even discuss, either because he doesn't understand them or he realized that his plan doesn't address them. No one understands the depth and severity of the problems we face better than Sanders and he has solid solutions as well. Of course, you can disagree, but my mind is made up. I'm all in for Sanders, as is everyone I know.
#####
Watch some of Yang's talks and interviews (pick something at least 40 minutes long) and you will end up endorsing Yang too!
#####
This is YUUUUUUUUGGGGGE

Sorry, so who dis Donald Glover? A basketball player, a mayor, comedian?

Y‚Äôall seeing the like to dislike ratio on ANY Yang video ??? The people love him. Can‚Äôt wait to vote for him
#####
Donald Glover realized the truth:

Yang‚Äôs Freedom Dividend plan is to pay out a Universal Basic Income (UBI) with a Value-added tax (VAT), which is a consumption tax placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the supply chain, from production to the point of sale.

A VAT tax has already been applied to the supply chain in over 140 countries around the world, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, & the United Kingdom.
 
There is even a form of a VAT tax already in Alaska and Puerto Rico.

I love how jimmy has to laugh under is breath because the jokes are hilarious but slightly uncomfortable for him.

I don't understand why he hates celery.

0:14 Yes, how do you not know? He's the one who made all those annoying impeach trump ads. He's been doing it it way before he started running.
#####
I love him
#####
I'm convinced the only reason Yang isn't winning by a landslide is because not enough people knows he exists or even follow politics; that girl from the clip is a prime example. His ideas probably resonate with most people in the country, but ~40% of our population don't even know who's campaigning. If Yang wins, half the nation will think he's some random easter bunny, because no one paid attention.

#####
What‚Äôs the first three industrial revolutions?
#####
Andrew Yang 2020!
#####
He gets corrected by the ACTUAL statistics and then makes up his own.  

ROBOTS ARE NOT TAKING THE JOBS, you dumbass.

Those 300,000+ jobs went directly to India, Mexico, China and the middle east and NO ONE living in those countries will be better for it because of the wage gap when you ship a job overseas.

A HUMAN BEING WHO WILL DO THE WORK FOR SIX TIMES LESS IS MORE VALUABLE THAN A ROBOTIC ARM.

The economy he is modeling in his head is a total delusion based on consumerism being a growth constant and transcending to other countries. As though America's insane rate of consumption can A, be sustained and B, become grafted through out the world without widening income gaps.

The only new idea Yang has had is that he is spinning the Neo-conservative narrative in a new way:
 
"The workers are the bad guys, you cant regulate products or services so just let people buy crap, new targeted taxes (that I already know will never pass) are the answer and we should all trust in the power of singular corporations to make and effect laws, not the people."
#####
Entire industries that carry the majority of american jobs are being lost to automation and robotics not in 10 years, 5 years, but 2 years on average. None of these jobs are coming back. Pensions, retirement, benefits, stocks a worker payed for will continue to go unfullfulled, never rewarded, a total loss with the loss of even a tenured job. Having too much faith in corporations as the sole means for humans to acquire wealth and security is no longer an option. We need a new means of thriving or we are all toast.
#####
Everybody is praising how smart he is and how he's got all the data...can we just recognize how hard-working this guy is!?!!?  Imagine having to answer all the tough questions with REAL answers!  He must've spent so much time and energy trying to figure out what's going wrong in this country!  What a human being!
#####
Damn. When he said the future is coming like it or not that scared me, AI is coming people we need a true leader to guide us through this time
#####
Mathematical thinking is our next evolution
#####
I had a vision - Donald Trump will shock everyone by embracing Yang's UBI....most people greatly underestimate Trump
#####
You idiot's are going to vote yang I bet a million dallors hes a Chinese agent  China has already took over Hollywood notice there's a Chinese man in every new movie that has came out
#####
Don't forget to vote in the primaries. The pollsters are underestimating Yang. Sounds a lot like our last election, huh?? Lmao.
#####
yang the man
#####
Was there an earthquake happening during this interview or is the cameraperson a strong advocate for shaky cam in all types of scenes?
#####
All the big names in tech industries, renowned economists, engineers and scientists call it the fourth industrial revolution. Point this out in your next opportunity Yang
#####
Share Yang's videos on forums, with your friends and family share with everyone. People will come to their senses and realize how great he is, and that they're also tired of fake politicians with no regard for the people.
#####
Brainy head of state does not matter.  Can he talk street language that ordinary people can understand?  Is he a normal human with human emotions: happy, puzzled, excited, disappointed, funny, serious, etc?
Please ... No more robotic politicians.  The old pollies are not human.  They are fake puppets.  We want real people.
#####
If I was an American and I was able to vote.  I would vote for him.  Real talk!
#####
I tried to read as far down in the comments, and i can't even find one soul complaining or having a negative thought about this guy! Wow! If America can't see what's set before it, then i would know for sure, America is the dumbest country in the world! You can put Yang against anyone, and without doubt he should win, unless the voters have lost their minds.
#####
If the DNC can get out of their own arrogant way (which clearly and predictably did not work in their favor in 2016) and Yang can win the nomination, he will EASILY win 2020. This is the sentiment from sides.
#####
We need a first Asian conservative President in 2024 after Trump serves out his second term. Trump for 2020! üëåüèª
#####
The US and the world need a POTUS who clearly understands and offers sensible solutions to both old problems and 21st century challenges that humanity faces. Yang is the man. 
      Yang 2020.
#####
It‚Äôs so good to be Asian because you‚Äôre aware of how picky and skeptical people get with Asians so you mustn‚Äôt lie or cheat and must do 100% homework at all time

Very very big to BTC...Pay close attention

Warren is out of touch even asking for data...  go into a local grocery store and see the self check out...  go to Asia and see how everything is automated..
#####
Republicans and libertarians give Yang more exposure than his own party.
#####
CNN is being aggressive and a joke. Acting like they know whats happening, telling him he's wrong, when they dont know jackshit
#####
Dumb poor people be like: "i dont want a $1,000 a month because rich people like Jeff Bezos are getting it too." #selfishretards
#####
Very very big about to hammer BTC...Pay very close attention
#####
Freedom Dividend ( $1000/month for all adults ) is a right solution for the massive job loss due to automation.
Once adopted in USA, this will be adopted by other nations as well. And this will change the human history as a whole.
#####
It's just common sense. Whoever says automation is not the problem is in denial and idiotic ala Elizabeth Warren
#####
The rush to swap BTC for BCD
#####
Big traders are looking for BTC folks clones as better value . Google quantum computer is threat to BTC blockchain....
Overnight Google officially announced it's achieved "quantum supremacy", after one of its quantum computers solved a problem in 200 seconds that, the tech giant estimates, would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to solve.
#####
4:25

Trump: hello, Putin?
#####
WTF?  Europe, China, Japan, and people paying attention in America has been discussing the 4th industrial revolution since 2016???   Why is Yang the only candidate who knows about it in American politics?  Why does CNN think this is a new concept Yang invented???  Just how out of touch with reality are these MSM and politicians???  To think countries like Germany, Japan, China, Finland are already way ahead in this and CNN just heard it for the first time...  Is CNN based in North Korea or what?
#####
Very very big to hammer BTC.....Keep close watch
#####
He needs to get tougher and extra security for his food and windows
#####
You can‚Äôt fool Yang
#####
Um, Yang personally did not name it "The 4th Industrial Revolution", yo! Jesus Christ, how behind are you, CNN?!?!?!
#####
Dodges conflict and drama, straight to the point. Gotta admire that!
#####
Probably the most intelligent out of all the democrat candidates...
#####
I don‚Äôt know why but Andrew looks like a big dude in this interview
#####
The fourth industrial revolution exists
#####
America, this is who you want as our president. #Yang2020
#####
YANG GANG!!!
#####
Yang will lose the nominee because libtards never learn from history
#####
I don't understand why people like Yang so much
He's a follower of Milton Freeman.
Free-market  libertarianism has been a disaster wherever it's implemented.
#####
If you dems don‚Äôt get this guy as your candidate, you‚Äôre losing 2020 by a landslide
#####
Warren will flip flop to Yang Gang. She has no choice.
#####
Def the smartest candidate we had in a long time.
#####
I support Yang because it feels as though Im fighting for the underdog( the people that cant or wont show his ideas support). He wins and it will be a win for them too and some them would not even know that type of huge win was coming. Thank you Andrew Yang2020
#####
He's the right man but America is going to screw up and vote Trump because there to angry about the past and future .
#####
POWER POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
I‚Äôm excited at the prospect of a Yang Presidency.
America will benefit as a nation.
#####
Was originally going to vote for Donald Trump to quiet the Lefties. Now it isn't even about that. I'm just on board with Andrew Yang making America stronger again as a whole.
#####
This man should be at the top of the polls
#####
If you like Yang then text ‚ÄúYang‚Äù to 50409

Fuckin‚Äô commie
#####
Yang is the only one up there that I actually think is genuine about what he says.  Of course everyone should form their own opinions about these candidates but I ask people to not look at the party people associate with but what policies and differences they bring to the table.  Remember to be polite and fair to each other #yanggang #yang2020

The President has agreed to a medically correct procedure. A brain will be inserted into his skull. ooh boy. i hope this works.

UBI could be better than the current welfare system as long as its completely scrapped, along with the complete elimination of the minimum wage. But automation is not the problem.  Government labor laws, taxes, and regulations are killing jobs. Automation is mitigating the damage.
#####
"The studies I've seen say the exact opposite." NOT JUST THE ONE'S YOU'VE SEEN ANDREW. THE CONSENSUS IS CLEAR AND IF WARREN CAN'T SEE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIOECONOMIC TREND TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM OUR WAY OF LIFE, SHE'S NOT FIT TO BE IN OFFICE
#####
Andrew Yang. Big fan of this man
#####
this taiwanese descendant not becoming president more like a governor
#####
Gosh he‚Äôs a genius! Best candidate of all time let‚Äôs not blow this!
#####
Truth is, if you actually listen to Andrew Yang all other candidates seem outdated.
#####
I love how is thinking about both sides and is not against the opposition.
#####
Americunts are a bunch of racists , Andrew Yang got no chance , and US does not deserve.
#####
You think you have an argument against Yang but you don‚Äôt you really don‚Äôt. Just common sense shit with authenticity. You can not beat that. And another word, ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù
#####
Ladies and gentlemen you are witnessing a communist Coup of the most transparent presidency since JFK. Dont believe the lies cnn. Msnbc, NEW YORK TIMES  tell you. WAKE UP! Trump2020 üá∫üá∏ FREEEDOM!!!
#####
Whoever said to tax the
rich is stupid. It is like flogging a dead horse. Trump does not pay any taxes,
cannot even get to see his tax return. Amazon do not pay any taxes. VAT is the
way to go. With UBI trickling up, VAT is actually trickling down.
#####
If you want socialism vote for Andrew Yang.
#####
Lol this guy will destroy usa
#####
Yang has really caught my attention. He's the only one I've seen so far that is truly speaking up about Universal Basic Income, which we WILL NEED if we continue to evolve more into automation. I hope the DNC doesn't squash him out like they did with Bernie in the last election
#####
Even if he doesn't win, I hope he finds a place in the White House to help. We need him
#####
the only candidate speaks by facts and based on study compare to other candidates which speaks based on assumption and opinion.
#####
Go and donate to yang. Even a dollar counts and they count number of donors.
#####
If Yang does not win, he NEEDS to get on the VP ticket with Warren or Bernie. Maybe even moreso with Warren. He can be a great influence with them and even make their own policies more palatable to GOP Congress.
#####
in a parallel Universe the American people is smart enough to deserve him as president
#####
Yaaaaaang üí™üèªüí™üèª

This free everything argument is horseshit. The wealthy are the ones benefiting from handouts.  We live in Bizarro world, a world where the wealthy and solely the wealthy are entitled to handouts, in the form of tax cuts (no taxes) and everyone else pays their way. 
Wake up people.  You're getting fucked and have been for years.
#####
Maybe Warren hasn't been to a GM factory, Walmart or package sorting facility..Or maybe automation kills her candidacy?
#####
A VAT tax is already applied to the supply chain in over 140 countries around the world, including Brazil  China, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, & the United Kingdom.

Yang Unites  both Democrats  and Republicans.  You know its good  when BEN FUCKING  SHAPIRO   calls Yang " my boy"

Yang and Gabbard would be an unbeatable ticket.  Tulsi would make up for his obvious deficiency in foreign policy experience and would appeal to female voters.  Trump wouldn't be able to beat Yang in a debate.  He already has the other democratic candidates wary of even challenging his ideas. 

Be smart and make this happen, America!
#####
Yang would kill Trump in a debate
#####
Super happy to see more people turning in and hearing about yang! Can‚Äôt wait for him to be our future president
#####
At this point, anyone still going for Warren or Biden is a sheep
#####
It like pulling on a yin yang  every time this guy talks
#####
Andrew Yang is Amazing. Screw all the other democratic candidates.
#####
As an Australian looking from an outside perspective, this man seems to be the most sensible democrat candidate. Do not screw this up America.
#####
Yang knows what he is doing. Let‚Äôs get this man in office!
#####
It‚Äôll be my first time voting. Parents very conservative. Would consider myself in the middle leaning conservative but think that voting for just one party no matter what is kind of stupid. Yang seems to be the best option in my opinion
#####
Makes sense
#####
Ever since Yang started talking at all I instinctively saw he was a corporate Trojan Horse Gig Economy, anti-progressive.
#####
What good is healthcare when a doctor refuses to believe you have Tapeworm unless you have visited a third world country ?
#####
I liked Yang until I found out he had bewn lying about Medicare for all the whole time.
#####
this is a load. he is lying by using "medicare for all". the best case scenario he is proposing is a "medicare public option". health insurance companies make money by denying coverage. the only way medicare can compete with them is by also denying coverage. this is completely pointless basically making the whole plan a scam to keep health insurance companies chugging along and making more money. understand that health insurance companies are fancy products that basically do the accounting and pockets billions in profits by denying coverage. they DO NOT provide healthcare. health insurance companies are completely unnecessary. US govt will provide the insurance through medicare for all. just like all big companies, medicare will have a magnitude higher bargaining power in the world because they will be bargaining on behalf of 300 million americans and get the best prices on drugs. as usual nbc covering his lies. "more access" but not more coverage. more insurance plans in the market plans doesn't mean you get better coverage. medicare for all will have better coverage with lower cost. this is a blatant corporate talking point. please pay attention to what they are not saying.
#####
He calls it Medicare for all but it‚Äôs not, just lying to get votes, his plan isn‚Äôt really all that bad imho just wish he had more integrity like Sanders. Also, the ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù option (which is just Obamacare 2.0) isn‚Äôt much of a solution either, we will just end up with a slightly different way to pay a lot of money for healthcare because demand is inelastic and people will STILL go bankrupt from medical bills. He‚Äôs not the worst, just too little too late and of course better than the current potus
#####
Can anyone explain how a independent private doctor would get a salary?
#####
His health care idea is abysmal. The actual solution to health care is a single payer universal system. This... "Public option" concept has been tried in other countries and has failed massively due to the fact that the private health insurance companies refer as many sick people to the public health care system as possible while taking in as many healthy people as possible, which reduces the homoscedasticity of the populous causing increased costs per capita and wait times within the public system.
#####
go yang go
#####
Andrew Yang is a true problem solver.   If the problem is needing more money in your pocket then put it in our hands not some trickle down crap.
#####
Yang Gang ! let‚Äôs have it
#####
Yang looks at the root causes of the problem. I like that.
#####
He had hardly any name recognition to now beating career politicians. If he pulls this off and becomes president, i believe he will make true to most all of his campaign promises.
#####
#yang2020 #blackwomenforyang
#####
Yang is just like OBAMA who keep deceiving US and themselves also. They talk a lot of nonsense plans that will never work. For examples, all Obama's plans fail miserably up to now especially his Obama care. When he was President he can't hardly accomplished his plans successfully. He kept blaming others of his failures because of his incompetent and lack of technical skills as President. He keep spending and did not get any results as he promises. I sincerely believe Yang will follows the same path as Obama and definitely will screw up more where Obama left off.
#####
Yang is rad.
#####
Yang is right. There‚Äôs enough money in health care to give Americans the best health care in the world.  Just have to redesign the rules to serve the people.
#####
I support universal medical system. "Free market system" with many small insurance companies failed to provide basic consumer protection and must be reformed and transformed into single payer system with free market. Well known problem in many medical plans: pre-existing conditions denial, don't cover basic/essential health problems, bankruptcy of people/families who even had medical insurance, problems with payment for out of network providers in emergencies, huge/unreasonable deductibles, fine prints in contact, very low annual limit, service denial, etc. Add to above the highest prices in the world we are paying for services and medications.
#####
Majority of Canadian, Australians, Britons, Israelis and many other developed countries are satisfied with their health care system, but the majority of Americans are not satisfied with the healthcare system.
#####
It cost employers about 5$ an hour/employee to provide health insurance.  A progressive tax could pay for the universal health care and the 5$ could be put on workers checks.
#####

#####
This is the only time I'm really proud of the Asian stereotype of being good in math and Mr. Yang is slaying this statistics game. Please vote for him, dear Americans. He can solve your scary math problems. He can lead the world into an elevated existence ‚ú® he can usher our generation to finally live more dignified lives.
#####
Andrew Yang for President!
#####
If I see a Yang video, I watch it.
#####
A public option that allows insurance company's to pick the healthiest individuals.
But the public option bit is forced to take the sickest which drives up the cost.

IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Salaries for doctors?? I'm no doctor, but that's stupid, socialized medicine that removes or reduces doctor give-a-shit. That won't end well for patients.
The SOLUTION is a single payer payroll tax FUND for hospital bills, and cash or private insurance for the rest, WITH a standardized, progressive out of pocket yearly maximum for every household. THIS IS THE SOLUTION.
AND, 22 million illegals start paying their fair share instead of clogging emergency rooms.
This SOLUTION saves $30 billion dollars right out of the gate.
Americans are turkey-stuffed goofy stupid.
#####
So why is MSNBC silencing him? He makes so much sense!
Is it just racism? I'm confused.

Yang lost me with his, "I'll give you $100". If you have Blue Cross Blue Shield. They tell the doctors or hospital what they will pay. If you have medicare it will will tell the doctor what it will pay. When I had Blue Cross Blue Shield they told me if the doctors try to bill you more tell us.
The model has been set all we have to do is implement it. Yang is not good for being a leader of the country.

Yang is the only one focusing on addressing the root problems of the healthcare system. Single payer would eliminate competition but history proves monopoly is never the best for the people whether the service is provided by government or cooperations. Think DMV and PG&E. Yang‚Äôs on the right track to create an efficient system to make healthcare accessible, available and affordable to everyone without sacrificing quality, which is enhanced by competition.

Don't forget people Andrew Yang is a Non-profit entrepreneur. he was never going to sell anything for billions of dollars like all of the for-profit Entrepreneurs because be never made anything worth billions of dollars to somebody but what he did make is billions of dollars into your communities with his non-profit work. His net worth is around 2-3 million USD which after 15 years of work puts him in the upper middle class position at best. he is like us not a guy with endless supply of money to not worry about anything.

Bernie: ‚ÄúPeople are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. Vote for me, and i‚Äôll tax 60%+ of your income, and then provide you with a government job, House, healthcare, food, and college.‚Äù

Andrew Yang: ‚ÄúI believe you know what‚Äôs best for your own life. You‚Äôre competent enough to improve your situation if the resources and tools are readily available to  you.. and I believe the freedom to make decisions is important to become smarter and stronger. Instead of taxing everyday American‚Äôs annual income, i‚Äôm going to implement a transactional tax that falls less heavily on consumer stables and more heavily on luxury goods and services. Instead of using that money to fund the military industrial complex, i‚Äôm Going to Inject that money directly into our families and communities in the form of a dividend. This will spark consumer activity nationwide, especially in rural communities where opportunity is hard to come by. This will recognize the work of artists, stay at home parents, caregivers and volunteers. This will help minorities start businesses, and help give women leverage to escape a bad relationship or take care of her children. We are the most wealthy and advanced economy in the world holding the number 1 spot at 21 trillion GDP. It‚Äôs not a matter if we can afford it. We can. It‚Äôs my job to change this mindset of scarcity that America has been conditioned to believe, to a mindset of abundance. We must rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work for us, to protect us from the ever increasing invasive ness of artificial intelligence and automation. It‚Äôs not left, it‚Äôs not right, it‚Äôs forward. That‚Äôs where I plan on taking this country, America.‚Äù

Many prominent economists, politicians, and visionaries have talked about UBI but no one has been able to propose an acceptable way to fund it. Yang's bold proposal of VAT-funded UBI and Human Centered Capitalism will transform the nation, and he should get nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in economics. Let's work on that!

Democrats think the Nordic countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are countries America should emulate.. I agree, and that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm voting for Yang and not Bernie. These countries continue to grow their nuclear energy capacity because of it‚Äôs efficiency and success, they have a private insurance market on top of their universal health care system, and they don‚Äôt have a wealth tax but instead a VAT because a wealth tax has proven to be a failure. Bernie obviously can‚Äôt learn from these country‚Äôs past mistakes. He‚Äôs stuck in the 20th century. I can‚Äôt blame him.. he‚Äôs old and stubborn. Andrew Yang however, is the 21st century candidate we need.

Definitely not appropriate to force your interviewee to donate and it's not like Yang is rich as well. Some of you maybe even make more money than he does as he has been doing a Non profit for the last 7 years helping America and now in a greatest effort for all Americans.

I rock with this guy...signed up on his website!! now let's get it

President Yang!!!
#####
To anyone against UBI, if you think letting Zuckerberg, Bezos and other tech giants hold on to trillions of dollars each year will somehow trickle down to us, then you've lost connection with how the current economy works. Mark and Jeff aren't creating new jobs with those trillions. They are investing in new ways to automate away even more of the jobs that still exist.

The advancement of technology has been killing and will continue to kill the trickle down economy. Trickle down is already over at the highest levels of the economy and it is never returning at those levels due to automation and other technologies. As technology becomes more sophisticated, trickle down will stop working at lower and lower levels of the economy. Trickle down will only work at the very lowest levels (mom and pop, vocational, etc.) in the future. UBI is the only way for humanity to benefit off of technology going forward. You have to come to terms with the fact that technology can already do our work as well as we can in many cases and will only get better at it over time. There is literally no issue with letting everyone benefit off of technology. No one is getting hurt by it unless you think data servers, software, computer chips and robots have feelings.

Bingo Trump won‚Äôt show his taxes because the government probably wasn‚Äôt making him pay as much as he should just like they‚Äôre letting Amazon google all these big oil companies electric companies get away with paying hardly any tax it all what do you think?
#####
If you want to talk empressive remember he answered questions for 10 hours straight without a laptop notes or teleprompter.

This means that his ideas are truly his and not fed to him by someone else.

Isn't that the type of person we want in politics? Can you think of any other person running that can or would do the same?

I guess Trump pays less taxes than most of us. Most billionaires don't have income like most of us. Their wealth is built on investments in companies and other assets and is taxed differently than the money you make from working.

Thank you for the wonderful coverage on Andrew Yang #YangGang2020
#####
Yang supporters are hilarious. One minute he‚Äôs not getting enough coverage. Yang has been on every mainstream platform that exists.The next minute, he‚Äôs getting unfair coverage or loaded questions. What‚Äôs an unfair question? There‚Äôs no such thing as an unfair question. Yang is just a one trick pony.

Yang drops to 2% in new poll. His first Medicare For All ad is raising criticism as Yang no longer supports M4A.  People are calling him "Inauthentic" and saying he is misleading people into thinking Yang supports M4A.  

Yang still lists M4A on his website but no longer supports it.

He needs to come up with his own plan, name it, and go forward.

Check poll here:

Great fair coverage of Yang

He probably hasn‚Äôt turned them in to force media coverage üòâ inciting negativity because, there is no such thing as bad publicity(proven after trump), his returns will be clean and through this people are ‚Äúattacking‚Äùhim and putting him in the media. 
In short, he did the Math.
#####
People just need to dig thru his facts and proposals and will realize that President Andrew Yang is correct or mostly correct.   

I like Yang because he‚Äôs not a politician, he seems to be more like the nice neighbor down the street.  He much wiser with his choose of words when publicly speaking.   He always seem to have a good come back with somebody try to attack him in his idealogy.

The first president to bring up robots and automation 

And now other candidates are kinda talking about it too just like him. 

He‚Äôs smart, a lawyer, a business-man, a father, a loving husband to his wife.  

Not to mention he can skateboard and show up at a music festival, actually he‚Äôs been on many many talk shows, and now on TVs.   The TV media will try to blur or cut Andrew Yang out of the picture when they can.
#####
i love this clip
#####
Yang 2020!

Finally
#####
Enthusiasm is fine, but an appearance of cult-like zealotry, which some of his back-and-forth exchanges with his supporters may suggest at rallies, may put off undecided voters. Yang also needs to always remind himself not to pull a "Howard Dean" in order to maintain some measure of gravitas in keeping with his visions and messages.
#####
Besides his great policies, YangGang is moving forward and bring people together.
#####
A good strategy... calculated timing on the releasing of tax returns... in order to get some media's attention and airtime!  Andrew Yang 2020.

yang is the most viable candidate.  Once media covers him, you'll see the polls bump.  The voting demographics he's had to target due to the media ignorance are ages 18-24 through social media and considered 'unlikely voters' by pollsters.  A better sense of his support is individual donors and rally turnout, both of which are growing at steady rates.

It would take a 31% to 40% VAT on almost everything people spend money for, to make this work. It would take 31% VAT on most goods and services and on data, plus the savings from other welfare programs to give 200M of the 247, 813,910 estimated adults in the US, $1000/mo. To fund all the adults would take 40%.  Please check this and tell me if you find errors. MATH ‚ò∫

How much is needed to give everyone $1000/mo?

‚û°To give every estimated adult in the US,  $1000/mo, then $3T per year is needed.

247,813,910 √ó $12000 = $2,973,766,920,000 which rounds to $3T is needed.

What would it cost for 200M to receive $1000/mo?

‚û°To give 200M people $1000/mo, then $2.4T is needed.

 200M √ó $12,000 = 2,4000,000,000,000,  $2.4T needed.

Since VAT is a consumer tax let's look at how much consumers spent to find out how much revenue could be made by taxing it. (Business to business transactions unless one is the final customer yield 0% VAT revenue. A short video that gives a simple explanation of how this works in the EU is, "What is VAT and how does it work? Will's Whiteboard" The channel is Avalara. )

The total consumer spending for 2018, was $12.9T. If we subtract housing (2.2T), healthcare (2.2), food (1T), and clothes (0.4), then we are left with  $7.1T. Let's  take 10% of that. It's .$0.7T.  (710B) 

So the amount generated from taxing 10% of all goods and services except rent/mortgage, groceries, clothes, and medical, would be $710B. That's still taxing 10% of every pizza order, Netflix, car payment, home repair, vacation, haircut, yachts, etc equals $710B. ($0.7T)

If there was a Data tax. Data is between 100B to 200B industry, now. Let's say 200B. 10% of 200B is $20B. ($0.02T)

So now we have 710B + 20B =730B.  

‚û°Let's figure in government savings from other welfare programs. The freedom-dividend website figured out the amount from savings on welfare programs to be $161.57B. The UBI Center figured the number to be 151B. We'll take the $161.57B for this estimate.

 161.57B+730B = 891.57B

Now the new total is 891.57B

‚û°The revenue generated from 10% VAT + 10% DataTax + gov't savings = $891.56B

Let's suppose everyone opted in how much would that give each one per month?

$891.57B  √∑ 257,813,910 = $3597.74 √∑12 = $299.81/mo

What about if only 200M people opt in?

891.57B √∑200M = $4457.85 √∑12= $371/mo

‚û°What would it take with a VAT and data tax, plus savings from welfare to get the $2.4T, so 200M people could opt in?

 7.1T consumer spending + 0.2T(data) √ó .31(VAT) = 2.26T + 0.16157T (savings) = $2.4T

It would take savings from existing welfare programs plus a 31%VAT on data and 31% on every good and service except health care, rent/mortgage, food and clothes to get the number close to the $2.4T. The amount needed to give 200M people a check for $1000/mo

The 31% VAT would cut consumer sales, so I doubt it would work out to actually generate that amount, though. 

The US Census Bureau estimates there are 247,813,910 of adults in US, (not all are citizens). How many would opt in? If everyone did. It would be ~ $3T in checks sent out. ($29,737,669,200,000)

‚û°What would it require for every adult to get $1000/mo? 

7.1T(consumer spending) + 0.2T (data) √ó .40 (VAT)  + .16157 (gov't savings) = $3.0T
So it would take a 40% VAT on  most spending and on data plus the savings from welfare.

People would run out of money to buy things and not buy enough to fund it if there was a 31% to 40% VAT.

Another thing that would work mathematically is if prices were was 3 to 4 times higher and then a 10% VAT was added onto the price. People would run out of money first .

Another mathematical option is for everyone to buy 3 to 4 times more of almost everything. People would run out of money first.

If it remained at 10% and was therefore, not fully funded, it would require borrowing money and giving that borrowed money to the consumers to spend. Beside increasing the $22T national debt that has to be paid back with interest to bond holders, it requires increasing the money supply or "printing money" and handing it out. This causes inflation. Prices rise. 

If over 2/3 of the $2.4T to $3T is unfunded that means over 2/3 of it is printed money dumped into the consumer market.  At the top amount that would be 2T more money into a $12.9T consumer market place. That would make the dollar worth less. Like anything else, scarcity makes something more valuable and excess diminishes the value of it.

It creates "too much money chasing too few goods" which is the definition of inflation. (Prices rise)

Consumers having this much more money would cause a lot more demand for goods and services than supply. That makes prices rise to cut the demand to a more manageable amount for suppliers to meet. How much would prices rise?  They could rise a lot especially in things like rent, used car prices, vacations spots, and highly sought after items like designer athletic shoes. 

To see how demand and supply effect prices, Economist Thursday, in 2014,  made a cartoon video to explain why it doesn't work to hand out money to everyone.  It Is a short engaging video, that explains this. I put it on a playlist, too, if you're interested. It's called, "Why Don't We Print More Money?" It focuses more on the demand and supply cause of the prices rising than the money printing part of it. For that apart, I like  the video "Inflation explained in 1 minute", by One Minute Economist . 

They are both oversimplified, but informative. IMO. Both are on a playlist on my channel with videos explaining how the VAT in the EU works, if you want easy access to them. Don't worry, I don't make videos. These aren't partisan videos. They were all made prior to the election cycle. ‚ò∫

PS. How much would administration costs be? I didn't include them because I didn't know how to make an accurate estimate. Any ideas for doing this? 

This involves dealing with all the companies to collect it and audit it, prevent fraud, and screen applicants, distribute it accurately to every eligible adult who opts in and get funds from other welfare programs. 

Also fraud. How much would fraud cost? How to prevent it?
#####
Only smart and pure thinking,not politics can and will make America  Dream comes true. All the way with Yang!

He is the Democrat that can appeal to the republican voters. If yang don't win the democratic, those Republicans are gonna vote trump and the dem nom has a lower chance to win

Basically every Democrat planning to vote for a democratic candidate will vote for one of the democratic leaders against trump. But the man with the most Republican voters would vote for besides trump is Yang. DO THE MATH!

Mr. Yang,
   The reason I support you isn‚Äôt because I necessarily believe in the freedom dividend. I think it‚Äôs a very interesting idea and it could work. However, I‚Äôm not qualified to say. However, I do believe you have correctly identified the problem which is the vast automation of all low skilled labor in the United States. It‚Äôs a profound insight, you are correct and, you‚Äôre the only candidate on the field who makes sense.  I‚Äôm fully behind you.
           -John

Shouldn't those jobs move into service jobs instead of nothing?
#####
And he kisses his rice cooker  with that egotistical mouth?
#####
You can do math, vulgarity is no substitute for wit. ü§®
#####
The VAT on automated goods and services like online shopping, electronics and other luxury goods will incentivize people to shop local over online as well as pay for the Freedom Dividend. This will increase local consumption, which will create millions of jobs for local commerce like daycare workers, mechanics, plumbers, waiters and other jobs that won't be replaced by automation any time soon. Yang's Freedom Dividend and VAT will create millions of real organic local jobs instead of made up federal jobs.

As for the future of automation, as automation advances and continues to produce more of the goods and services within the economy, the VAT on those goods and services will generate more revenue which means the Freedom Dividend will increase proportionally with automation over time. The Freedom Dividend and VAT literally makes automation work for Americans instead of for a handful of billionaires. As the Freedom Dividend continues to allow Americans to keep local commerce booming, there will be millions of local jobs in the meantime. By the time automation reaches the point where it can do even local jobs like daycare, plumbing, waitressing, etc., the VAT on automated goods and services will already be generating enough revenue to be paying Americans several thousands of dollars a month through the Freedom Dividend. This is how we turn automation from a problem into a solution. This is how we transition into a post-scarcity economy and usher in an age of unheard of entrepreneurship, community building, charity work, research and science, art and philosophy.

The whole fucken war in Iraq costed us Anerican taxpayers 7 trillion dollars you clown!   And you think that 1.3 dollars that will go back to our economy in taxes and wages is unrealistic you clown?

They will not let him make policy!  The freedom dividend takes money from mega corporations and they do not permit  that!
#####
Yang is playing Santa to win an election. His unstated purpose is to expropriate all the middle class people like me. When he's taken everything we have, and destroyed the productive class in this country, he will simply print money.
His freeloader supporters will stick with him as long as that check keeps coming, however little it will buy.
#####
Amazing how many yang gangsters on here backing him up on cbs own channel that‚Äôs making him look bad. Obviously he is backed by more than the media is letting on. Honestly people just never sat and listened to a 10 minute video about how cool of a potus this man will be. Also a guy like me who never voted is donating and voting. I bet there will be a lot of first timers casting ballots !

Alright I‚Äôm with the Yang Gang! Love it!
#####
Yang for President 2020 !
#####
Many decades and dems presidents have come and go they all promised to end poverty but more and more Americans are getting poorer and have been neglected. Yang will improve the lives of the Americans.
#####
Funny how every demonrat debate has been won by .........Trump
#####
longshot?? he was only 12-1 odds to become potus. hed be way above 15-1 if he was a longshot. might have to put down 10k on this election lol
#####
Humanity first!
Yang in 2020 üóΩüëä
#####
4:08
#####
Chances arent that low, lets propose for one second that we vote top 5 today: Sanders, Biden, Warren, Buttigeg, Yang, Divide amongst them the blue states and their all fairly equal, Decide the red states and you have a much narrower choice between Yang and someone else, remember, Yang is one of two canidates with more then 10% of Trump supporters, thats 50% chance of winning 10% of the states, which means Yang if elected nominee would win all the blue states and 20 to 30% of the Red states with the other ex Trump supporters who no longer follow one of the other dems now that their out of the race, giving him a much higher advantage against Trump, not so unlikely now
#####
Yang is thinkiing out of the box if multinational data firms get money from our information should the originators of that data be compensated
#####
4:26 This advisor has a problem saying 2.4 Trillion dollars to help Americans. But has no issue with bailing out Wall Street with 4 TRILLION dollars without national debate. On top of that, TRILLION dollar American online companies are paying NO TAXES? Guess who's payroll he's on. Hmmm.....
#####
Keep giving him airtime. We love Yang
#####
I hate when politicians run for president, they do what the rich CEOs want them to do.
#####
What a waste of funds.
#####
It almost physically hurts me to continue seeing him under double digits.
#####
#yanggang
#####
The DNC won't let yang win, just like with sanders in 2016
#####
Yang should run for president of Hong Kong....haaa.  3 %. #TrumpTrain2020 ü§ó
#####
So UBI is being paid for by us through retail taxes. Nothing is free. Don't be fooled. Look at countries that have tried it. IT FAILS!!! Because alot of people don't spend their money wisely. That is why there is over a billion dollars in credit card debt.
#####
Yang 2020 = Renaissance 2.0. Time for age of abundance.
#####
Hope yang knocks all the other candidates off their feet. Our only hope.

The rest seem more of the same! Yang has an interesting story!

The only democrat I would possibly vote for
#####
Yang gang 2020 2024
#####
His ideas might sound outrageous, but we really need some out-of-the-box thinkers to run things in this country, otherwise, we are going down.
#####
i can't believe people are rejecting $1000/month to vote for someone other then yang
#####
Yang is whats gonna make America great cares for humanity I love being a us citizen can‚Äôt wait for yang
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 

In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also, make sure that you're registered to vote!!

Please LIKE this comment to make sure the message gets delivered :)
#####
As a Trump supporter I find Yang interesting.
#####
Is the Yang gang same as occupy Wallstreet?
#####
Yang is the only real competition to Trump at this point and the DNC will push Warren. Come back in 2024 Yang and it‚Äôs yours for the taking. 

Signed, a trump voter.
#####
‚ù§Ô∏è #AndrewYang
#####
Turning into a yang gang supporter i think
#####
Please USA pick this dude
#####
Yang we support you please continue to encourage support (STEM) education in all committees and countries
#####
He makes sense.
#####
Andrew Yang has done the MATH!!
#####
hey yang gang! he needs 40000 before the tonight's debate and he only needs 783 left before tonight at 8pm, let's do this!
#####
Yang doesn't even get it.  He has to RENAME capitalist consumerism into something else.  YES, he is all about humanity first, BUT capitalism is NOT about humanity first it's about individuals over the group.  What Yang wants to do is change capitalism, not radically like communism but it's still a HUGE change.  So he needs to RENAME his form of capitalism and stop saying he likes capitalism the way it is because HE AND ALL HIS FOLLOWERS DO NOT.  And they don't understand this.  GDP= health and life expectancy?  That IS NOT capitalism at it's purest.  So he should RENAME his form of capitalism whether it's "human first capitalism" or something else it must be renamed from capitalist consumerism because ALL ELSE FOLLOWS.  Behavior follows the values of a culture
#####
CBS is very misleading on the VAT tax part. They make it look like essentials are taxed from talking about it during a Target purchase... If they cared to research Yangs policy, they‚Äôd see that clothing and groceries are not included
#####
‚Äúunlikely campaign‚Äù... CBS y‚Äôall be hating, lmao!
#####
I
#####
Thank you for covering @andrewyang #yanggang #yang2020
We are just going to prove to all that he is for real, electable and the perfect person to beat Donald Trump. #humanityfirst
#####
Don't believe the polls!  LOL remember when HIllary was projected to win?

Trust your eyes -- obviously Yang is the favorite candidate (this is also confirmed by Google Trends and search histories)

I think we can be sure that Yang has a chance to win so much of the popular vote, even the delegates can't pick Trump.  I mean popular vote vs. delegates vote doesn't always match, but if Yang can win by a landslide they'll have no choice.

LOL at CBS's bias title "unlikely campaign" STFU CBS
#####
American people from the left and right are so sick  of the political establishment. Out of the three anti-establishment candidates, Bernie, Tulsi, and Yang, Yang is the only one who will beat Trump.
#####
He did the math I did the math we all did the math if he doesn‚Äôt get the nominee then trump wins in a landslide election the only people who haven‚Äôt done the math is the people who don‚Äôt know who he is and the media who omits him from their polls
#####
Yang is so fresh.
#####
How much will UBI cost on an annual basis?
#####
Yang for president! Remember to vote !
#####
Yang is the way forward!
#####
if each person in the us over 18 gets 1000 a month and the population is 327.2 million right now of 12/29/19 and every adult in the us takes about 70% of that population that would be rough math of around 3 trillion dollars every year i like the idea just seems hard 2 do!
#####
How can they give 338 million people 1,000 a month thats 338 billion a month, that's 4 trillion a year lol. Dummies.
#####
It takes a man like Andrew with a bold vision to lead this broken country that is supposedly the richest but least respected and most divided across the globe. We need drastic changes and Andrew Yang is the right man for the job.
#####
üß†+‚ù§Ô∏è=Yangüß¢ !!!!
#####
My babies' mommas get about $646/month.  They would better off with $1,000/month.
#####
The math on this is very simple.  Despite the devastating cost, let's consider this in an economic model.  It'll take about 6-9 months to start paying out consumers, in which time every single Fortune 500 will have a strategy to get that money back from you.  Then, local and small business will raise their prices.  This "freedom" bull!@#$ UBI really is just universal welfare that will rise costs because that's how economics works.  I'm not an economist, but it's common sense that it cheapens currency and doesn't solve the problem of tying the dollar to real perceived value + work.  

The real solution is to get the government's books in order with the same tax solutions Yang proposes, and then incentivize real competition and new forms of supply.  The problem with this Yang guy is that he encourages consumerism, not the American worker.
#####
This is when its only Andrew and himself there's no yanggang yet lol
#####
its like getting a raise!
#####
Thank you for covering Yang. Though I would like to politely remind Yahoo to keep up with the news. Yang is gaining traction and nationally polling at #6 as of early December 2019.
#####
This is Bullshit fake news old af article. Yang changed it to 18-death over half a yr ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yahoo is an enemy of real journalism and actual information apparently. Why are you rereleasing this??? Yang Gang üß¢ü¶Ö
#####
He realy looks younger
#####
Great interview!
#####
Good job Yahoo.
#####
Andrew Yang's "freedom dividend" is everything but free.  It's just shifting the burden (read: taxes) on higher income earners.
#####
Oh...he's catching on.

üß¢‚ù§üß¢‚ù§
#####
Yahoo please bring him back on! Andrew Yang for the win üß¢
#####
AndrewYang GO
#####
this guy will be serving me cocktails after election - that's what i see through a crystal ball
#####
Yahoo! needs to do a new interview with Yang.
#####
Nice to see our man has been on point and on message the whole time.  Yang 2020.
#####
Yes to your mind, no to the freedom dividend we can‚Äôt afford that right now to do long term ramifications unless you have a very specific detailed plan on how you can pay without screwing up the counter which strikes at the elite organizations who fund the earth which indirectly funds the job production of citizenry.
#####
Go YANGGANG Go!!!shoot em from orbit!!! Yea!!   YANGGANG2020 üá∫üá∏üß¢ü¶Ö
#####
This is an old interview. The policy was made broader between the recording and posting. Seems odd that they are just now releasing a months old interview.
#####
It is not 18 to 64!
It is 18 to death !
#####
How he gonna give every 325milion American 1,000$ when we already at 22trilion debt?
#####
How easily he convinces even the most skeptical that his ideas are at least worth considering. If you haven't looked into Andrew Yang before, the primaries are drawing near; now is the time. He's the only man with that combination of IQ, EQ, and T(ech)Q we have ever seen this close to the White House, and we may never get the chance again.
#####
So funny she mentioned Sam Altman, who has endorsed Andrew Yang since this aired last year.
#####
He actually doesn‚Äôt answer the questions!
#####
18 to death now
#####
My boss doesn't ask or regulate how I use my paycheck..
#####
I love it!
#####
Y'all LATE though
#####
This is incredibly outdated...
#####
ok i couldnt understand ubi til 64.   its for life
#####
Vote for Andrew Yang
#####
yang2020
#####
Yang changed the age limit 18 - to the day you expire. This interview is like a yr ago
#####
Some here say Yahoo Finance needs a new interview with Andrew Yang. I see a man, a candidate, who remains consistent with his message. Look at some of the other candidates, who have changed their message. Bernie and Tulsi are like Andrew Yang, consistent with their message and ideas. Andrew Yang wants Americans to help America, a simple idea. Can we please bump the record player to get out of our grove.
#####
Mainstream media: "He's not polling high enough to have a shot in hell to win." 
Common sense: Yea because you keep omitting him from graphics, polls and debate speaking time.
#####
Couldn't watch beyond the opening - immediately realized this must be an old interview since Andrew Yang has already modified his stance on the Freedom Dividend - it's $1k for every American til they die not 65.
#####
Now can you interview Bernie please

After I see a Yang video I get motivated not just to support him politically but in my own life.
#####
They are leaving him off of polls and ballots making pols mandatory and ifnoring him at debates  if youve seen his rallies and fundraisers you probably realized how rigged our elections are but never got angry before because every other candidate has been bad.
#####
Democrat is peace  maker, we all know if war 3 erupt is aint good for anyone
#####
He knows he wont win. But it's a perfect way to promote his person and businesses.
Even Bernie made millions from running, because of his book. Yang  is going to probably gain even more.
#####
Its not until 64! It‚Äôs until death! üò°
#####
Good for him
#####
with $1000 a month the interviewer can afford a new jeans that doesn't have two giant holes in the knee area..
#####
Smart man, but not so smart with some of the things he does during his campaign.
#####
Please update with a 2019 interview
#####
Suspend your disbelief. This man wants to give you $1000/month while he goes about solving an array of other serious problems.  Tell your friends, make sure you are registered to vote in the Primaries.
#####
Why not 65?
#####
It's $1000 a month for only 1 year. It's called temporary solution just like QE.
#####
ANDY RANDY YANG.  THE WHIPPED CREAM THING, IS THAT SOME METAPHOR OR SYMBOLISM THAT YOU VOTED FOR BILL CLINTON. THE ONLY THING, WHY ARE YOU ON THE TRAIL WITH WHIPPED CREAM OR HAD TO USE IT UP BECAUSE DONNIE LE MON MISSED HIS INTERVIEW....SNOWED IN WITH FREDO.
#####
It's until death... Not 65.
#####
Yang2020
The American Scorecard need attention
People kill themselves around the holidays
This mechanism can spotlight awareness
Perhaps we can find lasting solutions one day
#####
old interview?? only because they can monetize this.... talk about corporate greed
#####
Why did they upload an old interview? Because Andrew Yang can attract a lot of views?
#####
go yang!
#####
Damn........2018
#####
He correctly points out the drawbacks of automation but never ever in one of his interviews did he mention about the benefits of AI, technologies and automation.
#####
WTF Yahoo, a video from 2018! He‚Äôs changed the Freedom Dividend so that it‚Äôs 18->death. Stop spreading misinformation.
#####
Same old snake oil in a new fancy bottle for new customers, peddled this time by an Asian salesman wearing a hat that makes you think harder for the government instead for yourselves.
#####
It's really nice to see an interview panel with this level of maturity: no shouting over each other, no interruptions.  Good job, Y!F.
#####
YANG,  ALL LOBBYISTS WILL NEED TO LEAVE WASHINGTON.   NO MORE BRIBERY OF CONGRESSMAN FOR THEIR FOUNDATION!
#####
YANG,  please RESUSCITATE THESE RUIN CITIES ALL OVER AMERICAN.   WAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAD MADE ALL CITIES IN AMERICA LOOK WAR THROWN (houses boarded up, stores closed in poor neighborhood,  POT HOLES IN TO, TOO STREETS,  AND SO ON.
#####
Nice try Yahoo Finance. Details are that important anyway. LOL MATH
#####
I love how Kamala Harris arrogantly laughed at him during a debate for this, only to start polling lower than him and drop out before Iowa.
#####
Very compelling indeed.
#####
I recognize Andrew's old haircut... bring him on the show again!
#####
Guess what happens when you give everyone an extra $1000 per month. Companies raise their prices on everything because they figure everyone has $1000 extra every month. The problem is, they will ALL raise their prices. So the net result is people will suffer more. Look at the fiasco of Obamacare. Once insurance companies realized the government was going to subsidize healthcare, healthcare costs increased, covered services decreased, deductibles skyrocketed. Yang may be okay with math, but he doesn't know crap about capitalist culture. Give more free crap, the market will demand more.
#####
These questions are simply wrong and miss the mark big time.  So sad too bad.
#####
This video is a bit old and disingenuous in making assumptions laced in the questions.
#####
Yahoo boardroom: All of our reporters are currently dedicated to writing smear articles or biased reporting on Andrew Yang...  but he‚Äôs so trending right now, so let‚Äôs repost a year-old interview to get the revenues while we re-hash old skepticism.
#####
Wonder why they reposting.
#####
Freedom Dividend is for 18 year old thru the entire life.
#####
Got some nerve running this old interview after the crap your pundits have said about Yang and his policies in the past.
#####
Nice interview great Yahoo and I like yahoo let‚Äôs help yanggang yahoo pls
#####
Why are you posting this 2018 clip today? Click-hungry?
#####
this interview is more than 18 months old... whhhhhaa

I can‚Äôt wait to vote for this guy üá∫üá∏üß¢

No dummy, the populism was inspired by Bernie Sanders. Jesus Christ the MSM suck.

I think Andrew was undressing Melanie with his eyes.  ;-)

Andrew knows MATH. I can't wait for my data check in the mail. In YANG I trust ..
#####
Gotta drop the Zack Gooseman clips at the end. I‚Äôm sick of hearing him try to get me subscribed. IM ALREADY SUBSCRIBED!!! STOP OR ILL UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!
#####
Boy, Yang is the smart person.
#####
Old interview. Update  policy =UBI will be from age 18 until you die. Yahoo has had some of the most negative stories about Andrew Yang. This interview was straight down the middle which is likely why they never aired it. Now they put it on YouTube because he is so popular. You are jumping on the YangGang very late, Yahoo.
#####
Oh, Yang is definitely catching on!!!
#####
Why don‚Äôt you bring him in again rather than upload an old video?
#####
Yahoo should interview him again before they completely ignore him during 2019
#####
It cuts off at 64? FOH!
#####
Yahoo Finance has been biased against Yang, and hiding their dislike ratios on their videos by removing the old ones and re-uploading them over and over.
Disgusting how people can just go along with it, makes it easy to imagine how normal citizens in Germany went along with Hitler.
#####

I can't wait until slimy CNN is replaced with some decent news network. Props to Yang.

You know what you did

Andrew Yang
#####
Yang will be controlled by the globalists just like all the other candidates.
#####
CNN is laughable supporting Bloomberg. They hate Trump so much, but they‚Äôd support another billionaire as long as he has the same ideas they do, which happen to be very anti-American. And WB is asking  one of the two decent candidates the Democratic Party has to offer his opinion on the deep state democrat version of Trump. Democrats don‚Äôt like Yang because he‚Äôs a straight, non-female minority. Imagine that. He should have told Wolf to suck old Buck.
#####
These guys have no room to give advice. Win your campaign first.
#####
Yang!!!!
#####
TRUMP 2020 ha!!!!
#####
Maybe CNN IS FAKE NEWS....they didn‚Äôt even put the yangs name in the title? Wtf? Not one question for his policies?
#####
Andrew Yang sounds like Kermit, but he's no muppet.
Plain, no nonsense speak and a real grasp of the future challenges.
#####
When Yang becomes president I hope he puts CNN out of business
#####
Bloomberg has a whole year to campaign.  Love Yang and Bernie but Bloomberg makes a point that I CAN NOT IGNORE.
#####
Fuck Bloomberg he‚Äôs a modern day Hitler
#####
Thats right , we will be there . yang gang wont be disqualified . we will be there jan , feb and so on ...
#####
Mike Bloomberg is a Moron! He is not for the American interest! He sounds like Hitler when he talks by taking guns away from law abiding citizens. IF IT WASN'T FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT DO CARRY, MORE PEOPLE WOULD OF BEEN KILLED IN THAT TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTING! TAKEN GUNS AWAY FROM LAW ABIDING CITIZENS YOU ARE JUST PUTTING MORE WEAPONS IN CRIMINALS HANDS!  Mike should not speak for my safety and how to protect my family! Once again Mike Bloomberg is an idiot and dangerous to the Constitution! Mike Bloomberg make Crazy Bernie Sanders look like a Saint! America be smart! Don't vote for Mike Bloomberg, he is more corrupt then our politicians of today!

Yang has no previous record of public service, so he needs to meet voters, just to learn the lay of the land. He's only flying by the seat of his pants. Without bribing voters with UBI, he has nothing.
Bloomberg is a philanthropist, who spends $billions every year fighting diseases and poverty throughout the world. He puts his own money where his mouth is, willing to personally pay $5 million on America's share of the Paris Climate Accord, which he will rejoin. He is already known and respected internationally and has worked within the UN.
The DNC can't drag him down (but he can stop their corruption) and the MSM can't sideline him (he can own them). Since he has worked under both parties, hyper-partisan rhetoric can't touch him. He's soaring above all of that petty nonsense. Above all else, Bloomberg can stop the divisive behavior that is destroying our nation.
Debates? He 'don't need no stinkin' debates. He can present his case anytime he wants, without interruptions nor time limits. Air time? He's got all the airtime he needs. He just says, "Here you go America. This is what I'm going to do for you." His ads are in every American's living room, from now until the election. He doesn't need to waste time spinning his wheels on little town halls and knocking on doors.
Mike's tech savvy. He uses data analysis to guide his decision making, without relying upon ego and presumptions.  He will systematically give Trump the spanking that he deserves, then throw his treacherous mob into prison where they belong. All the bullshit will stop as soon as Bloomberg steps into the Oval Office. Money talks and bullshit walks.üëèüëèüëè
Bloomberg 2020!
#####
He has an albatross around the neck of his Mayoral Administration. The Albatross around the neck of his administration was the political lynchin' of an entire congressional district out of NYC and the evidence is COMING...This is the preview...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dffCDGJ3TII&feature=youtu.be
#####
CNN is only using Andrew Yang to get more publicity for Michael Bloomberg.  They don't even mention his name in the title.  Wonder how much money this piece cost bloomberg.  Andrew Yang cares about people but Bloomberg is just another billionaire looking for more power.
#####
Which Democratic candidate is CNN supporting ?
#####
Post Election 2020 White House: 
Michael Bloomberg: President 
Vice President: (TBD)
Secretary of State: (TBD)
Bernie Sanders: Health and Human Services Secretary
Elizabeth Warren: Education Secretary
Tulsi Gabbard: Defense Secretary
Andrew Wang: Commerce Secretary
Amy Klobuchar: Agriculture Secretary
Pete Buttigieg: Housing and Urban Development Secretary
.

#####
Just what we need another billionaire in office.Didn't he say "We need more Billionaires". Under his administration as mayor of NYC, the average joe could no longer afford to live in NYC. Rents and the cost of living skyrocketed under him.

He's just another DEMOCRAT. His stance is no different then the other DEMOCRATS. Not going after illegals. Sign the dream act into law. Health care for all. Who's going to pay for this. The Democratics cry on what trump spends but this will triple the debt. How many people will become doctors if they don't get paid well lmao just look at Canadian health care.  These people are going to screw this up again. And it the drugs that are driving cost up. Which Obama care was supposed to bring down. Another lie
#####
I wonder how Andrew feels about being considered a white male by  Kamala, Cory, and Al Green.
#####
This is clear tyranny - and Bloomberg has been bribing our senators which is why we see a Democrat Coup attempt now !!!!!
VOTE !!!!    And Remove all Democrat Politicians in 2020.    

A Quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero - Addressing the Roman Senate in the year (43 B.C.)

"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. 
An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. 
But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, 
heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; 
he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, 
he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, 
he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, 
he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear."
#####
After Julian Castro clown as$ qualified for the debate. I just Donate to Yang. I want a positive person of color on the debate stage not a trouble maker that can't have they way.
#####
F*** the dems
#####
My advice to Bloomberg‚Äîdon‚Äôt waste your money. Quit.
#####
Michael Bloomberg for president and Andrew Yang for Vice President-- A winning team.
#####
LOL!   Yang today, Kim Jong Un if elected!
#####
Advice - don‚Äôt run you Trump wanna be
#####
No! Nobody is attached to their health insurance company!!! Your private health insurance company doesn‚Äôt care about you, they care about their bottom line. Everybody wants more affordable and better care. 
Can‚Äôt even consider him after  saying that.
#####
I was going for Pete, but Bloomberg has NO COMPETITION!!! HE MAKES THE OTHERS LOOK LIKE AMATEURS
#####
I don't think it's appropriate that the Democratic Party's soul is surrendered to the highest bidder.  Is it true that Bloomberg has vested interests in companies related to the military-industrial complex?  What companies has Bloomberg invested in?  Isn't there a conflict between such companies' interests and those of the average Democratic Party voter?  Nonplussed with the way things are heading.
#####
Yang has a base. He's got a good message and seems like a gracious person. Hope that he is still in the race once primary is held in my state.
#####
The title makes it sound like a bunch of candidates are going to share their opinion, but the only candidate is Yang. Why isn‚Äôt it titled Andrew Yang‚Äôs take on Bloomberg entering the race?
#####
Bloomberg is more of a threat to Biden, not Trump... üòÇ

I think Andrew yang bought bots after the debate.
#####
Do we really need another New York billionaire for president??  I'm voting for Yang.

Damn Yang is getting the Bernie blackout treatment, his name isn't even in the video.

Love to see Andrew Yang in new interviews! He's so smart and he has so much integrity!

Thumbs down for CNN thumbs up for yang dealing with these fools.

What a joke video
#####
I came here for Andrew Yang! #yangmediablackout
#####
That was lowkey disrespectful to interview Andrew Yang with the assumption that he wouldn't make it to the primary. Smh
#####
CNN is such a disgrace! #yanggang
#####
I'm voting for Bloomberg cuz fuck the rest of the democrats.
#####
STUPID CNN. Why don‚Äôt you ask Andrew Yang his policies!!!??? Instead, u asked bullshit questions that were related to him.
#####
Why didn‚Äôt CNN ask AY his policies instead of other candidates??? Very annoying.
#####
Bloomberg is smarter than all of them
#####
DNC AND MEDIA IS SO CORRUPT THEY RIGG THE POLLS. I GO TO JOE BIDEN PAGE AND ALL I SEE IN THE COMMENT SECTION IS EVERYONE CALLING HIM A PHEDOPHILE AND HE'S AHEAD IN THE POLLS? THE FXCK? THEY RIGG THE POLLS. THEY DON'T GIVE ANYONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY LIFT PEOPLE UP FROM POVERTY AND MAKE EVERYONES LIVES BETTER LIKE ANDREW YANG HAVE A CHANCE. THEY WANNA KEEP EVERYONE SLAVES AND COWS THAT THEY CAN MILK. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY TRUMP WON BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN SEE HOW CORRUPT THE MEDIA IS AND THE DNC. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG AND IT'S TRUE. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. IF YANG DON'T WIN THE NOMINEE, I'M VOTING FOR TRUMP AND ALL #YANGGANG SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP ALSO.  DNC AND MEDIA IS SO CORRUPT. THAT'S WHY EVERYONE HATES DEMOCRATS BECUASE OF THIS SHXT. THEIR CORRUPT WAYS.
#####
Need a good formulated truthful answer on hard questions ask Andrew Yang. Vote Yang 2020

This has been the most disrespectful interview to Andrew Yang yet. CNN, a big fuck you to you.

NJ for Yang!

Yang's advice to Bloomberg......."Don't Cry on stage".




And this idiot Bloomburg thinks that he can buy his way into the White House then disarm and enslave America.    I think NOT.  And the Hathaliar Pocahontas also has a ice-cubes chance in hell.
US Citizens are being disarmed by a Cabal bribed mostly Democrat Greedy Feeble-Minded pack of idiots ! And these Democrats will do anything to get those bribes....even force a bad law called THE GUN FREE SCHOOL ZONES ACT which lures psychos into our children's schools resulting in more than 70 dead schoolchildren and teachers beginning with Sandy Hook.


VOTE !!!!    And Remove all Democrat Politicians in 2020.    



A Quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero - Addressing the Roman Senate in the year (43 B.C.)



"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. 

An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. 

But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, 

heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; 

he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, 

he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, 

he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, 

he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear."
#####
CNN is a hypocrite media broadcast. Thank goodness we now have YouTube where we can find truth ourselves. Let CNN be obsolete, just like the other big names killed by internet!

Yangs pragmatist talking points very dangerous against Trump's agenda BERNIE/YANG 2020 üá∫üá∏

Now polling 7%.  And have you seen the crowds in his bus tour.  For snowy, Iowa he draws about 5% of the population to his talks.
#####
These old has-been wind bags. Really?
#####
yang will never make president . people are too stupid to understand what yang is talking about .
#####
Thank you, Whoopi and Meghan. Yang now 4% nationally in latest Emerson poll! YANG GANG!!!

I'm all UP for andrew yang, but I'm FALLING deeply for meghan mccain üòÑ

#yangmediashoutout The new generations are coming out. The best representation of America to the world... #yanggang
#####
Ever since I joined the Yang Gang and Andrew a year ago for this global movement (I am from Germany), I got out of depression, felt love for my fellow human beings again and gained hope that this world can be a beautiful place. The Yang Gang makes me want to be a better human being. Don't screw this up America.
#####
So sad Sonny. Yang is kind of a thing. A very big deal. The future. Maybe your friend Harris could stay in touch and be down. Feel better love. Hate in your h EA's art consumes you too.
#####
Thank you Meghan.
#####
Love that Whoopi, Abby, and Meagan all support Yang and refuse to dismiss him.  Just wish Meagan would stop putting it out there that he'd make a great VP, when he'd be a far better president and more effective as such.
#####
I am very disappointed Sunny......
#####
He is a thing? The only reason he's popping while being blacked out by the media. People's voice must not be loud enough
#####
Go yang
#####
I would like $1000 a month please.  It will definitely help a lot for a mother of 2 young babies.
#####
White lady telling Whoopi that Yang doesn't have black support? 

He has Whoopi, Donald Glover, and Dave Chapelle.
#####
Everyone get involved today. You surely have 10 minutes a day to get YANG elected. A daily 10 minute quest is waiting for you at yangdaily10.com
#####
Yang 10% 3rd place!
#####
I‚Äôm 42 and it all about Andrew Yang.. #yang2020 ...
#####
they exported this show platform to the UK too , its called loose women, Its sexist toward men !
#####
I appreciate Whoppi‚Äôs take on Yang....and I disagree with her A LOT!
#####
His dad grew up in China? He is Taiwanese.........this might need a fact check.
#####
This was nice.
#####
Best thing Meghan ever said !!
#####
Andrew Yang shouldn‚Äôt have come to this show he was just something to be laughed by this witches in view. As Chinese Asian American these guys in view know that it will still take decades for a Chinese Asian Americans to be elected President. Yang should start and run for mayor or Governor of his state and see how it works out,which this could be also quite difficult.
#####
I'm 64. Andrew Yang has my vote. Polls aren't worth spit. Votes are counted.
#####
Joy Behar, 
     The media blackout of ANDREW YANG hasn't been reporting objectively, autonomously, and independently. The incumbents numbers all around, capital raised, number of contributing supporter's, at this stage of the campaign in 2015, are way below ANDREW YANGS now.
Here are some numbers and data
The incumbent has forced big businesses like Amazon to channel income streams through Ireland financial systems and paying 0 taxes here. Pass ANDREW YANGS freedom dividend to remind Jeff Bezos he is still an American or vote for the incumbent and make Ireland greater
100 of the fortune 500 companies are paying 0 taxes here. You have to be pretty stupid to let them get away with it
We're currently in 7 wars yesterday we sent 14 thousand Marines and 60 aircraft carriers to Iran essentially surrounding them our military is over extended. Bring our troops and capital home and put an end to these neverending wars meanwhile China's military is planting billions not millions of trees every year
First president Ronald Reagans NAFTA messed up everything
We blasted away millions of manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio Indiana Wisconsin Pennsylvania. Automation relentlessly replacing attorneys retail clerks cashier's factory workers janitors dentists, fast food workers, driverless Uber fleets truckers.
Walmart for example driverless18 wheelers deliver the merchandise robotics unload it and stock the shelves and clean the floors then robots help you check out your self. There's no jobs
Homelessness, joblessness depression rates, suiside rates are at an all time high
Life expectancy is at its lowest since the Spanish flue epidemic of 1912. 
Opioid overdoses and suiside deaths have surpassed vehicle accident related deaths
Law enforcement runs whole families out of town where they won't be seen the media blackout insures they're not covered by the news. These people want to work there's no jobs
Woman know when they are being lied to get your boot off of our throats and put the money in our hands.
You have been f_____, ANDREW YANG will un f___ you
#####
Woman in my late twenties, yet to be polled, voting for Andrew Yang. :)
#####
I like Whoopy in this segment
#####
My husbands black and loves Yang! I do too!
#####
https://youtu.be/RrF7qdFP2Qc uh oh Yang Gang.
#####
Their are many boomers supporting Yang. Whoopi is right, he is a thing. You all need to go to YouTube and search Andrew Yang and you will see tons of followers, interviews, rallies. Thank you Megan and Whoopi.
#####
I'll be voting for the first time and I am voting for Andrew Yang.
#####
‚ù§
#####
Meghan McCain knows all about McDonald's
#####
If Yang can unite Meghan and Whoopi, he can unite the country.
#####
I am 15 and i support Yang
#####
Support  a smart person to be president.  

Yang2020!!!!
#####
Why are you guys saying that he's 'not a thing'. In this clip without pitching the ideas they run for you making into a popularity contest. :(
#####
I‚Äôm yang gang even tho I‚Äôm republican
#####
28 year old woman, and Yang is my top pick.
#####
LOL, Whoopi hit a sensitive subject there when she started to change the framing around the YangBlackout by attributing it to his skin color rather than his anti-establishment persona. It‚Äôs probably because she doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs a thing for the establishment to block outsiders, but it‚Äôs still a very useful way to frame the subject so that the YangBlackout‚Äôs mission of fair representation can suddenly be adopted by the common people. 

Again, the common person, like Whoopi, doesn‚Äôt understand establishment vs. anti-establishment dynamics, so using this as a reason for the YangBlackout (while more truthful), won‚Äôt have as big of an impact. However, if the national discourse becomes about the establishment ignoring Yang because of his skin color, suddenly you can get a CRAP TON more support for the cause.

If we can get this line of attack moving, it could be huge in pressuring the establishment to treat Yang fairly. Imagine if Childish Gambino/Donald Glover said on-record that the media is racist because of the way they‚Äôre treating Yang? LOL üòÇ 

*INSTANT COVERAGE GUARANTEED*

WE have to do this, if Yang does it, he‚Äôd be accused of playing the race card (although it would generate more press and Trump might have proved that‚Äôs all that matters).
#####
His dad is from Taiwan, not China.... thanks for spitting incorrect facts. Thanks for rounding all Asians as a Chinese.
#####
Boomer here for Yang 2020!! 62 years young!! Go Andrew!! I've got Yang Gear, wear it every where I go! Four bumper stickers, two in front two in the back! Two yard signs and I'm going to get two more for the doors on my car, left and right and¬†moving forward! Donated $100 so far and will donate $100/month every month until he wins!! I Yang to everyone I see and meet whether I know them or not!! Get out there everybody and talk Andrew Up!! Don't be embarrassed!! Speak up, stand up for your literal lives, because if we don't help this man into the White House we are doomed, and if you don't support Andrew and he doesn't win, it will be on your hands!! Get up, stand up, speak up, donate to Andrew and invest in your own future!!
#####
Joy is such an ignorant dumb somewhat celebrity, why does anyone care about her useless opinions? Closed off tired old ladies, please just go home to your shiatsu dogs and stay there!
#####
My jaw is in the floor over Megan‚Äôs commentary!!! Sticking up for Yang! Solid analysis!  VOICE OF REASON, EVEN. 

Am I in a dream?? THANK YOU.
#####
All the comments I see says they support yang. If you did a poll that included all of the American people instead of a random few you would see that yang would be the front runner.  Cant trust these polls because polls dont include the entirety of the American people .
#####
Andrew Yang is definitely a thing now!
#####
When megan sounds more reasonable than all the wamen!
#####
Vote Yang
#####
Thank you megan for sticking up for AY
#####
Im black and im proud, and my vote is Andrew Yang and ill say it outloud
#####
Yang lied about Medicare For All!
#####
Libertarian Republican Gen X.  If he makes it here I will vote for him.  Someone please close Joy' s casket.  The walking dead of ideas needs to go away.
#####
Black man. 30yrs old. I'm voting for Yang.
#####
Megan McCain backing this democrat is indication enough. Lesssgoo #YangGang
#####
The bookend of The View table really supports Yang.  The middle old lady, not so much.
#####
Woopie! Show them the purple weed!
#####
i live in a young, liberal pocket of NH and everyone I've talked to is either voting for Yang or is strongly considering him. no one I've spoken to is voting for Biden and I've never even heard Amy K's name mentioned in conversation. no one has called us (or anyone we know) to participate in a poll.
#####
We‚Äôre not trying to ‚Äúmake ANDREW Yang a thing‚Äù! He IS a thing. It‚Äôs media minds like yours that CHOOSE to plug their ears and ignore Andrew. #AndrewYang2020 Never thought I‚Äôd agree w/ Megan on anything, but yes, the media never gives ANDREW the recognition nor media time that they give to others. THIS BLACK WOMAN IS VOTING FOR YANG NOT AS A VP PICK, BUTAS PRESIDENT! People like this woman like to ignore Yang b/c he comes at you with MATH and they don‚Äôt like it b/c they don‚Äôt want to have to use deductive reasoning and logical and rational thought processes.
#####
Can‚Äôt wait to call Mr. Yang the president of the USA!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
#####
Yang fail to answer for how long is the $1K a month dividend. It feels he is buying my vote.
#####
Im black and in my 30s she right media black out for yang. Hes still here. He has my vote. Hes smart very smart
#####
Andrew Yang is so nice to listen to and if the media would give him more time I think he would blast off.
#####
I hope you eat your words, Sunny.
#####
Taiwan is not China....but then again, to these gwai lo, asians all chinese lol
#####
MORE YANG PLEASE
#####
I'm from Canada so I can't vote for Yang.  So please black and Hispanic voters.  You guys need to get Yang to represent Democrats against Trump.  This world needs a visionary leader who understands that humanity should come first before corporate profits.  Unity is the way to move ahead in the 21sr century. Divisiveness and fear will not go very far.  So please vote for Yang.
#####
If you support Yang get out there and VOTE. Im 20 and im lazy. All I care about is memes not politics. But you, like me have the power to change this election so just do it. Nike
#####
Yang is the only one out there spittin' facts. All the rest of 'em are just making promises they will never keep. Look at Trump, he just made a bunch of promises and hasn't really acted on them.
#####
gotta love people that put more effort into dismissing the possibility of something happening than discussing the ideas themselves. so vapid
#####
Ying Yang that's a winner. Reach for the Stars with that.
#####
We all hope Nancy breaks her neck down the stairs wear her hooker high heels.
#####
Yaaaaaas
#####
Whoopi is yanggang and you're trying to tell me he can't get the black vote? Keep talking
#####
VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO
#####
I'm 66 and, after listening to Andrew Yang for the last 3 months on stage and U-tube, I'm going to vote for him!   He's amazing!   And..... I voted for TRUMP in 2016!  He's smart.... he is knowledgeable... he has humor and he is forward thinking!   What more could Democrats want???? I'm a Republican and I will be VOTING for YANG!!!
#####
Wow I like u ladys nice talk abt Andrew yang part of yanggang love u

Hey lady, not our fault his name rhymes with gang. And apparently you hate that. It‚Äôs not a trend and we‚Äôre not going anywhere #yang2020
#####
YANG 2020
#####
Love whoopi. She keeps it real. üòò
#####
His parents are from Taiwan, not mainland China, Taiwan is Republic of China while mainland China is People‚Äôs Republic of China
#####
Don‚Äôt forget that his mother and father were incredibly smart and hard working. I believe his father holds a ton of patents and inventions during his time at IBM.
#####
wait wait wait....whats that blonde girls name?? doesn't matter but i recall a time when she heavily dismissed Yang... and man its crazy to see her talk about him now in such a positive view lol. a few months ago she couldnt stop attacking the freedom dividend and everything he was talking about ...now look at this 180 spin... its awesome... people are understanding the message and realizing what hes trying to do for us
#####
Automation is important in few places but not necessary in many others. We need people who understand these future technologies to use them wisely and someone out there who thinks  visionary. As we all know still American politics affect whole world .People all around the world need guy like Yang to be president. He is our only hope to make world a better place because he got nothing to loose , while all others have their career to loose.
#####
DNC hates Yang so they'll keep trying discredit him or leave him off polls.
#####
Have you ever bought a computer??? It gets old instantly. Automation makes everything old.... Gawd. Horrible huh. Lol Andrew Yang 2020
#####
His dad is from Taiwan not China
#####
ANDREW YANG 2020. I worked for Bernie and now am volunteering for Yang
#####
TAIWAN!!!!!!!!

If you give an 18 year old 1000$ a month they will probably figure they never need to get a job.   This is a foolish idea.

I hope

PEPOPEEPOEPO
POOEPPOEPEE
#####
So who is going to create a Facebook event to get everyone to raid the poll booths to get Yang in office??
#####
God Bless Andrew Yang and his family no matter what the outcome.......that's first time I've ever felt this way about an almost politician!!!  I will follow Andrew's career from now onwards..........
#####
I hate this show. I only clicked because of aYang
#####
He's not even running, dems are losing again. until they stop their socialism bullshit and wasting our money on a bs impeachment(because senate won't move it forward anyway so it's honestly a waste) they won't win, which is sad
#####
some points i agree with but 3 t is not possible
#####
his laugh is fake
#####
In terms of shocking, it's not. Its called benefit and risk, that's it 1:09:20
#####
Looks so much like me, but man does he sound so white I'm just sayin lmao
#####
1,000 Bucks a month extra could really help change my life and many others for the better but lets see here. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are 247,813,910 adults living in the United States. 247,813,910 x 1,000 x 12= $2,973,766,920,000 per year. Where is that money going to come from? Since 1k a month is one of his most popular campaign promises, you'd think you guys would've taken a short break from licking his asshole to get a better insight into this policy. Although most Americans truly are sick of old politicians and their old ways, we're especially sick of the age old practice of making false promises in order to attract votes. Trump has done many things he promised he would do other than the most important thing he was elected for. Draining the SWAMP!! Nothing Yang or anyone else promises will be worth it until we as a people are able to hold our govt. officials accountable for their misdeeds.
#####
So many midrolls now lol
#####
I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter, but everything this guy says is right, and he‚Äôs my second choice
#####
Trump gets four more years at least thank you üôè üíï
#####
Trump re-election is inevitable üòÇ Nice try though guys üò¢
#####
‚ÄúComing up here today YANG¬† has no hidden agenda. he is¬† fighting for your future. Losing your¬† future is not like losing an election,
#####
I like that pizza pie I like that pizza pizza
#####
The god damn add revenue from the 16  commericals in this video better go straight to Yang
#####
Boooorrringgg
#####
I really wish Pete Buttigieg would also do more podcast interviews.
#####
I prefer bernie, but I still like yang.
#####
Extremely small chance he will actually win, but hope he does
#####
I onestlly think trump going two win again there's just two many accidents for the democratic side
#####
There are over 7 million in the United States that are millionaires, what would giving them a $1,000 a month do? Dumbest idea in political history
#####
What is he laughing at?
#####
This guy has ideas that wouldn‚Äôt work
#####
I like you guys (you are genuinely funny), but i dont like your political side. Still gonna watch tho
#####
I hope you get elected you would make a great president. Keep up the good work!
#####
Yangbang

This. This is good
#####
Holy crap he is 45?? I thought he was 30 lmao
#####
how did i miss this?
#####
$15k is the official poverty level of the US, not sure how bribing people with $12k a year is seen any less than placating to poor people with someone else's money, as much as it is insolvent and laughed at on the main stage. The US is already 23 trillion in debt, but handing out cash is going to solve the poverty problem with no unintended consequences.
#####
you guys are kinda clueless about politics, bill maher? really?
#####
WE NEED ANDREW YANG ‚úäüèº‚úäüèº
#####
Nice dodge on the religious question lol
#####
I'm sold
#####
YANG GANg
#####
Yang is a systems thinker. A goal centered approach defined by meaningful metrics! Got my vote
#####
I just learned who he is less than a week ago. Now I'm registered as a Democrat just so I can vote in the primaries. I'm not far from donating to his campaign too.
#####
Im from europe and i wanna be a member of the yang gang.
#####
kinda didn't think out the whole drug cartel angle... 'lets make it legal to posses', 'but cartels are still gonna sell it and make money off it and the street level sellers are still gonna go to jail', 'uh uh yea'... better to just make it all legal and sold like liquor in an approved facility and you have to give pamphlets to resources when selling and use the tax revenue to bolster programs in the communities impacted (create jobs). similar to cigs - run anti ads, teach kids it sucks and tax the hell out of it.
#####
I would vote yang if only he wasn't hispanic :/
#####
US is the greatest place to live! Yang2020!
#####
Don't swear BTS, In good words
#####
F-ing Retar/d arrived on a Wheelchair. What a dush !

the guy actually has answers

Never voting for this commie
#####
Ethan's response to Yang saying he is gonna legalize some drugs is funny haha he said yes so fast
#####
americans please let this guy become president
#####
YAY!  Yang2020
#####
In 2013 I came down with mononucleosis at the end of my sophomore semester, and Tylenol wasn‚Äôt keeping the fever down so I went to the university health center thinking I would get a different set of antibiotics (or whatever they had originally prescribed me) but no, they talked to me for a min then wrote me a script for OxyContin!! At the core of the addiction plague is reckless doctors getting people started on this stuff for no good reason.
#####
The minimum was just below 2 an hour dollars the average home cost like 23 thousand dollars in 1970. The minimum pay today is about 7.50. The average home cost about 150,000 dollars things have not changed that much. It‚Äôs just inflation
#####
I'm voting Trump, but I like Andrew Yang. I think itd be cool if he could join the administration
#####
love that yang is on the podcast, most politicians wouldn't give you the time of day like this.
#####
14:45 - That's the same observation a Trump supporter made during a Q&Q in Iowa a few days ago. Andrew sees the common thread and is able to pull it all together. It's how his mind works. Likely that individual has moved from Yangcurious to Yang Gang :)
#####
IMPORTANT: If you want to vote Yang in 2020, you NEED to vote for him in the democratic primaries. That's the only way he's going to get on the ticket. 



In some states that even means registering as a democrat in order to participate. If you don't identify as dem, hopefully you'll be ok with it since it's a means to an end and you can always change later. Look up the rules in your state so you don't miss any deadlines! Also make sure that you're registered to vote!!



Please LIKE this comment to make sure the message gets delivered :))

Watching this show for the first time and really love itüëçüèª

Everybody vote for this guy Now!!!

If I could I would definitely vote for him

You guys are idiots voting for people who are only trying to take our rights away. Taking our guns away and all our rights that we have as people, and yet some people have the nerve to try to tell me that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. If you read too much into the fake news online then you don‚Äôt know a thing that‚Äôs going on. But if you are intelligent and know you‚Äôre rights and how the system works then you would see through all this shit for what it is. We are only coming closer to a civil war cause of this shit with them trying to take our right to bear arms away from us so just be ready people. And don‚Äôt @ me I‚Äôm not here to be argued with by idiots who won‚Äôt understand reality.
#####
jagmeet vibes
#####
Make videos again maybe with pewdiepie or something
#####
Is H3 OK???
#####
as great as yang sounds and how nice he seems, theres still a sort of phoniness to the way he talks and holds himself. it shows that no matter what kind of person you are, politics will change you. I understand that he seems a lot more human than other politicians, but he has an agenda like every other politician. I dont like how people are putting him on a pedestal and making him seem like he is a wonderful person. he is running for president- and I'm sure he had to step on a few toes to get to where he is.
#####
H3 is still going?
#####
When does the Pod come back dad?
#####
Podcast today !!
#####
I bet the new channel banner is the waveform for the 'Wheres the pizza' soundbyte.

Ok I need your podcast to sleep. I'm glad you got a good holiday in!! But I'm selfish and need the podcasts to come back ASAP! miss u guys :'(

Hey Ethan, ima be honest. New logo looks like it was made in paint

Well he just presented ideas that sounds good but doesn't work. Listen people, UBI cost 3 trillion a year. Do you know that as of Dec 2018 US government debt is 21 trillion . If they government can collect taxes through VAT and spend less on other welfare programs as Andrew suggested they would have done this ages ago to improve their budget. And there were no government shut down due to budget dispute in the past years.  How the 3 trillion UBI will pass Congress ?  

Common people . Please think critically. Either Andrew genuinely  doesn't know that or he knew but still promised his voters these impractical things to win votes. Gods know wat he really thinks.

I've said this a thousand times, but I'm gonna say it again.  It's smart as hell how Yang was playing political chess this whole time, laying back while other candidates weakened each other and fell outta the way, andd Yang kept rising slowly in the background.  But now he's top 5 and only the front-runners are left.  IT'S TIME TO UPSHIFT.

Yang, you gotta come out swinging in the next debate.  Dominate the conversation with substance, force the debate you want to have, challenge the front-runners on their data.  Show why their ideas aren't effective enough and why your platforms are superior.  Grab the spotlight, grab the speaking time, grab the mic.


YOU NEED TO PICK A FIGHT.  Not a personal one necessarily, but definitely a policy one.  You have to CONTRAST yourself and show why you are the One.  There's not much time left to break into the top-tier.  If you don't cause a stir that has the MSM talking heads focused on you one way or another after this debate, I don't know how many opportunities there will be left.  IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

Yang has a laugh that reveals he enjoys his own talk too much. I had to turn him off.
#####
His response to the rent critique is incredibly lacking. Take somewhere like Seattle or San Francisco where a lot of people moved in and started making a ton of cash. There are full-scale housing crises there now, and rent has gone through the ceiling. The fact of the matter is that landlords set rent at "market prices", which will always increase as people get more money.


Yang is very likeable, I just wish he'd take that meaningful step to the left and advocate a material change to the system.
#####
He's a likeable guy. Shame about his policies -- what is a universal income without serious rent control in tandem? Or better yet, public housing. But I guess this is the US we're talking about.
#####
Yang is the only candidate i've ever donated to the campaign and actually interested in voting for genuinely.
#####
Has anyone sat down with a calculator and ran the MATH on the $1,000 per month for every US citizen over 18 and looked at those numbers?  Just curious if you guys are really doing math these days.
#####
Here's why Andrew Yang is not the best candidate. The problems with Yang's UBI are many, and it does little to solve the huge problem of inequality in society. More importantly, Medicare for All (which Yang does _not_ support), the Fight for $15, and the Green New Deal, are a lot more necessary and go far further to solve problems for the poor & working (low & middle income) people of USA.
#####
I've gotta say - the fact that Jamie Dimon roughly agrees with your plan for dealing with poverty should give you pause. The guy is a fully entrenched in the oligarchy and runs a hugely profitable bank that leaves its working class employees living in penury. 
My fear is that, whether Yang sees this or not, UBI is just a way to preserve and entrench the existing power structures, including the corporate control of government, while keeping the peasants from the gates with a short term pay-off.
The root cause of the country's problems isn't inequality. That is a symptom. The root cause is that the country is bordering on being an oligarchy with a deeply corrupt political system that serves the rich and corporations. UBI won't fix that. In fact it will draw energy away from fixing that.

And the problem with that is that nothing else that is so broken, from climate change to healthcare, will get fixed until the rot at the heart of politics is stopped and reversed.

Only one candidate has a cleared eyed strategy for doing that.
#####
Yang's assertion that the US lost 4 million manufacturing jobs due to automation is seductive, but it's highly contested.
https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/16/both-trade-and-automation-hurt-and-helped-jobs-whi/
Here are three possible causes of manufacturing job losses
1 massive and rapid automation
2 economic conditions leading to collapse in demand
3 corporations taking advantage of cheap wages overseas and increasingly few barriers to using it (China, Mexico, etc) 

Given that 3 is the easiest to happen and we know that the relevant trading conditions are in place, and that it would suit the corporations that generally drive government policy (being easiest and cheapest for them), I think it would be unwise to bet against this being the actual main reason for job losses.

Therefore, with the wrong diagnosis, Yang has hit on the wrong cure.
#####
Andrew is simply the best candidate!  #yang2020!!
#####
I'm sorry. I like Yang in some ways but he lies about Medicare for all in his ads.   He isn't for a public option. He thinks it should be phased in but claims Medicare for all is his platform in his new ad. It's not at all. Bernie is the only good choice with a proven record that can't be debunked. Bernie has a very feasible way to pay for his plans. I like what Yang says about tech, but I'm sick of politicians who lie to get elected then backtrack.

I have chickens and they are almost as smart as my dogs.  They answer when I call and all have different personalities. They feel empathy for each other and guard weaker members of the flock. They recognize and remember (even after long separations) hundreds of different humans and animals. They remember traumatic experiences and avoid the places where they happened.  People want to believe chickens, cows, and pigs are stupid so they don't feel guilty about not caring.  If an animal has a brain, it can suffer.  Some people eat dogs, I'm sure they justify it the same way.  The hard truth is that if you don't pay attention to what you consume, you are complicit in more suffering than you think.

Also, good interview!

Beto and Bennett attending a Goldman "small business forum" after being out of the race is suspect, squared.

The fact is that there is a difference between person and object and that's sentiency. Persons have the capacity for consciousness and objects do not and persons have rights and objects have no capacity for them. Therefore, the GOP has no authority to enact laws that infringe on the rights of women in their quest to elevate the status of an object, the fertilized egg, to the status of person. Every god damned anti-abortion law is unconstitutional and should be struck down by every god damned court. The GOP is a far bigger problem than the Democrats, there is no equivalence between the two parties.


Also, Andrew should consider increasing the upper marginal tax rates to 90% again. When they are high, upper earners paid their employees more and invested in the business. When upper margins are low, the wealthy simply take more of the economy for themselves.
#####
I'm a Bernie guy.  The more I hear yang the more I love him.  We need Andrew yang to be part of the dialogue and movement to actually deal with the issues we face.  Thanks Andrew for being one of the few people talking about what's really going on.  Like I said,  I'm a Bernie guy but I'm open minded and I'm all for more Andrew yang and people like him.

You had me at circumcision ...or...er...lack of circumcision. I mean I‚Äôm still for Bernie, but I wanted to say that
#####
I don't know if I'm exactly correct on everything I'm saying but I researched a little and this is my opinion. 

His policies sound good but you have to be even more weary about anything sounding good. What I came to understand is that if Andrew Yang becomes the President of America, he will be the leader through the gateway to a social credit system. 

Andrew wants "Human Centered Capitalism". It's basically Socialism and Socialism doesn't work well with money. At first he says something I agree with. Humans are important than money, which is absolutely right. But then:

"The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar"
 "We need to make the markets serve us rather than the other way around"
"We need government leaders who are truly laser-focused on the public interest above all else and will lead companies to act accordingly"

The upside to his campaign kind of sounds like he wants to get more people more leverage when it comes to jobs. One of the concerns is paying everyone equally. To pay everyone equally, everyone will need to get less money. That really doesn't pan out too well with prices of our necessities increasing every year. Especially when regulators will also be more strict when it comes to a corporations excess profit.
¬† 
¬†¬† What is weird is how he refers to the corporations as if they are horses and regulators having to rein their excesses in. Then says "The government should create a modern timebanking system that will reward people and organizations who drive significant social value". Here I'm guessing the government is the owner of all the ranches. This is good for people who have the same values. However, I don't think that everyone really does. 

¬† "Regulators need to be focused on making the right decisions and policies for the public with zero concern for their next position". That sounds like many corporations can face dramatic changes. Excess money can be used to reinvest into corporations immediately. But with this being a socialist method, the market needs to serve the people. As a result, this can just hurt the corporations. Regulators would need to be at the top of their game all the time. Additionally, they will be blocked out of an opportunity within the private sector. Their relationships with private sectors will become stagnant. 

¬† So now we have to ask how we affected by these regulators. With timebanking, they would be required to be more critical of how they regulate buisness and¬† determining the value of a Time Credit. They would have to make it fair while evaluating the skill set and social value of each person. People getting paid accordingly will be very rough. I assume Time credits won't fully replace curremcy. If this is to become popular people should keep this in mind: will there be FREE classes to ensure that we all have the skills to acquire time credits? On one hand, there won't be any because that takes time. People need to get paid to instruct, vast resources need to be acquired for the facilities usage and space will either need to be rented or constructed. Now let's say the government creates a loophole(cause they're the government), goes with this idea and pays out whatever amount of money to get this done. This has potential because job openings will increase through timebanking. However, there is still a drawback here. If they did that, I'm sure the government would tax us significantly to recoup losses and inevitably create a time credit monopoly. You have to account for a person's ingenuity, transportation, possible relocation for living quarters, etc. Even if people become like minded to make living easier, where would the money come from to support the people if timebanking becomes more prevalent or possibly our stable? 

¬† Andrew's campaign is meant to help out everyone do more than just get by. If people are expected to work multiple positions and are rewarded by meeting social expectations, they will be under pressure. Not only that, but what exactly will be acceptable in terms of social value? If you want to say that humans are more important than money, then you have to keep morale going. If morale is inconsistent, you will definitely have unhappy people. Which can cause inefficiency and lead to termination or people quitting their jobs. Here is where we see the downside of maximizing well being meeting the demand of it's controllers. 

¬† Andrew also believes in the advancement of technology and it's uses. With AI, we can have a system that allows us to see how reliable a person is before trading hours with them. Similar to how the Social Credit System is in China. But with technology advancing, it can easily put people out of jobs. With a "wearable device that monitors your vital signs"¬† that also starts "recommending occasional behavior changes", the world probably wouldn't even need as many doctor's. Which would be unfortunate for those who spent money and put in effort for a medical degree. But this may be untrue and I can possibly be proven wrong.

¬† Speaking of doctors, Andrew says he wants to reform the state of our health care system. He acknowledge's the amount of people who don't have healthcare, the difficulty paying off expenses, the job lock that people face to keep their health care plan and doctors not being able to properly help people. Now with more people being expected to trade hours doing work for credit, you will risk more people getting sick. This results in more doctors being needed; especially if we consider doctors needing to spend more time to give proper care and more people obtaining health a care plan. Better tests, technology and medicine means more resources and more money. So whether there be more or less doctors, they will continue to struggle with proper compensation. Thus, people will continue to struggle with healthcare and may face debt because of it.

¬† Lastly, let's talk about one of Andrew's strongest points: the Guaranteed Income.¬†Yang quotes many people who support this type of thinking. Initially, I did think it was a good idea and many others did as well. He wants to give every American $1,000/mo so they can add flexibility to their living situation. Things may be good for his first year or so but it'll be rough after that. The reason I say that is because it sounds like he somewhat believes in the Free Market Policy. To my understanding, the Free Market Policy allows financial freedom to obtain innovation within a country. However, a country has to cut corners in order to fulfill its objectives. This is the same policy Donald Trump follows during his presidency. With the pressure of more responsibility for the regulators, it will be impossible to advance using that policy without consequences. Enabling welfare throughout the country, starting the use of time banking and tax increases mean living will become more expensive. Resulting in people becoming dependent on welfare and struggling for time credit throughout his term as president. It will become likely that also America will face an economic crash due to it's large demand for resources and it's inability to pay off debt. Effectively making it a third world country.
¬† 
¬† That concludes my take on his policies. I may be wrong about some things but we'll have to see.

Can you IMAGINE the possibilities and how well people in the US could be doing now if we just had the OPPORTUNITY to have the internet at speeds faster than old time original dial up.  ATT and other providers are robbing the consumers blind providing at $50-85. A month for a service only equal to just above dial up.  Our government has paid for internet all over the world including, iraq, Afghanistan, even literally the Antarctic and YET IN RURAL AMERICA, people cannot even get 3G UNLESS you go with a good old co-op that costs more than other services, and as soon as you step outside the area, you can‚Äôt make, receive calls, texts, you have no access to data.  It‚Äôs PATHETIC AND YET companies like AT&T are allowed to continue to rape the consumer and provide no service with NO oversight while receiving lots and lots of subsidies and government welfare that American citizens paying taxes cannot have.  When is anyone going to address how far behind we are.  Trump ran his campaign on how horrible our infrastructure was.  To quote ‚Äúit‚Äôs like a 3rd world country‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo one will want to visit our airports....‚Äù which was all true.  What has he done?  Not one damn thing except give all the money to the wealthiest companies who in turn have made no upgrades, no assistance to the citizens whatsoever.   Yang, Tulsi (who has been completely ostracized) are our best and brightest and NO media will give them the time of day.  Too much money getting laundered to the criminal establishment

I urge anyone: google the VENUS PROJECT. It eliminates a monetary system and puts in its place a RESOURCE-BASED system. It's NOT a utopia, but if used, it can eliminate poverty, scarcity, war, and other global problems & issues. Jacques Fresco worked for almost 70 years on this (Venus Project). Automation doesn't HAVE to displace people if these ideas were put into action. It's called the VENUS PROJECT because it was developed in Venus, Florida (nothing to do with the planet). Please: just take a look. Also related: the ZEITGEIST MOVEMENT.

Yang has a PAC and only offers a public healthcare option. Apart from the UBI, how is he really different than Buttigieg or Biden? A UBI is a great idea, but funding it with a regressive tax is not. I find problems not only in specific parts of his plan, but the overall approach. He's fearmongering about automation and bribing people with a pittance (freedom dividend). We deserve and can have so much more. #Bernie2020
#####
Katie was especially annoying this episode... as was Yang's laugh.


Overall, Yang seems like a decent fellow, but like Warren, his area of focus is far too narrow for a presidential candidate.  I'm glad he's energizing people -- as Bernie did for me in 2015/6 -- but I hope you newly engaged folks stay engaged if/when he drops out.  Most people only pay attention during presidential election years, and our country's massive problems are a direct result of this disengagement.  Stay engaged, especially at your local level, where your energy and participation will have a greater impact.

#####
Yang has a great laugh. Men who laugh like that, in my experience, are good, honest folk!
#####
You twp make the terrors of daily planetary life SOOO hilarious!!! Placenta curious!! Oh and damn insightful as well.
#####
I'd be onboard if Yang supported m4all. We have to get the profit motive out of health care and stop linking it to our jobs. I don't want my UBI to get sucked up by premiums, deductibles, copays, and prescriptions. I don't want my employer having control over me by keeping me hostage with health insurance.
#####
I'm moderately impressed--a very "real" guy, yes, but no talk of the two biggest issues we face (or are refusing to face): climate chaos, which will likely upset all Yang's great plans, and ending US militarism, which could pay for those plans.
#####
That guy interviewing Corbyn is obviously a radical leftist. Corbyn should have walked out in a huff.
#####
Great interview üëç
#####
YangGang is enthusiastic bc Andrew Yang is enthusiastic!

You might say a lot of news is stillborn these days.

41:42 for Andrew Yang.
#####
Andrew Yang's compensation from his non-profit Venture for America was $213,979 in 2017 (latest year of published tax filings). Or, a *whopping 6.3%* of the organization's total revenue for that year. This, despite the organization recording a deficit of $ -2,651,496 for the year. What CEO of a major corporation pulls in _anywhere_ near such a percentage of revenue as compensation? What CEO would retain their position, let alone receive such an outrageous percentage of revenue as compensation, if the company has an expense deficit nearly equal to the entirety of the revenue? The man is running a non-profit that had $2.6M in total revenue in 2017, while having $3.6M in employee compensation expenses alone. 


I wouldn't hire this guy to run my dish washing machine.
#####
Thank you Lee for all you do!
#####
ubi or lower everyones taxes by 1000-2000
#####
UBI > Wealth Tax.

UBI > $15 Minimum Wage.

UBI > Federal Jobs Guarantee.

UBI > Public College.

UBI > Public Child Care.

UBI > 120+ Social Welfare Programs.
#####
Yang is so refreshing as a candidate. I would love to have a data driven, economically minded, business-experienced pragmatic visionary that doesn‚Äôt spew divisive rhetoric in the White House. ¬†

He understands that UBI properly implemented is one of the most effective, efficient, simple, and fair ways to accomplish many of the economic/inequality goals of society, solve many of our problems, and all in a way that truly benefit everyone.¬†

It would have huge effects on entrepreneurship, poverty, homelessness, prisoner rehabilitation, abused women, sex trade, abortions, unions, upward mobility, charities, marriage, health, mental health, IQ, crime, violence, homicides, suicide, education rates, LGBT community, job lock, dynamism, overall economy, bureaucratic waste, etc. It would help create exactly the type of system that everyone could thrive in.
#####
Hey remember when yang was asked about how rent will inevitably go up after everyone gets their neetbux, he was like "erm i dunno find another landlord". Because rent totally doesn't have a universal tendency to rise, it's just the one landlord *you* have, right?
#####
Andrew Yang is the truth! #Yang2020
#####
UBI in and of itself will be of little value if the cost of housing , healthcare , childcare, education are not contained

Alex looked into the eyes of Andrew Yang and she believes- YangGang all the way!
#####
Came here after watching your new special, wanted to know if you actually know that Andrew Yang is running for president, because i didn't see you mentioning him even once. 

Sad.
#####
This is their most viewed video on YouTube for this election cycle
#####
Is it me or is he extra charming in this video? üòç

https://www.yang2020.com/
Let‚Äôs make it happen, a small donation can get him back on stage in January! We deserve a voice.
#####
YANG GANG
#####
Hey  The Circus on SHOWTIME people, you need to give Yang more screentime. Not for him, do it for your self. YangGang is always there and its rising. You will get a lot of views and good vibes there.
And thanks to all former Trump supporters. I love your open mind for a real change. 

But i need to remind you all that the critical part are the primaries. If not yet happen, consider register blue to make sure this is happening. A lot of Bernie folks seem too comfortable, but i know for sure if Bernie or Joe is running Trump will stay for another 4 years. And no one with any reason wants to let that happen.
#####
Everything is pretty much imported here from China, Yang was born here in NY, parents are from Taiwan, not China. Most American-made candidates are faulty like the one in the Oval office, Yang has my vote.
#####
Next President Andrew Yang not only has a huge brain, hugely important has a big heart also. In recent history all america voters get nothing but empty promises. With Andrew Yang we as voters get for the first time solid dividend from the country.
#####
She's looking at him like.. "ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!?!?!" lool Yang2020!

Longer coverage needed.
#####
Check this video out 
https://youtu.be/kq4wk_ZM7ts
Very good video for Yang
#####
The fact that Yang has got this far on a "shoestring" budget, should demonstrate to people that Yang is extremely efficient and effective. Yang can do more with less. Exactly what people want from a leader in government. People don't want their tax money wasted foolishly and Yang will give the people the best bang for their buck. The government of politicians wastes about 30% of the money, so (efficient) Yang will even reclaim much of that wasted money by doing a little house cleaning once he is President.
Yang is the brilliant visionary leader I always envisioned, but never thought I would see in the US. It's up to the people to see what they have right in front of them. Don't let a once in a life time President slip away. Yang's personality type is very rare. Yang himself is a very healthy version of his personality type and he is exceptionally intelligent for his type, even though his type is called "the Mastermind". My point is that Yang is even more than a once in a life time leader. Lincoln, JFK and MLK jr were all the same rare type as Yang and I think Yang is even smarter than they were. Yang is in the top 0.1 percentile. That is super genius. Yet Yang is still very humble. Yang is very brave, because the powers that be do not like his type. They know that there is only one way to stop them, when once they have the power of the people behind them. Yang can most certainly get the power of the people behind him. I just hope that the security is much better now.
#####
Did y'all see this?  Not a scientific poll, but the Tulsa World is in one of the deepest of red states and only one vote was allowed per device.   They asked readers who would you vote for if election was today.  Yang got 38%, Trump got 20%, all other Dems less than Trump.  And that''s with Yang still with low name recognition.

 https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/government-and-politics/underdog-andrew-yang-scores-surprise-win-in-unofficial-presidential-poll/collection_5492570b-e11a-5dea-aa36-82b842f63ca1.html?fbclid=IwAR2-BKfpTP-9j30HVf0QEg30ya9IkW-D2-OoYhG6yzFsTgsuShIaEXMqz_0#1

Look at the views on the two videos they have with yang in the title compared to all there other views. 25k views here while all there others average like 1k views up to 14k for Pete but yang has one at 25k and 35k views
#####
Wow. Even showtime is giving Yang his justified screen time! Kudos!
#####
Yang Gang Baby!!!
#####
He definitely can.  You can see that all over Youtube comments.  If all those Trump voters who like Yang actually vote for Yang in the Dem primary (after re-registering as Dems for the purpose) there might be a Yang landslide to get the Dem nomination.
#####
Like this comment if you have never donated or voted for anyone. This is my first time to actually care about politics thanks to Andrew.
#####
....and then when the actual show finally streamed, they didn‚Äôt even edit in a clip of his Iowa speech, which was without a doubt one of the most compelling of the evening!They lingered on Mayor Pete and went straight to Warren after Biden. 
So, the producers and most likely, these pundits have their narrative and Andrew Yang is just a novelty to them, regardless of what they see on the ground. The skin of the DC bubble isn‚Äôt as thin as Donald Trump‚Äôs.  The off handed ‚Äúhe‚Äôll never be the nominee‚Äù, remarks made by the DC pundit class only serves to feed their narrative, which they, in turn, perpetuate among themselves like some incestuous mutant that is getting attention because it is , in fact, a mutation of reality that they have cobbled together using 20th century methods of polling and data gathering. There are far better and more detailed and accurate ways to read the data and get results.  Cambridge Analytica proved every major poll wrong in 2016.  The small sampling size and methods of the major polling outfits are statistically missing large swaths of voters that do not fall under the glow of their very narrow spotlight.  However, that skewed data is used to drive the MSM narrative. If one only watches MSNBC, FOX, CNN or any of the major networks, it seems like an alternate reality to those of us who use the internet and intellectual curiosity to check our own bias and nurture our objectivity with truth and facts. The regurgitated tropes become mind numbing while leading the tribalists  to their comfortable news bubbles where they can be fed more of their world view and ignore realities that could possibly run counter to their preferred beliefs. That would be uncomfortable. These shows need to be seen and watched for what they actually are: entertainment that has an agenda. And it certainly ain‚Äôt journalism!  Push the status quo that will keep the powerful in power. Job one. Mission accomplished.
#####
0:06 just a coincidence not a perv!
#####
#yangmediashoutout Alex -you need to excercise some critical thinking. Please do your research and make sure you wear a tie... Ask the right questions. I am loosing my humanity first listening to this...
#####
Yang is straight forward!!!
#####
Compare this video‚Äôs view count to the rest of this channel‚Äôs uploads. Andrew Yang is a huge draw. Nobody can excite the electorate more than this man, and the amount of views/clicks he generates is a product of that. People are beginning to pay attention, and we are only just beginning. #YangGang #YangBeatsTrump
#####
You need to give him more coverage, he‚Äôs not a fringe candidate & shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed.
Yang has real data driven policy ideas, with straight talk, no platitudes, rhetoric or identity politics.

She seemed stunned by his confidence. lol
#####
The problem is he is also peeling off Bernie voters - but he won't be able to peel off enough votes from Bernie to win the primary.  He will peel off enough for a centrist Democrat to win.
#####
I feel like he was sent here from the future to save us from ourselves. Yang 2020!
#####
I1m glad that this interview happened. The aired episode spent too short a time on Yang.
#####
She looks like she is smitten!!!

A moment in the history making for the whole world.

You make a good video about Yang, it‚Äôs gonna get a shit ton of views, likes, subscribers and shares.  The Yang Gang is obsessed and can‚Äôt get enough of this guy!

A.Y. is on the cover of the most current issue of Newsweek from 11/7-11/14!

I heard someone brough up a great idea:

Buy a few copies of that and drops them at doctors/dentists/clinics/hospitals office waiting rooms, as well as any other spaces such as the waiting area of car service/repair stations/ car wash waiting area/ you can think of where there is a magazine rack and Yang can get exposure just from his face on the cover of Newsweek!
The cheapest and most non-intrusive way of helping Yang getting extra exposure for those who has not yet heard of him!

A few copies of Newsweek is a Small investment for someone wanting to help out spreading Yang' s message, but may bring big rewards for the campaign!

Whenever he says he's one of two candidates, or one of the only candidates, that Trump supporters would vote for, he should also highlight the other candidate if he's trying to do what's best for the country.  Avoiding this means you're trying to win more than assist the people in electing the best person for the job.  This also gives credence to the idea that his first public ad being about medicare for all, or some attempt at it while using the same name, is strategically geared towards peeling away support from that other candidate, Bernie, that Trump voters would vote for.  That's as politician as it gets.

He says he thinks 100% he will be the nominee.  Pride before the fall.

Full disclosure: None of the current candidates including Bernie have earned my vote.
#####
He's against  med 4 all  and for a vat tax He should  drop out
#####
I wish he'd been shown more in the actual episode. But thank you for giving him some more exposure.

#yanggang

Yang is definitely on point. But he needs to have a plan to eventually get rid of those insidious health ins. cos.  Medicare for All has to be his ultimate goal.  Ins cos made over $20 billion in profits last yr.

Awesome. Yang FTW! He will be one of the last standing. Once that happens, he has the moment he needs

Yang has the best chance of winning simply because he is not a politician and you cant find dirt on him except to attack his policies which are pretty much bullet proof so yah I don't see how anyone can beat this guy he's got the upper hand #YangGang

Yang is the presidential candidate America needs to elect! He's the right person at this time!

Yang is an incredible leader.  His integrity, brilliance, and compassion really shine through.  Amazing to see him inspire and bring together such a diverse cool crowd of youth and professionals, etc.  Love the way Yang is using social media -- from live streams on Twitch -- to YouTube teams such as the Zach and Matt Show -- to a POP UP!  Brilliant!  It is also paramount that our next President understand technology.  Yang's expertise is undeniable -- and towers above any of the other candidates.  I encourage everyone to try to help donate to Yang's campaign.  Any amount helps.  I made my first campaign contribution ever last week to Yang.  Yang's policies are common sense based, realistic, and powerful.  We need a President with integrity and respect -- and one that can lead with compassion.  This groundswell of support that has been created around him is amazing!

Sit back and watch a fast your channels go to shit when you expose your political views.  Liberal media and Hollywood have these people brainwashed. It sad the see the amount of human beings so weak minded. Just a bunch of major city mascots for the Democratic Party.

here's a BLOOMBERG QUOTE "An introduction of a 5 percent¬†VAT, with a broad base which¬†would¬†cover about two-thirds of household consumption,¬†would increase¬†federal revenues by almost $3 trillion from 2020 through 2028, according to the CBO." so here's a small 5% vat tax will generate less than 375 billion a year for the next 8 years. ALL OF YOU CLAIMING YANGS VAT TAX WILL COVER THE 3 TRILLION A YEAR PRICE TAG, YOURE WRONG AND YOULL STILL BE ABOUT 2.625 TRILLION DOLLARS SHORT!!!!! So we now know yangs policy is one big lie. At least in terms of how it's going to be paid for. Plus! Products will cost 5 percent more. Man this policy is a disaster. No wonder why no1 can give me facts And numbers to explain... Because it's impossible and I just PROVED that! STOP BEING FOOLED PEOPLE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. I JUST PROVED THIS AS ANOTHER LIE FROM THE LEFT.

Vote people. Awesome that Adam is putting this content up but we have to vote. Less than 50% of young people between 18 and 30 vote.

Use it.

The support of Yang from Donald Glover is so massive. The man made the massive hit of This Is America, a very politically attentive song, and for people to see someone with the platform of Childish Gambino support Yang, it‚Äôll bring a ton of eyes.

Seems like he has alot of support from the homeless, jobless, and a bunch of entitled dumbasses. A bunch of lost, braindead infants.

He'll never be president. No gravitas, no charisma, no spark.

#####
Get yang in that white house!
#####
I want to know his stance on foreign affairs.
#####
TRICKLE UP ECONOMY= FREEDOM DIVIDEND = YANG 2020
#####
Need more of these videos
#####

#####

#####
BIDEN 2020
#####
Where was this ad ran?
#####
Americans are not capable of having an Asian president, the cant
#####
Yes Andrew Yang 2020
#####
Wait... so he advocates diplomacy with Iran, socialist universal income..... Where's the money to fund that coming from? Foreign sources? How's that sit with Americans?
#####
Yang alone isn‚Äôt enough. He needs to be able to inspire more people to engage in civic participation. If we as individual citizens don‚Äôt carry out our civic duties, we truly will go down the same path the romans did
#####
Fucking amazing
#####
Nice
#####
The Fight is now! Canvass out everyone, Merry Christmas and Happy new year Yang Gang!
#####
What would also help is the Hispanic vote. There is zero videos or ads in spanish. He really needs to expand his campaign.
#####
Yangftw
#####
Not hating at all I support Yang and I can‚Äôt find anything where he mentioned it. For the universal basic income & Medicare for everyone, where is that money going to come from?
#####
That‚Äôs üî•

This guy is a communist
#####
Trump 2020
#####
I feel like dems will never allow Yang to run. I bet trump could even say "If Andrew runs against me i will concede". Please God let Yang be President.
#####
Just donated to Yang, check out my yang vids
#####
Just imagine.....for a short moment in time....this man...wins....just let that sink in, slowly, that wonderful, optimistic idea.....that true, empathy driven, honest and most of all HUMANE future...but then again,  i was wrong in the past....so yea...
#####
This is beautiful
#####
Hello! I saw you first on The Drew Henderson show channel. I dont know well enough yet but this sounds good!
#####
So much for Andrew Yang!! A man, leader, and our future president!
#####
America, behold your sacred duty: elect Andrew Yang; save the world.
#####
an asian man who loves math?  hm....like that's news..... lol
#####
I wish I had money to donate to him. Oh wait, Yang‚Äôs giving us a thousand dollars per month. All the money I get from him I will give it back to him!
#####
these nonsense filled comercials will make me NEVER vote for this guy....re-write the rules for the 21st century?????....why? is this generation so weak it cant handle the rules that have givin him all this oppertunity?....sounds like a scocialist to me....YUCK!
#####
Great idea, better then giving food stamps and welfare benefits (how's that working out on the war on poverty).  Maybe even cheaper in the long run.  Or in order to get even more votes could give both, the Yang $1000/mo. kickback and welfare benefits. This could be the greatest idea in the history of the country, in redistributing the remaining 65% ( what left now after taxes) of middle class wealth into the new society where everyone lives on a $1000/mo. until inflation catches up and Americans see the folly of free money.  The theory here must be if everyone is poor who will notice!  Count me in, if the ship is going down anyway with ideas like this; why not grab what I can before the end!
#####
feeling envious as a chinese, you might have many problems hard to be dealt with ,but you have hope
#####
Trump supporter but would vote for him only democrat with some sense
#####
How about We paint every state blue in the 2020 General Election  because if Trump doesn't  go away in 2020 then it going to be 4 more years of Russia Russia Russia and Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine.  We need a President that unites the Democrats and Republicans. Not Divide the Parties like Trump has done. 2020 is gonna be a Most Excellent Year for the United States Of  America. üòÄüòéüåù
#####
not american, just here to like the videos so this guy gets more attention
#####
Like.
#####
I just donate a dollar here and there, its not much , but just enough .

To blow a cream load in your mouth in 2020 !!! Line up...Guys only...No Females !!! Let's make America get filled with a mouthful of Yang gangs cream..  LOL ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

As a member of the US armed forces, I will proudly salute you knowing you are fighting for the future of America as we are defending our freedom and democracy!
#####
So.... anyone who drives a Gasoline Automobile or flys in a plane is the main contributors to global warming Right... Almost 300 million Americans= 150 million+Automobiles polluting... Are you ready to live like the Amish Andrew Yang Gang and anyone else who believes in Global Warming... The planet is changing naturally and there is nothing we can do...to late for change... Hydrogen is the future but Money=oil ,,, Money rules the World sadly... You can make a difference but 90% people rather complain then actually make the difference... Think about it as you fly or drive, because your the problem lol Wait i thought plants use Co2??? ... Think about that lol
#####
There is one I could follow.There is one I could call The President!
#####
Well done America!
Get Andrew in that whitehouse and change the world. prosperity and hope for the human kind.
#####
A new way forward with data driven solutions.
#####
After seeing one of Andrew's commercial, I went and donated--I see the product of my contributions and I LOVE IT!  I love seeing his commercials--please post more!!!  Why can't the TV ads be available here too?  I love the Pharma commercial: "Old politics" won't tell you, "I [Andrew Yang] just did."  That was so powerful!
#####
yang for censorship when I speak the truth about yang being a chinese asset.
Not voting for chinkyang.
#####
So if I get $1,000 a month from Social Security I get nothing even though I paid into Social Security it's not free and the guy making $200,000 a year gets another thousand dollars a month this guy is brilliant.
#####
don't use her voice, it sounds like conspiracy propaganda to the right. Dude, put me on your team to do things correctly.
#####
His family is so damn beautiful and his kids look happy af
#####
Wow, what a powerful message, you got my support Yang. Seeing this ad makes me feel relieved that there is still hope left for America.
#####
He's got my vote. A professional truck driver.
#####
Wow that is some epic ads...

By the way, you guys should register to vote for the primary, thats the only way he will win. Not just giving him money.
#####
Republiyangs rise up
#####
I am so excited. Not about the UBI. I want THIS level of thinking, honestly, and real for our president. PLEASE do NOT let the DNC do to you what they did to Bernie. I love that you are letting MSNBC know what they did was wrong. Hopefully the realize how much we need you and pay more attention.
#####
I saw the sign people where holding over the highway do I get a prize?(I‚Äôm not serious)
#####
I dont think Yang would make it due to his national poll is still too low like only 3%. He will drop out soon. No offense but telling the truth.
#####
People are poor and stupid, and remain poor and stupid, because people keep looking for leaders. YOU ARE THE FUCKING LEADER. Andrew Yang is laughing all the way to the bank.
#####
Andrew hi, Look up Joe Rogan Experience interview with you and pls read my comment, because I believe you need to read what I wrote, it's important for you to know more and FYI if you understand our money structure so well then you'll also understand that with each birth we are commodities and our glorified birth certificate number proves it and on that note we all should have been receiving money all along,  plz do your  homework. Be wiser than the average person. Thank you I hope you achieve your goals ‚ù§Ô∏è
#####
I am 27 years old, and this is the first time I've decided it was worth voting. Don't hesitate, you can make a difference. Don't let this opportunity pass us by!
#####
I predict that this man will be the WINNER!!!! Take Trump down!!!!!!
#####
Also, the lowering of drugs prices may get passed
#####
And this is how many people want MrBeast, Andrew Yang, and Elon Musk to collab

üëáüèº
#####
Fed Ex robots on the street now!
#####
You know who likes Andrew Yang? Misogynists parading as feminists. Men who abused their high school girlfriends. Men who are bald and think they know everything. Men who receive privilege and think they know best how to do things The real people who care will vote for Bernie.
#####
Hey Andrew Yang. I know that this is a long shot that you will reply or that anyone would reply. I honestly did not want to vote because I was so torn with everyone's policies till I saw yours. However, I have a question: Who will qualify for the technology dividend? Would it include green card holders because they also contribute to the economy. And would that in turn, make getting a green card harder?
#####
Why no mention of the freedom dividend?
#####
YangGang is so cute in their loyalty and seem to be coming from across the aisle something which is rarely seen in america
P.S. i am not an american. It  is just my observation.
#####
Gonna drop some cash on Andrew yang again today!! 2020 let's make it happen everyone

Andrew yang 2020
#####
"Not a politician"
#####
Most reasonable candidate of democratic party. But UBI is not possible because America still has  128 trillion dollar in unpaid liability to its citizens in the name of different social security schemes. But love to Yang.
#####
Yeah, why not?
#####
Don't let the DNC bury you! üëÉüèªüëÉüèª

Sir you have my respect and my vote.

This my president

Only 600k views so far?

Yes!!! So good. So exciting. Yang is our President üôåüèΩ
#####
Holy hell, I'm Canadian and I got chills. Hoping you guys win this!
#####
I love this. I think you should stick with "Humanity First" rather than "A New Way Forward". But I love both regardless.
#####
vamossss carajooo!!!!!
#####
It's unrealistic to only have one person in the position of President. All the things listed here are NOT EVEN CLOSE to all the life threatening problems facing America right now. Our government is broken and in desperate need of revision since Bush announced it broken 10 years ago. We should have 2 Presidents and 2 Vice Presidents to better protect and speak for the billions of Americans.
#####
Americans, make Andrew Yang your president in 2020.
#####
Go Andrew go !!!! Andrew for 2020!!! !! üòéüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
#####
You need to mention "We are the richest and Most advanced country in the world" IN EVERY SPEECH,INTERVIEW, AND DEBATE. This will shift your audience into a mindset of abundance immediately! PLEASE PASS THE WORD TO ANDREW.
#####
too bad he's on the side full of crazies, if trump wasn't the sitting president with a second term and yang ran on the republican side, he'd actually have a shot. he's gotta appeal to too many indoctrinated retards who will tip the scales in the favor of the retards hes up against to get the nomination.
#####
I don‚Äôt think he can win the nomination, unfortunately, but if he did he‚Äòd beat Trump easily. There is not that much controversial about him. Eschewing a public health care option in favor of a focus on costs reductions and technological innovation won‚Äôt exactly thrill Medicare for All supporters, but you have to weigh that against literally putting money into citizens‚Äô hands, every single month, with no strings attached whatsoever.

Look, I know Sanders says you‚Äôve been talking about universal health care since Teddy Roosevelt, but getting from here to there in just four years is not realistic. If he‚Äôs not willing to even propose a longer time frame then he could actually lose to Trump, if he even wins the nomination. Many Americans will probably think, ‚Äúwell, at least he‚Äôll fight for my interests!‚Äù, but there‚Äôs always a risk that centrists Dems feel he is taking them for granted and decide to stay home.

Andrew Yang, on the other hand, can appeal to both progressives and also government-skeptic voters who still don‚Äôt feel the system is working for them. Honestly, from what I know about America, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Andrew Yang won Texas.
#####
YANG 2020
#####
I'm not even sure what these 2 candidates believe in, but just because they are being smeared by Clinton and shunned by the media, makes me trust them more than the other candidates.
#####
I'm 32 years old and have voted Republican every year I could since I turned 18 and joined the Army and let me just say, Andrew Yang may change that for me! He's exactly where I'm at in the Left-Right political system that runs out country and that's right in the middle, willing to work with either Republican or Democrat to do what's best for our country and our people!
#####
That was majority of his speaking time.  He only had a fraction of the speaking time of Biden and warren and yet he came out looking 10x better.  I‚Äôve never seen anything like this from a politician in my life.  He‚Äôs destined to be our president.  I‚Äôm sure of it.  Yang 2020
#####
I like Yang for addressing these important hidden issues like the 4th industrial revolution.                                                                                                         He is a crucial voice of reason.
I see him as a  Human face for VP  candidacy for either the Biden/ Sander  camp ticket contingency that resolves several  issues: 
A) the age of the elder statesmen candidate who both need a wider sparkplug issue  to attract a wider youth base  appeal, 
b) a wider platform to both counter charges of  Dem anti-business sentiment C) while offering to offset perceptions of an off-center power balance; between the growing level of corporate influence on the public due to a serious  lack of government oversight.
D)Yang could contribute another way to deflect and offset concerns about competent presidential succession if it were to arise as a campaign issue.
#####
.
#####
I have watched this over a dozen times.
#####
That was beast!
#####
I am just wondering if MSNBC would've been okay putting the red background on biden or warren... almost resembles of Chinese flag.  Just wondering..
#####
Andrew yang for president!!üá∫üá≤
#####
i hope to god our country is smart enough to narrow it down to bernie sanders vs andrew yang for the democratic nomination. joe biden should be nowhere close to the conversation!
#####
"Your country loves you, your country values you, and you'll be alright" what a powerful line to end on.   
Had to come back to this after finding out he made it into the December debate.
#####
That ending part makes me tear up a bit.
#####
This makes me tear up whenever I watch it.
#####
Good speech.  Too bad it makes no sense in light of the best economy ever.
#####
Interesting he kinda sounds like Kermit the frog üê∏
#####
You wouldn't do anything to fix our national debt, taxes, or our border.
#####
Wow that was beautiful .....

üáπüáºüá®üá≥üá∞üáµüêâüêâüêâ666.yang.

Once again, he spoke the least, but managed to say the most.
#####
Yang 2020 or l am leaving the USA.  RELIGION IS NOT THE OPIUM OF THE PEOPLE BUT IGNORENTS IS BY NOT LISTEN.
#####
Andrew Yang hit his 2M dollars by end of November campaign goal on the dot. 
     1.5M dollars were generated in the last 2 days of the month, with people donating even as little as a dollar to help him win the Presidency. 
     Yang is truly becoming The People's Candidate. Amazing. 
      We are going all the way to the White House. Yang 2020.,
#####
Wow. Get this guy on the ballot.
#####
Let's sign up for the Yangbang
#####
Can you please make math hats that can accommodate black hair? Can you please invite us to the Yang gang party? How are we supposed to fight for you without proper uniformsüôèüèæ
#####
I am a dialectician, I believe in Andrew Yang.
#####
Real talk
#####
This man continues to impress me.  I believe he is the real deal!  He has my support for sure!
#####
Only Andrew Yang can beat Donald Trump.. mark my words!!
#####
I guess if yang is going for it 2020 the fall of white mans world and dreams....our children our women all in danger red alert.....call of duty against yang.......
#####
Yang would be a shoe in for POTUS against Trump but the DNC is gonna screw this up again
#####
If this TRUMP wins expect day of judgment ... eventually.
#####
Americans, get this smart guy Andrew Yang into the White House.  Nominate anyone other than him = the Democrats will not get into the White House.
#####
Thank you, Andrew Yang, for showing up each day and fighting the good fight.  I'm certain I speak not only for myself when I say that I'm a better person because you dared to enter the ring.
#####
Your contry loves you, your country values you..
I dunno made me tear up a bit. I wish I could say that to my buddies. Hes gotta be president so much better than "tHaNk yOU foR yoUR sERvICE"
#####
It‚Äôs Yang or Trump. Simple. Yang 2020!
#####
This was amazing!
#####
Yang 2020.
#####
We are being invaded. That is not our flag behind him.
#####
The mainstream media is suppressing him because he cannot be bought. This man does not care about fame legacy or money, just the opportunity to create a better future for his kids and your kids. His vision, integrity and a genuine interest in elevating all Americans is pure and is the single biggest threat to the power that be and elitist controlling the government.  

I genuinely fear for his well being the closer he gets to actual power. Nevertheless Yang2020!!!‚úä‚úä‚úä
#####
My true inspiration. Yang Gang!
#####
They don't ask him questions because they know he has the answers
#####
Man, that tugs at the heartstrings
#####
Insert ‚ÄúKids aren‚Äôt alright‚Äù by Offspring
#####
I love this guy.
#####
You nailed it yang! Amazing job!
#####
needs to be our nominee.
#####
I just don‚Äôt trust this Chinaman. Better dead than red!
#####
Andrew Yang may be one of the smartest people EVER. The dudes a genius. Love him.
#####
No thanks TRUMP 2020
#####
I will make you next on the mailing list Andrew....if you go to DC as President you will just immerse yourself in the business as usual environment

the change you speak of has already been advised twenty months ago and it is not in the DC environment

cheers and best
#####
There will always be jobs  jobs will change.
#####
Only Democrat running who isn't a complete dumbass or a phony.
#####
I'd gladly vote for him in 2024 as a republican
#####
Please stop with this nonsense, you will not be president, just like Kamala, Booker, Kloebuchar, Biden, Warren, Gabbard, Delaney, Williamson, Styer, Bloomberg..the only candidate with the grass roots movement and cash from people is Bernie Sanders.. Yang followers love math and data.. what are the numbers for People donating to Bernie over Andrew, what do the polls say about same two.. I am upset as you're all are with the Democratic and Republican party but Yang is no front runner yet.. so become an ally Yang gang and make him a senator/Congress, hell he can Bernies Advisors or even VP.. your thoughts?
#####
Meanwhile the rest of the politicians, with few exclusions, want to distract you with partisan hackery and social media disinformation while the oligarchs rob our country blind. They're selling your future and your children's futures to corporations, because in a consumer based society YOU ultimately become the product.
#####
Your rich. Your kids will be alright
#####
A Democrat with a brain. Him and Gabbard are the only 2 hopes the Dems have at this point. All the others are insane.
#####
I like this man he's real. Honest and straightforward.
#####
BERNIE/YANG 2020
#####
If God used a donkey, 
Numbers 22:21
He certainly used Donald Trump.
#####
Not gonna lie, that was a good closing statement.
#####
This charismatic socialist really has you people hooked huh? 
God bless America 
God bless President Trump 
Trump 2020 - See Clearly
#####
I made a portrait painting of Andrew Yang on my Channel. Would love it if y'all could check it out üòäüëç
#####
What he says sounds good but he won't be the nominee because  they  are  hellbent on trying to push an ultra left agenda that the American public  does not  want .
#####
That just got real. Honestly I'm torn either Bernie or Yang 2020 hell Tulsa 2020
#####
So brilliant and not a single stutter!! About time he starts speaking in major cities like ole ATL wish I was home to see that debate missed it though, hopefully he comes around Oklahoma City? Or hell even Dallas
#####
Still polling at 2%. Yang has no chance and UBI is a joke.
When he drops out he will start a book tour and rake in the cash.
#####
Who tf is this asian dude apperently running for president and why do i already want to vote for him after seeing one video go kick trumps fat ass
#####
Beautiful. He‚Äôs such a smart human being.
#####
Stellar closing statements
#####
I am on disability and get $1050 a month and would take the freedom dividend of $1000 instead.  On disability I am only aloud to work so much before it is taken, with a freedom dividend I could work as much as I wanted without fear of loosing this much needed payment.
I am not OK with living in fear for wanting to better my life.
#####
The only Democrat I actually like.
#####
Why do you all continuously bicker about him not receiving "enough time" he makes more sense in 60 seconds then any of the other candidates ever would in 45 minutes! Lmao, you see the strategy, you see the plan.... just support the campaign, register and vote for him next year and he will execute. You all wanted a new fresh slate..... Here's your shot.... Don't miss it. I sure won't be missing mine.
#####
I don‚Äôt agree with Yang‚Äôs so call solutions.  But I believe he is honest in his intentions, and while I don‚Äôt se myself voting for a democrat, I can‚Äôt help but like this man.
#####
When the other candidates like to talk about their accomplishments, their educational pedigree, and their successes, Andrew Yang talks about the problems and presents solutions that are practical and ingenious. 
A true leader acts as a servant to those who he/she serves. That is a trait inherent in every great leader: putting others before their own. 
The only serious Democratic candidate in the DNC is Andrew Yang. He isn't in it for the fame, money or prestige. Instead, he is in it to solve the problems of this country, to push the country forward. I hope the rest of America can see this.
#####
This dude has the ability to restore our faith in our country and government. This dude would alleviate so many mental issues just from that
#####
He gets it!
#####
I am a conservative/libertarian but dang I agree and support 99.9% of that speech, keep it up Yang!
#####
Whose with the yang gang?
#####
If Yang doesn't make it keep Trump in office another 4 years. Hopefully after those years we can get Yang in
#####
Yang will destroy Trump!
#####
I don't want to sound religious at all but Yang has guaranteed himself a spot at God's table üåà.
#####
Andrew is Smart with a Heart. Everyone should know about his message. He is truly for the People!
#####
I like Yang but if UBI was a good idea, why are Native American reservations some of the most undeveloped and squalid places in the US?
#####
Yea yang im a yang ganger Go Andrew u will have my vote and support thankfully jeannine grant
#####
I think that he would make a good vice president under Bernie.
#####
I wish he's not Asian so a candidate with a heart and mind as beautiful as his would actually stand a chance in today's America.
#####
I'm a conservative always have been....... I never thought there would be a day I would EVER vote Democrat. Well that day has changed! Yang for president 2020. You've got my vote thank you for such an inspirational closing statement, and giving me hope that we can still have hope for the American dream.
#####
If they can't buy Yang and use him how they want to, then he'll get screwed over. Just like they did to Bernie. Politics are a sad state of affairs.
#####
Bernie for Yang 2020
#####
Dang...
#####
No one else running cares more about our kids' future than Andrew Yang.
#####
Yang gang out y‚Äôall. PEACE! 

*Throws up a sign, tosses on a pair of shades and strolls off the stage*

Keep it gangster Mr. Yang. The ruling class won‚Äôt let you win. But you are awakening people to new ideas and possibilities and that‚Äôs a good start.
#####
You're the fuking man Yang!! ‚ù§
#####
I have a better chance of winning the Presidency than this guy does.
#####
I really want him to be president I do but I'm 100% certain the DNC will pick Joe Biden
#####
If the Democrats place Yang as the nominee, I will likely vote for him. Red blooded oil field worker. The other candidates are proposing measures that will not just cost me my job (I don't care, I am and engineer with construction experience willing to travel) but the schools and communities can't afford it. The pipelines are paying the schools more than. The state where I live. The oil companies are providing fire and Em's vehicles for free. The area dies with the industry and the others look to kill it. I will move and leave it, others are too poor. He actually has an idea that could boost these communities and give them an opportunity to survive oil and gas. If he isn't the nominee then we repeat 2016 and I, and many others will vote Trump because of the insanity of the other candidates. They have had decades in office and haven't even touched the issues they run on. Yang or Trump. Take your pick.
#####
behind every great man is an even greater woman

Broomberg is fake shiiit!

Go Carly!

IT‚ÄôS ‚ÄúABOUT LOCAL FREE MARKET ECONOMIES

Andrew Yang's Use Case Modeling for a Trickle-up Local Community-based Free Market Economy
Background:
What is a Use Case Model? 
A use-case model shows how different types of people (or users) interact with a system (i.e., Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freedom Dividend (FD)) to solve (in this use-case) economic devastation in local community economies). This use-case (Trickle-up economy) describes the goals of its community adult residents, in coordinating free-market strategies, and the overall economic behavioral goals to revitalize or develop small businesses, employment and healthcare need within their local economy.

Preview of Our Future
Date: November 9th, 2020; Democratic Nominee Andrew Yang Wins the general election and becomes the 2020 President-Elect. 
Date: February 21, 2021; Freedom Dividend HRxx bill is enacted into law, and because of the ease of implementation (IRS will distribute the $1000 Freedom Dividend starting April 1, 2021.


Community Action Strategies Across the Nation:
Date: February 22, 2021; Mayors, Commissioners, and or Community leaders of three communities (Appalachian-American, African American, and Hispanic- American) having a population of one thousand adults (age 18 and up) in each respective community began holding town meetings strategies with 90% (900) participation out of a population of 1000 adults.


How a Trickle-up Community-based Free-Market Strategy Might Work?
Planning Scenario:
In trickle-up community-based capitalism, there are numerous free-market pathways to build or rebuild a trickled-up economy, such as through enterprise resource planning (ERP). In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‚Äòdwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. 

Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: 
Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially. Thus, re-writing the rules of a ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô community-based economy that locally, regionally works for them.

Question: What is your community population? What might work for your local community of a population of 1000-10,000?

Come on THINK HARDER!
#####
Thanks, Carly.  How could I help??? I already donated.  When is Yang stopping by Wisconsin?
#####
For someone who fired a women "because she got married", he is a nice guy
#####
this is great !

I met Carly at an event today. Chatted for a bit. She‚Äôs no joke!  Super impressive, and very cool to boot.  Hope to see you again Carly!

No Yang. Lies about support for Medicare for All. Isn't for canceling all student debt, isn't for a living wage, won't fight for anything. No no no. Full of phonyness. Bernie all day!
#####
Time for Yang to bow out
#####
Carly Reilly, Gran respeto a usted chingona!  Yang 2020! (Tulsi Gabbard would make a very potent vice president)

The most expensive is real estate industry. Andrew yang's zoning law policy can help low income family to self build home and liberate from city high house rental and high house prices.
#####
Policy change zoning law based on home ownership for all American poverty people is very important than money donation and Medicare. The most expensive is real estate market. Many people are because of low salary can't pay off high house rental and can't satisfy high life fee to cause homelessness.
#####
He can win to depend on policy change zoning law for all American poverty people and low income family and low salary people's group.
#####
UBI is feminist?  If it is then it would exclude men so it cannot be feminist.  So her initial tweet was wrong.
#####
She's amazing!!!!!!
#####
Flop campaign. Not gonna go anywhere. Stop wasting people's money.
#####
He has no chance in 2020. Zero. He‚Äôs like a Zebra in a crocodile infested swamp. 

He‚Äôs a nice guy with good intentions but he lost my vote when he was asked how he‚Äôd deal with Noko and he answered ‚ÄúI‚Äôd call up Noko and say Hey let‚Äôs work something out.‚Äù LOLS!!! okay there bud.
#####
10.5 trillion American dollars in the world,  yangs yearly pay out 30 trillion, do the math, if that's not enough 80 trillion dollars value of all countries money in the world, yang would need it all to for the program to last 2.5 years, and if that's not enough The feds take in 3.25 trillion in tax revenue per a year, so Andrew need 10.2 years of tax revenue to pay for 1 year, you are not getting you $1,000.00 per a month for life time unlessss you work for it and you can earn more just working for it.

Yang is the first candidate I‚Äôve ever donated to
#####
Carly is amazing. More women like her should be recognized for their key contributions! I love Yang and she's a big part of helping him succeed.
#####
Yang Gang 2020
#####
Sh looked so much Elizabeth holmes
#####
I hope Carly doesn't call me. I couldn't tell her no.
#####
Hes gonna rip america to the chinese, wtf!!
#####
4chan has become a pool of shit in recent years. Too bad.
#####
Thanks for what you do; I am sorry you where attacked! He is now a true phenomenal, and we pray for him, his family and team's safety
#####
Was 4Chan really targeting Carly the only message I seen from this is Carly shills for Israel. If this is true how would this be targeting women??? Hell I've been seeing more Women in my age group with a job then Men and being paid more for the same retail or fast food work.
#####
Carly, your doing awesome!! It is the historic moment. It won‚Äôt come again and again. Go go yang 2020!!

Andrew Yang will shape the world for better place without a doubt cz I hv been listening his thoughts for sometimes and all make sense !! He is super intelligent and very kind man. Vote for Andrew  if u care humanity. From Canada
#####
Are there people who are actually happy to receive calls about donations at 7h00?
#####
3:16 You're right men don't face this, that's because they don't report these events because it'll show weakness in their eyes. Statements like "like a girl" "man up" are contributing to the drastic increase in male suicide rates compared to the declining female suicide rates.
#####
wish i was an american so i could vote for this man
#####
Get him on JRE again!!
#####
That last message though, It's totally unrelated to the video and is a promotion of the boss
#####
What I'd like to know is: How long has this been going on?  Is this something that I was supposed to be getting?  Is the $1,000/mo. the rightful award?  What changed everyone's mind?  If I was supposed to be getting at least something (but wasn't) where is the crime?
#####
So this is the girl who has been sending me all those emails for donations
#####
No more big money campaigns.
#####
casual bloomberg shill at the end there
#####
Yang would make an excellent Republican president üëçbut he shouldn't be running for leader of a left wing party. Both parties have been run by the same types of people for too long. Corporatists. That's a problem. Alot of us are completely unrepresented. Real leftists. It's really not very fair and not democratic that only capitalists are represented in government.
#####
Not all heroes wear capes.
#####
Thank you Carly for everything you‚Äôve done for this campaign!! We DO like what we are seeing!!! :D
#####
If you‚Äôre American, the first step to Andrew Yang becoming your President is believing he can win. The second step is donating and telling everyone you know about him. The third step is actually voting for him!!!
#####
Men face the same ruthless attack online as women. The language is different but same viciousness
#####
imagine calling women morons while running for president...
#####
I was lowkey hoping they would show Evelyn but this girl rocks!
#####
I really hope everyone in the comments who‚Äôs of age actually goes out and votes!
#####
I support Yang, but everyone faces harassment on the internet, not just women. Doxxing can happen to anyone and it sucks regardless of who it happens to
#####
Shitty Edit but I love you Carly!
#####
Lol, dont get on the wrong side of 4chan
#####
She looks legit. I am shy so it is very hard for me to ask for money or even small favor. She seems to be the exact type of person who will be amazing in action for this type of position. Strong woman indeed.
#####
Great job, you are a brave woman!
#####
I'm fapping to Carly! Sorry, but not really sorry!
#####
Carly is awesome
#####
She seems awesome. Has anything good EVER come out of 4chan?
#####
The bad trolls should‚Äôve used gender neutral insults... fkn misogynistic trolls.
#####
I‚Äôm very happy üòÉ andrew Yang is gonna take money from you guys and give it me yay üòÅ.
#####
Wow she's smart and beautiful.
#####
What a bunch of bs
#####
Impressive young leader!
#####
how the hell did klobachar already qualify for the January debates?
#####
4chan = eternal virgins aka incels
#####
Damn, she must be calling some big ballers asking for $1,600!
#####
Ngl this was a really good video...up until they had to mention Bloomberg.
#####
Bloomberg, put the Democratic primary disclaimer at the top of your videos please! I‚Äôm glad you are doing it, but do the fully right thing and put it at the top!
#####
I love Carly, she is the reason why I donate more than I should
#####
Bruh men are also doxxed by 4chan.
#####
What? She doesn‚Äôt know that men get more doxxed than women. It‚Äôs not only targeted to girls.
#####
I guarantee you that if there was ranked based voting there would be dozens of these people running each election.
#####
I want to join the Campaign I live in the Philippines but the American Citizens living abroad are not recognized. WE VOTE too, it is time for the website to indicate that, so we can put in our Zip Codes and Join.

Andrew Yang proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally ‚Äì most would prefer cash with no restriction.

A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

The means to pay for the basic income will come from four sources:

1. Current spending: We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like. This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because people already receiving benefits would have a choice between keeping their current benefits and the $1,000, and would not receive both.

Additionally, we currently spend over 1 trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like. We would save $100 ‚Äì 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up. Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.
2. A VAT: Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone. A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue. A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

3. New revenue: Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy. The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy will grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. This would generate approximately $800 ‚Äì 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth.

4. Taxes on top earners and pollution: By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend. We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.
#####
Her Fake "Good Morning" calls make everyone ready to spend money desperately wishing she not call them ever again! 

P.s. I'm Andrew Yang supporter and actually like this lady too, but simply cannot resist to put this comment with hope make you smile! :) 
Merry Christmas Everyone!

Vote for Yang! $12,000 a year will makes a huge difference for struggling single moms, struggling college students and families that need extra financial support while growing their new business. Our country needs Andrew Yang. All people, black, white, yellow and red will vote for Andrew Yang. Our country economy will boom!

I keep watching his speech over and over and never get tired of it. He reminds me of the greatest Dr. MLK speech.
#####
It is the return of a true president... Return of   America... Return of the yangyang.. vote yang.. yang for the future..
#####
He is different.  He is on the money.  I am voting for him
#####
This is amazing. A man who understands why Trump won is already a step in the right direction. It shows he has listened and understood.
#####
He really is bringing back return of the Mack!!! I fucking love it
#####
Never forget. There are only two reasons why Joe Biden is currently leading in the national polls.

1. Older people respond to national polls.
2. Young people don't.

We Need an Asian president. 
Of course yang is a numbers guy, he‚Äôs Asian.

WOW 160,000 views, Andrew Yang must win for a better future in America. Vote Andrew Yang in 2020. Thank you.
#####
I love this song!  Lol.  Funny this song and I meet again and in a perfect place.  I just donated to his campaign.  He's intelligent, not a politician, truly wants to make America think harder again.  We have been so dumbed down through lies coming from Left and Right.  My niece left public school to be home schooled because of bullying. The boy was going to set her hair on fire.  Our kids are killing people with guns, too.  Our kids were blindsided by politicians selling America to other countries and lost their jobs because of it.  Also, politicians giving big corporations a free ride on taxes while taxing us close to 50%.
#####
I sometimes listen to this to get motivated to work out
A true G
I'm not even American!
#####
one thing for sure californians wont vote for yang
he gave up on them
as they are all owned by other candidates
#####
Our kids will be alright under a Yang Presidency. And so will be most Americans, Yang2020.
#####
President Andrew Yang & First Lady Evelyn Yang. Talk about a FRESH NEW START for America!!!!! The world would breath a huge sigh of relief!!!! (The Orange One has exhausted us all!!!!)
#####
my left ear enjoyed his speech
#####
2:00 : Our kids are not alright because we fucked them over and left them a dark future to live our own nice lives
*applause*
???
#####
he won't be the POTUS but he's best
#####
The latest move prize in economics agree with Andrew Yang and the freedom dividend. There is actual data to back up what he is claiming will happen. Look it up, Abhijit bannerjee, esther duflo and Michael Kremer.
#####
I‚Äôm not even a citizen but I donated anyway lol
#####
2020 we imagined we finna have flying cars and it will be the feature. And we need technological advance and to do that we need someone like this. Energetic new and technological
#####
Interesting candidate. Not sure if the $1000 a month will pan out well, it sounds to me that companies will jack up their prices in order to get their hands on that money, essentially canceling out any benefit the extra money may provide. Not to mention it will cost about $81750000000 a month to provide $1000 to every household. (Roughly estimated, with 4 people assigned per household). 

Still, he is very energetic and optimistic, and a better candidate than most of the other Democrats, and I look forward to see how he does.
#####
President Yang 2020
#####
I had the HONOR and privilege of seeing Andrew speak twice now, and he GAVE ME a copy of his book, which I READ, and I've watched his videos....
Seems to me, out of ALL the other Democracker candidates, ONLY YANG is the "Anti-Trump"!.... But he's not running against Trump, he's running FOR AMERICA!  Get Yang-hied, get YANG GANGED, get on the bus to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave...."President-elect Andrew Yang" sure sounds GOOD 2 ME!!....
#####
This man spits out the numbers and stats like FIRE!  A debate between him and The Don will be legendary.  "Not LEFT, not RIGHT, but FORWARD!"

You gonna be alright

When the political race is nothing but a dried up desert of same ol, same ol, here comes a dose of cool water over your head.
#####
This guy has charisma! Yang for president
#####
For a lot of you that still don't believe that automation is taking over, I used to work for a company that had already starting forcing us to look into things that can be automated. I was new to the mainframe field and part of our job was to look for mainframe jobs that failed at the same step a repeatedly and to escalate the issue to the programmers to provide a permanent fix for them. I knew where that was headed. Once all the mainframe jobs no longer fail, the vast majority of people in those mainframe jobs are going to be laid off. I saw the signs and I left for a better job. Anything that is repetitive will be automated. The managers and supervisors are going to simply lie to your face stating that it's not going to affect you or anyone on the team. But I've seen many layoffs as high as VP positions. Don't believe me, then you have nothing to blame but yourself if you don't vote for Andrew Yang.
#####
This gave me the chills, and I am not even American! Wishing you every success, sir ... from Singapore.
#####
My pastor recently told me he thought Andrew lacked charisma and seemed stiff when he speaks. I immediately assumed he had only seen a couple of the earlier debates. I was right. I sent him this video and it blew him away
..
#####
Andrew Yang is so well-spoken and explains everything so well!
#####
$1000 A MONTH WILL CHANGE FAMILIES LIVES FOR THE BEST!!!! IT WILL BE A FEW PEOPLE STILL COMMITTING CRIME, BUT IT WILL DROP DRAMATICALLY!
#####
"This is not a town of leaders, its a town of followers..." Wow.
#####
I'd love to hear more about his take on the tax code... That's how he's gonna foot the bill for the UBI.
#####
Strategie-suggestion to ALL of you Yang-supporters: Dont waste time on only watching Yang-Videos! Instead go to videos about his greatest opponents (currently Bernie, Biden and Warren) and talk to their supporters in the comment-section. But NOT by being confrontational or mindlessly copy-pasting YOUR opinion without even listening to the content of their video! 

Think about it, how would YOU most likely be convinced to change your mind? 

a) By someone who ACTUALLY WATCHED the video you love and ACTUALLY LISTENED to the arguments made in the video AND THEN debunked each single one? 

b) By someone who doesn't adress ANY of the arguments and simply copy-pastes text about why to vote for THEIR favorite candidate?
Don't just spam their comment section! This might cause the opposite effect and make them want to vote even less! Think about these annoying vegans who try to shame you into doing what THEY want. Don't operate like them! Show interest and actual understanding for where they're coming from and then offer your perspective!
#####
$1000 is not free, every American deserve it, because US corporations have paid zero tax while using the roads, infrastructure, security provided by US tax payers.
#####
I donated to his campaign
#####
Never donated to any politician, but im going to do it!!!
#####
Chills
#####
Lo & Behold!  The 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Economists' (Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo) new book (just dropped Nov. 12, 2019) supports Andrew Yang Policies on UBI and rewriting the rules of the U.S. Economy. (Chapter 9; Cash & Care)  - Banerjee (et al.) 2019, Good Economics for Hard Times. pgs. 3, 277-288) Yang, is disturbingly accurate!
#####
Teaching not belittling!!!
#####
*üíôVote for Yang 2020üíô*
#####
If this is an indicator of his support in January 2020's debate in Iowa, then Yang will demolish the other Democrats.
#####
From Andrew Johnson to Andrew Yang.....!!!!
#####
ANDREW YANG will be one of the greatest presidents of our time.
Smart, passionate, likeable, funny, people-centered, humane, witty, engaging, compelling, pragmatic, and solution-oriented.
#####
He'll annihilate Trump in the debate. Trump all have to say is he made economy better for his 4 yrs term and Yang will make Trump look like a whiny kid better than Touchy touchy Biden or Sanders.

I watched so many Andrew yang video, and I heard his speech dozen of times..

Now I am listening to the same speech, again, without skipping it forward. 

Is something wrong with me?

I just contributed $10 to yang gang, hooray!

Nothing wrong with the Kids Mr. Wang , Everything wrong with the fake education they get.

If you Americans elect this guy to be your president we will love you and you will regain again your respect

The best speech of 2019
#####
wait... when Andrew says "hellooooooo Iowaaaaa" is he actually singing the intro to the song?! hahahaah pleeeease
#####
Man i wish he was our president! So jealous of u Americans!
#####
Wow, this was the best speech I've heard from a candidate in a very long time.
#####
He is so popular with the people that the Democratic Party will have no choice but to make him the nominee.
#####
I accidentally pressed this video
#####
This man is way to reasonable, logical and mindful to let slip through our hands.
#####
@2:20 Boom
#####
Pessimism brings me down. Government isn't the answer. Free the people from overwhelming regulation.
#####
This man make me cry! Is it possible to love a complete stranger? Mr. Andrew Yang Thank you for speaking for people like me who been devalued for so long. Thank you Sir!
#####
the problem will be the late 30 to 50ish crowd.  If those are knocked off by automation how will you retrain millions of people.  Not everyone can be a computer programmer or computational scientist.
#####
I am not for unconditional 1000 a month.  IF you make six figures a year you don't need that money, if you make under 50,000 you do need it.
#####
I don't think Andrew Yang should be President of the United States in 2020..... 


He should be President of the world!!!
#####
to anyone who sees this, make a comment to improve the algorithm so it recommends this video
#####
I too love some of his talking points, but I too am a math guy. How will he pay for such things as his statements make it out? He states a 10% VAT tax(in addition to our current taxes). This will across the board increase prices of everything around 10-15%. Does he think businesses will just not increase prices if they are taxed more? I would as well love to get 1K a month for free, but is it actually free? Doing so will double the federal budget every year! Currently the Fed takes in 3.4 trillion and this alone(not counting free college, free healthcare, free whatever else is on the ticket) will add 3 trillion to that budget nearly doubling it. His proposed VAT tax according to him will provide around 600 Billion or 20% of that number. Where is the other 80% coming from? Note that the 80% means increasing your taxes by 75%.  As we all now government expenditures normally are changed quite often, but taxes almost never go down. So what happens when they repeal the 1K a month and keep all the added taxes?
#####
We need a Yang presidency point blank periodt. For everyone. Republicans and democrats alike.
#####
"paid for by friends of Andrew Yang" not by some billionaires or corporations... People who donated to his campaign are his friends... Ur the friends of the next American president man!!
#####
Who was responsible for the audio during the filming?

Been campaigning for Yang for months now, I'm going to have the biggest street cred when I can claim responsibility for America's $1000/mo.
#####
I see you Amherst College! üòÉ
#####
I would save that $1000 each month so I could retire early as so to give another one who needs it. This is called job movement in order provide more job opportunities.
#####
This doesn't need testing. It works 100%! My life will be better getting extra 1k a month.
#####
Really hurts my thumb, pressing like button on an NBC clip.
#####
This money will help us!!! stop trying to make it look impossible, but yet we can afford trillions for wars, and who ask us if it was ok to bail out banks with trillions $s. Yang 2020
#####
PLEASE HELP ME
#####
Yang should pick two small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Then project the impact of the Freedom Dividend on both towns.  The direct and indirect benefits to both towns.
#####
*Trust me the Democrats will stop this for sure as shüí©t stinks. They love to keep people oppress that why they didn't want him on stage.*
#####
#YangGang #Yang2020 this is great! Im a RN, 36 yrs, can only work 24 hrs a week max. I think it's a great idea!
#####
‚ÄúPlenty of other countries?‚Äù Literally every industrialized country has a VAT, except for the United States. Every. Single. One. And the average VAT in Europe is 20%, double that of the 10% we‚Äôd need to fund the Freedom Dividend. Furthermore, the money doesn‚Äôt go to government programs. It goes directly to the people, who have the freedom to spend it in any way they choose. There‚Äôs nothing more American than that.
#####
Most economists say vat is bad yet most countries have it and it helps fund their social programs for disadvantaged  people. Ok ‚Äúmost economists‚Äù
#####
YANG GANG 2020
#####
Yes! Everyone needs to be a winner this election season! Yang is for the people!
#####
The best way to stimulate the economy and restoring local small businesses is by giving cash straight to the hands of consumers. $1000/month to everyone is a game changer.
#####
NBC is the Fox News equivalent for Democrats. Unfair and bias media.
#####
Yang 2020!!   
But the 1K a month should ONLY go to those making less than 100k a year.  That‚Äôs the only part that I disagree with him on.  The difference of not paying those can go to Education!!
#####
I m not sure? Cmon bro, let ME have ur freedom dividend then
#####
When news try‚Äôs and pick who they want president and make the others look bad lmao
#####
We have tried everything else and failed ! Government always taking money and doing nothing ! And when crisis happens they choose BANKS OVER PEOPLE !!
So THIS TIME WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHING NEVER TRIED BEFORE !!! Money to people !!! People over banks and corrupt government!!!
WHATS THE DOWNSIDE ? We are not succeeding with current solutions anyways so what‚Äôs there to lose anyways ! 
LETS GIVE YANG A CHANCE ! Let‚Äôs give America a chance
#####
Other politicians  ( Raise taxes and  take money from people to governammt  )  free healthcare , free education , free socialism : GOOD IDEA ( don‚Äôt care and ask if money will come from anywhere and how coz Sounds good ) 
freedom dividend : GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT üò±üò±üò± , nahhhhhh ,  how will we pay for it , long shot , ohhhh , ehhhhhh , whattttttttttt
#####
Failed try !!! THIS IS A GREAT IDEA ! And 1000$ dollars is not TO SOLVE AND LIVE ON MONEY !! It‚Äôs a platform to build our lives with a financial freedom !!! THIS IS THE FOUNDATION ! LIKE PAINKILLERS SO u can have the courage to do the rest of treatment urself and get better !!! It‚Äôs a part of cure NOT THE WHOLE CURE !
#####
Haha ! When GOVERNMENT USED 4 TRILLION DOLLARS TO BAIL OUT BANKS IN 2008 crisis , DID ANYONE OBJECT ???? Nah government didn‚Äôt care , and MONEY WAS TAKEM FROM PEOPLE and given to banks who caused the crash ! THIS TIME WE ARE CHOOSING PEOPLE ! Money to PEOPLE !!! And it‚Äôs OUR money , not a charity , handout , OUR SHARE !!! OUR RIGHT !!! Suddenly if someone says to give money directly to people MEDIA like these cry wolf coz IF PEOPLE GET MONEY POLITICIANS WONT BE ABLE TO TAKE PROFITS !!!
#####

The poor will be affected by vat? 

No, only those who can spend more than 10k a month will be affected by VAT, and I am very sure if you can spend that kind of money, you are not in the category of "poor".

Just go to sleep, NBC

Yang is a genius and shame on the media and MSNBC in particular for ignoring yang and not treating him seriously. Yang‚Äôs UBI plan would make the entire world a better place.
#####
when nbc realizes they made a mistake not covering but doesnt know how big a mistake that was
#####
The bigger uneducated part of U.S Voters need clarification that ‚ÄúUniversal basic income for every adult over 18‚Äù, is for United States Citizens so they wont throw his whole argument out the window
#####
"Most economists agree a VAT would hit the poor the hardest" is simply not true. The only possible way that would be true is if it was just a flat VAT on everything which is not what Yang wants or what other countries have. Either they are pushing their agenda or incompetent
#####
Please do yourself a favor and look into this guy‚Äôs policies! He has a plan and wants to fix things. #Yang2020
#####
We pay GST 10% tax on items except foods and necessities. I was sceptical. It works. And  the 1k we got during the 2008 crash floated the economy. We didn't go under when nearly EVERYONE else did. Imagine if it were monthly. The economy would boom, you become loyal and want to support brands producing in your country to support your economy. It inspires you a responsibility in you to try to help small business and local companies. It works psychologically and economically.
#####
Why is NBC providing misinformation again? ‚ÄúMost economist‚Äù? How did they come to that conclusion? UBI will help countless individuals and humanity as a whole. Yang for president!

A UBI will give everyone a $6 raise. Hitting ABOVE $15 when combined with the minimum in most states. With this type if economic stimulation, it'd be much easier to then pay a federal minimum of $15 per hour. On Top of that, A UBI will go with you as you grow, train for better jobs, as you advance your career. IT GOES WITH YOU. A group of people can create a business. The local communities will get a DIRECT economic boost. #YangGang

@3:30 she told a blatant lie. She says America has never attempted a UBI. False. It passed twice in congress under frwaking Nixon. NBC hold this ‚ÄúL‚Äù.
#####
Worst opinion piece ever.
#####
So you're telling me people could still keep their welfare? Get 1000$? No need to work? 
Oh wait i forget selling food stamps for cash is job too
This is how it will be in real life Mr. Yang 
Im all for your idea i just think you need to eliminate one for the other.
#####
This is why Trump will win 2020. You even do faked news on your own party.
#####
@ 3:24 you say that a nationwide UBI program has never been attempted in America, but you fail to mention that the Nixon era House of Reps passed a nationwide plan not once, but twice. There have been attempts.

Please explain to me how a 10% tax on goods with clothes and groceries totally exempt and paired with a $1000/m tax-free monthly check hits the poor the hardest? Americans, please be smarter than MSM believes you to be and don‚Äôt fall for this nonsense. Of course it hits the highest spenders, AKA the rich, the hardest (and Yang has said luxury goods wealthy people buy could be targeted for higher than 10% VAT), while helping the poorest the most.

Let‚Äôs vote #Yang2020 and make this happen!

"Andrew Yang creams in guys mouth".

 It wouldn't be a misleading headline... Because, he is a "Full Service Candidate".

Yeah, this is not in reference to porn ...

This is beyond embarrassing. I believe these people are mentally ill.

All of this could have been articulated without exploiting his own children. THIS is what stop supporting Yang.
#####
Beautiful family, great ideas for our country. I can't wait to see the Yangs move into the white house
#####
I support Andrew Yang, but this ad suck.  This ad look too clean and artificial.  If I didn't know who is Andrew Yang and see this, I would think its just another politician running for local government.  Show us something like that CNN report with Evelyn Yang.  Give us the human side of his campaign.
#####
I like Yang a lot, but he's not for Medicare for All in any way shape or form. He really needs to revise his copy moving forward. Medicare for all is a specific bill and he's not in support of it. Very misleading and disingenuous.
#####
Bernie and Yang supporters unite!
#####
I can't believe I'm watching ads in 2019 and nobody is tricking me into it. Wow!

This is the only time I'm really proud of the Asian stereotype of being good in math and Mr. Yang is slaying this statistics game. Please vote for him, dear Americans. He can solve your scary math problems. He can lead the world into an elevated existence ‚ú® he can usher our generation to finally live more dignified lives.
#####
The only candidate I would vote for in the primaries.
#####
"Universal Basic Income recipients might lose other benefits
To receive UBI, citizens would have to choose between the $1,000 or any existing welfare benefits--potentially including Social Security, disability insurance, food stamps, and housing assistance. It's unclear whether Yang's UBI would be worth that trade-off for many low-income families. Yang's press secretary could not provide a "full list of programs.but health care is definitely not considered part of someone's current benefits when talking about the Freedom Dividend."


so if youre a low income person, a  struggling senior or a disabled person  you trade thousands...possibly tens of thousands... of benefits for 12000 a year. And the 12000 per year is given to people who dont NEED it, PLUS..he wants an VAT on everything. Chew on that for awhile.
#####
I thought Andrew's wife wanted absolutely nothing to do with American Politics.
#####
We need yang! He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history
#####
Yang could start a dynasty like the bushes.
#####
Good promises start from compassion.
#####
What a Beautiful family!
#####
the shimmys, are swaying slowly to the Yang Gang. :p
#####
Special needs should come under a seperate scheme. Like Australia has done with the separation of Medicare and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There‚Äôs a difference between one off treatments for medical issues and life long care for those living with a permanent disability
#####
Andrew Yang is truly the man. Do American voters understand what he's trying to do? They need to ... for the sake of their country.
#####
I think people like you should pay for it why should big companies like amazon do it, that‚Äôs ruthless and against the American dream people build companies not so they can pay more taxes for people like me I hate paying taxes to keep criminals fed and I do not agree with this free health care approach
#####
Andrew Yang: "This is NOT just my idea. From Thomas Paine to Martin Luthor King, Universal Basic Income has been the baton that others have been wanting to pass along in this marathon of human progress. And I want to be the one that takes it to the finish line."
#####
A.Yang is a racist ignorant dude. Anchor baby does not sit well with Americans.

I have a mentally ill mother and our family is practically poor just because of the medical bills, I approve of Andrew yang! ‚ù§Ô∏è

#####
Jeff Bezos created 32 yt accounts to dislike this

He would be a perfect Vice President. A ticket with Sanders.
#####
I like Andrew Yang but correct me if i'm wrong isn't his "medicare 4 all" plan basically a public option? That means that those who don't want to be a part of it- can opt out. So why would Amazon pay for Health Care?
#####
I love this my only feedback , 'When my husband Andrew Yang is president' the camera should have focused on him a little bit longer to get that face recognition out there....it went by so fast. Other than that this is awesome!
#####
But he's not for M4A, he's for a public option/ buy-in.
#####
I can't remember the last time a politician is willing to bring up mental illness to the spotlight.

#####
Andrew, can you help Hong Kong please?
#####
Dear Mr. Yang: one of your supporters responded to my tweet about how your basic income would cause hyperinflation by calling me mentally ill and suggesting I get counseling.  I bet if your wife demanded you not allow your supporters to engage your non-supporters this way, you'd put a stop to it.  This was done in your name.  Please be advised I have attorneys who handle bad internet behavior directed towards me, and won't hesiste to explore any and all legal options against anyone who defames me online (and harasses me) the way your supporter did.  Please teach your fans some manners.

Except kids and young parents will have to wait years for the age elegibility to welcome them...

Untill then...

Nothing changes for them...

Also, still waiting for details on premiums and copays that may very well mirror what employees currently contribute to their employer subsidised plan in an effort to protect for proffit insurance companies and union plans, keep young healthy clients while Medicare4All gets saddled with the older, poorer and aflicted clients...

Tulsi's Medicare4All+ is the way to go because it requires all to participate in Medicare4All but allows those with the resources to gold plate with private plans if they so choose...

Medicare4All should be like public school... You pay for it whether you choose to use it or not...

Andrew Yang's Medicare4All isn't actually for all...

Nor is it paid for with taxes...

And is designed to fail in an effort to protect for proffit insurance companies and union plans...
#####
Medicare for all...defined as I, Andrew Yang, defines it...NOT impressed, as a campaign donor I am not impressed to waste money on dishonest ads.

Aww man I liked the other ad a lot more, it set Andrew apart from the crowd. Then again everyone already knows about the UBI so why not air this one, I can see the logic, but still.

As a yangster I will admit the last part of the video was kinda cringey

There's a reason why everyone loves this guy.

Andrew Yang i will stand in front of a firing squad for you. because i know i will die a hero and i will know my death will save millions of lives. if my miserable sorry life was enough for everyone to live with dignity i would throw myself off of a skyscrapers roof right now. thank you Andrew yang your ideas gave me purpose in my life, and a goal i would never give up on. im not american but i promise you i will make my work on my country as hard as this man did. my country is Egypt and regardless this policy should be worldwide. if this man can unite the world he can sure as hell unite america god bless this man.

I support Yang but it's not presidential or fair to single out a company like this, Amazon is the best example but I think the point can be made with more grace

"Including Mental Health Coverage" Yay!!! Oh so important! Thank you Yang!

Soooo who‚Äôs going to pay for this Medicare for all? Where‚Äôs the money coming from?? Who determines how much will be allotted to each individual or household??? How much more national debt will it create for America???? Will my personal income tax rate increase (obviously it will) and when it does how much more will I be paying to help others who are unable to help themselves?????

Socialism- YOU make it, THEY take it....and give it to a loser junkie who refuses to work or be a productive member in society while stuffing their corrupt little politician hands with your hard earned money and way overspend on incompetent, inefficient, and wasteful government systems and bureaucracies that do not work for you.

I‚Äôm a big fan of Yang, but I did not think this was a good ad. He‚Äôs not being clear about his Medicare stance, and he‚Äôs now doubling down on the VA tax to pay for his proposals, which adds to the one trick pony dynamic. Yang has stronger ads than this
#####
You have convinced alot of us republicans to give you a chance.i was really excited about your family heart warming message. It turned way to fast to calling out Amazon and demanding others to start paying for other people's stuff. That's not how you talk in interviews. You don't sound like the typical Democrat. This add does not flow well with you trying to reach out to people of all backgrounds.
Please brainstorm your adds to sound more data driven and humble approach like your interviews so you can convince the rest of my conservative friends to give yah a chance.
#####
I'm going to ruin the 222 comments.  :(  Sorry, I'm number 223.  :D
For the algorithm!
#####
Love watching your interviews with Ben Shapiro, and Joe Rogan. We have spent alot of time researching your campaign and have slowly been making the switch to go for you instead of republican. This campaign add was not well done. It looked like it was about to be  A heart warming emotional ad and get us feeling deep emotions, but the ad ended with a different vibe and did not flow well!!! The reason people are loving you is because of your knowledge and heart. Not because of you condemning Amazon and saying your going to force other people to pay to take care of others.
Most conservatives don't understand your plan for Medicare for all or how you want to do it. So when you come out so blunt like that they view it as another tax hungry economy ruiner Democrat.
But your not so don't talk or use the same lingo as them.

Your interviews are so heart felt and down to earth this was not.
Please find your spark again .

Us educators know that a change is needed and we beleive you have alot of the solutions.
#####
I Honestly already see Evelyn Yang as the First Lady ! She's genuine, real, and has the poise of First Lady ! Like Michelle Obama ! Yang2020 !
#####
Short targeted example ads are a good idea üëç. Including another voice that has experienced that example, then you relating your policy to it is a home run. üôå
#####
NOTICE. He says "COMPANIES" not frothing at the mouth billionares billionares billionares.. its not Jeff Bezos the man its his bohemoth of a company and its been working within the system but the government has to intervene in some way sinply because its not sustainable. Money is the root of all our infrastructure and bigs players will only get bigger. Andrew Yang understands more than these 70 year olds the future of the "game" so please educate your friends and family unless you want to go back in time in America. And we are actually not like that. I believe Americans north south east and west and in between can get it.

Im a Yanger but this ad is all wrong. You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúmy son is autistic so Amazon has to pay for it.‚Äù  It should of focus on how Amazon is destroying jobs and local businesses without paying any taxes, and how we should use a VAT tax to bring money back to the people, not bureaucracy.

Jeff Bezos prolly so damn genius that he'd wake up the next morning, make another $100 Billion, and end with a cigar knowing he'd paid the freedom dividend in full the day before.
#####
Beside all the big meetings with croweds in different cities, we need to inveast on increasing the voluenteering grassroot workers  in each cities and show them the paths to regularly produce videos on different themes of revolutionary ideas that Andrew Yang has... Students are best platforms for volunteers... there is nothing more important than volunteering spirit...
I believe these adds are good for Television but it is simple and old stuffs for the internet... Grassrooters with Internet can work like a bom for Andrew.  
Eagles love battle and victory...
#####
I can't imagine but it is not the Federal government's responsibility to care for your child or anyone else's. Local communities used to do these things u till the Federal government demonized them. Just look at Beto who dropped out and was targeting churches and after he dropped out targeted the American flag. Keep the Federal government small and respect local and state governments to deal with these things. Andrew Yang,  I was respecting you but between this and UBI you lost me.
#####
I got chills right away. Jeez

Yang is a national treasure .

I agree in a few things but... Vote at age 16!? Lol no thanks!
#####
I'm confused.  R u proposing to give every US citizen 1000 dollars per month or give everyone here 1000 a month.  There are many watching around the world for this specific question.
#####
Why is all the text in spanish? Isn't that unfair to other immigrants who don't speak it?
#####
First time I hear about lowering the age the vote, makes so much sense!
#####
I agree with YANG 100%
#####

#####
This is the first time I've seen Yang caught off guard - clearly not prepared for the questions - and he stepped up like a real trooper.
#####
And the Latinos/Hispanics are not interested in "el chinito" to be "el presidente" de EE.UU.
#####
Why should "We, the People" bypass the next white woman for president?  What America wanted to see was a "black president", "billionaire president" after Ross Perot's attempt, and now 2020, what America really wants is a woman for the US presidency after Hillary was debunked in 2016.  Americans want to be entertained like Hollywood's The Gladiator.  And it was their dream to see what it was like to have a "black president", and to rectify the conservative right wing's regret and "buyer's remorse" by having a billionaire try to fix whatever they thought was broken.  And now the majority of America wants to be entertained again to see a woman for the role of POTUS.
#####
So true, when I think of FB, I cringe because it's like for people with income of zero.  It's a perception of course and not necessarily true.  Go YangGang!
#####
Americans must see Yang as their president! üëç
#####
My biggest thing with the freedom dividend is, does he really think the US government is capable of allocating 1k a month or 12k a year per citizen for over 300 million people efficiently? The issues with food stamps and any .gov agency is a running joke in this country. But i guess a tech entrepenuer is the one guy/girl that would be suited for making a government database run smoother.
#####
Complete Fantasy Destroyer - Andrew Yang
#####
A "technology dividend"....like Alaska's "oil dividend". Make sense to me!!
#####
The democratic party does not like white males?? Yang is the only guy representing the democratic party who is NOT white, and gay!!
#####
So it's not seeming to work right away, but I changed my pic to Andrew Yang, and it still shows my old pic on the comments when I look back... Lame, but totally change your pic to Andrew. Andrew's internet army lol.
#####
Yassss!!!
#####
Let's all here make sure that we spread Yang's proposals to at least 5 people who we believe should be exposed to them and that may not be yet. Give a like to this comment if you are up to the challenge!
#####
Hispanics despierta. Yang 2020!
#####
M.A.T.H.
#####
Seriously the best candidate out there
#####
They need to merge NOW - YANG, Bernie, & Tulsi. Declare themselves as a triumvirate and pool their supporters and STEAMROLL OVER THE DNC.   No more following the playbook which the DNC will surely cheat once again to stop a progressive nomination. DNC chairman Tom Perez is certain to be plotting their demise - make no mistake about it.
#####
He doesn't pander to audiences - he talks facts and proposals / solutions that resonates with all people.  This guy has a SHOT at the presidency. The polls are skewed and manipulated.
#####
YANG BERNIE TULSI - BERNIE YANG TULSI - TULSI YANG BERNIE - ALL 3 ARE ON POINT AND CAN CHANGE AMERICA FOR THE BETTER....!!
#####
I love how it's "Ang2020". That just makes me think of ATLA... omg he's the one that saves USA. OUR AANG.
#####
Andrew Yang, I have been thinking about your freedom dividend and I have a question.  Given the divide between the two parties, how do you plan on gaining their support?  If you are unable to gain their support, how then will you implement the freedom dividend?  Also if you are able to implement all of your policies,  have you considered the possible backlash of increased cost of living like rent being raised by landlords or the cost of goods?  Would that not negate the intended purpose of the freedom dividend?  (In other words inflation)
#####

i like yang but i think lowering the voting age is absolutely insane.
#####
I love listening to Yang
#####
The only threat to Trump is Andrew Yang but the DNC and their Propaganda unit The Fake News Media have already chosen Sleepy Joe. Its a rigged system folks
#####
Yang for Latinos
#####
I like all his policies - except for those on social media and young people which are too conservative and regulatory  (I am 17 yrs old he is representative of the traditionalist anti youth social media establishment) the stats for depression or correlationary not caused BIG difference no one I know is depressed bc of social media it makes most young people very happy exam stress probably causes far more stress

Social media and the internet hypnotize more than children and teens. They all, including YouTube, present opportunities to be ugly, abrasive, and cruel in one's anonymity. Capable of bringing out the best in humans, instead it brings out the worst in greater volume.
#####
Its really starting to freaking piss me off something fierce where every time the UBI 1k a month is brought up, nobody brings up that the people on poor welfare programs like TANF, EBT FOOD STAMPS AND SSI DISABILITY has to give up all of that help and assistance in order to get JUST 1K UBI. Yangs policy of UBI screws those people over and will not allow them to stack the UBI along with their current income and help programs. He needs to stop lying that EVERYONE GETS 1k UBI no questions asked and no strings attached. Putting restrictions only on SSI and poor welfare people making them give up benefits for benefits is complete discrimination of treating only them different while allowing every worker no matter how much they make and any rich person to get a free 1k UBI a month no restrictions and they are allowed to stack it with their current income. Wtf is this country huh? Always trying to fuc* over the poor to spoil the rich every chance they get? Until he fixes that stupid bullsh*t he will not get my vote. Thats grounds for suing if I ever seen it. Restrictions on getting UBI as extra should be on the wealthy people that sure as hell don‚Äôt need it and poor people need it as EXTRA on top of their current help and income. Thats bullsh*t to only put restrictions on poor people. How the hell is that fair to them huh? How is it EXTRA to them huh? Its not cause all their left with is 1k UBI that has to replace the income they take away from them in order to get it while nobody else has to lose income to get it as extra a month. Screw UBI! Its only to spoil everyone else off the backs of the poor and disabled taking the hit AS ALWAYS WITH CAPITALISM.
#####
I have an idea. Why don't you do an experiment and ask to be paid $15 an hour. Let us know after Fed, State, SS, FICA and your benefits comes out of your patycheck, how you are living. I know people making $15 an hour also working a 2nd and 3rd job to make it. I was blessed with a job making $22 an hour and I bring home less than $700. Imagine what $15 an hour brings home then. UBI will help all including caretakers of family members and all those on disability who have worked hard in factories or nurses and truck drivers whose bodies have been worn down from all that hard work. Last but definitely not least, these veterans who have totally been forgotten about.
#####
Yang Gang!!!
#####
Andrew Yang is really the opposite of the Donald 
When Trump speaks, it feels like a surreal nightmare and I wanna wake up but I'm stuck laughing about it with nutso late night comics 
Sometimes when Yang speaks, i get the weirdest feeling like, "is this real life right now?"
We don't deserve him
I worry that I'm gonna wake up from a nice dream
#####
Did he say "Alaskans earn $1000 to $2000 a year"? That's nothing...it won't help anymore than a tax return, which doesn't bring us out of poverty.
#####
Science shows the brain is not fully developed, and the human is not set in their ways, until they're young adults....so let's not rush to get immature teens into the decision making process.

BERNIE AND YANG.   I LIKE IT!!!

I have been watching Andrew Yang for sometimes. I find, he is an extremely intelligent and kind who is able to put humanity first.¬†He will bring unity, not the division.¬†He will bring new reality in the entire world.  Vote for this precious man, USA. ¬†from Canada.
#####
The way he answered is fucking amazing
#####
I have a question: How to prevent the freedom dividend of 1k a month from going back into buying drugs, guns and the bad things that plague society? The sudden financial aid can't replace good intrinsic value that those badniks oughta have
#####
ATTEN: LATINOS!! Votan por el chino !!! El es de la raza !!! Votan por YANG 2020
#####
I don't want facebook twitter youtube or google being an editorial middle man deciding based on their view what is political what I can or can't see or share. Some of this is their function as platforms as search but much of the function is the backbone road for communication and that must have the nature of a common carrier indifferent to the content. I'm a little to offended by COPPA at the moment.
#####
It is so refreshing and motivating to hear some intelligent conversation. These are very capable and courageous men speaking hear. Humanity first.  I support Yang for 2020
#####
Yang‚Äôs mission aside from humanity first and moving us along into the 4th industrial revolution is educating politicians on relevance. He even offered a copy of his books to them during the December debate. He‚Äôs is not mean spirited at all and I like that to be embodied for the new presidency.
#####
Money is power. I know UBI would not cause much inflation but even if the purchasing power of that $1k became only $500, that's still a game changer for so many people. Even only $100 - $300 would be amazing.
#####
Andrew Young is the solution to America problem.
#####
Do yourself a favor America, vote Yang 2020 and continue to be the great beacon the world sees you as!! Donate! Donate! Donate and poll poll poll!!

Yang is the only candidate that has a plan to tackle the ACTUAL challenges of the future, which is jobb loss through automatization, AND can beat Trump in the finals, cuz lots of Trump voters right now say "I voted for Trump, but I would vote for Yang in the finals"!

Fudging the UBI here in front of Latinos. It's not $1k/mo 'for everyone in the country', rather for citizens. Speak straight Andy. You're behaving like a politician here. Go Yang Gang!
#####
Great Interview!
#####
He stood up when the lady on crutches asked a question standing up. What a gentleman and a scholar.
#####
wait...so 1000 dollars is going to help farmers...how exactly?
i wish he would be more honest and say. ''hell if i know", rather than pander to the broke college students in the back.
also curious how he assumes, that the immigrants working the fields are illegals, lol. nice yang, nice.
#####
Yang I hope you rerun for president in 2024, if you don't beat Turnip that is
#####
Idk about age 16 voters...
#####
Thank God for Andrew Yang!

Answered every question like a Boss, very direct and didn‚Äôt mess around.
#####
ANDREW YANG FOR PRESIDENT. 2020.  UBI (1000 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR LIFE FOR ALL AMERICANS 18YEARS OLD).  LET THE CONGRESSMAN THAT GET MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS FOR THEIR FOUNDATION BE NO MORE.  USE LOBBYISTS MONEY FOR UBI.
#####
Andrew Yang must team up with youtubers, he will get more public recognition through them especially through the youth!!
#####
The only website that has worked for me personally and gives away instagram followers for free is SMM EMPIRE - Take my word for it, But for real I tested many other websites too however none of those really work like SMM EMPIRE haha
#####
Everything is pretty much imported here from China, Yang was born here in NY, parents are from Taiwan, not China. Most American-made candidates are faulty like the one in the Oval office, Yang has my vote.
#####
Some great questions!!
#####
Um illegals can't vote so they will be denied  forever
#####
And stop Banning GOP ads
#####
UBI is pie in the sky. All Americans have to be given the opportunity to go to college, university or trade schools tuition free. All student debt has to be eliminated. Every American has the right to health care - Medicare for All. We have to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, we need a federal jobs guarantee and an increase of the minimum wage to a living wage. I‚Äôm a progressive but I hold no truck with anyone sitting on their ass to get 1k a month, that is not the way forward. The way forward is.... we eat the rich, they‚Äôve had it all their way for far to long, it‚Äôs time they contribute to the wellbeing of working class Americans.

Where are the big celebrity endorsements? We need Obama, Oprah, and Ellen.
#####
Bernie's minions are so brainwashed that they can't see outside of the box. They remind me of these communist youth who would regurgitate the Marxist mantra even in the face of proven facts. When you have an almost dead uncle who can't navigate his iPhone, do you think he understands the challenges of the 21st-century economy with AI/automation and robots? I fully agree with his solutions but they are tailored for the last century's economy, not this new one. Go Yang!

Amazing ads! I would someday love to see the team that make these videos

There‚Äôs literally no political ad that‚Äôs ever made me cry before.

May God bless Andrew Yang & family. It is imperative for president to have vision and integrity than experience. Washington D.C. has more than enough experts in such about any area to implement the President's decision.  Have we seen enough the last three years?

We do have a choice. A sustainable choice. 

There are 327 million people living in America.¬† Of those, 16% have an IQ of 85 or less.¬† 

Thats around 52 million people who can look forward to a career as Unskilled laborer, Gardener, Janitor, Maid or a Dishwasher.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2012, approximately 52.2 million people used government assistance of some kind. The most used programs were SNAP and Medicaid.

Coincide?

This may come as a shock to you but an estimated 45.3% of American households ‚Äî roughly 77.5 million ‚Äî will pay no federal individual income tax.¬† ZERO

So if they dont pay any taxes but still use all the services, how does that make them a shareholder?

The number of people relying on assistance programs has grown since then. More than¬†42 million people used food stamps in 2017 and more than 67 million people were on Medicaid in May of 2018.

What we need is a positive eugenics program, not handouts.

The mean IQ world wide is 90 and falling due to wide spread dysgenics.¬† 

Here in the United States the mean IQ was 100 at the turn of the century, but is now 98 and falling due to unchecked low IQ immigration.

As a rule of thumb. Every person under 95 IQ is six times as costly as the productivity of every person over 105 IQ.

IQ affects employability.

60 to 74¬† "Slow, simple, supervised."
74 to 89¬† food service
89 to 100 Walmart
100 to 111 Police officer
111 to 120 Teacher
120 to 125 Professor
125 to 132 Attorney
132 to 137 Eminent professor
137 to 200 No limitations. 

Therefore the most benefit that any person can provide is actually not through education or employment but by not contributing to the reproduction of the underclasses. Those with an IQ below 105.

If your IQ is below 105.¬† Do the world a favour and do not have children.
#####
Yang definitely doesn‚Äôt have my vote. He‚Äôs an idiot and never has any idea on what he‚Äôs talking about. Legalizing cocaine and prostitution would be a lot better than UBI, which would be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.
#####
When companies get liquadated jobs are moved overseas the workers get fd and the bankers get rich. End Wall Street liquadation now
#####
He's offering nothing but poverty to the retired in a disabled, he sounds like my little millennial nephew, oh social security Medicare free sorry Andrew I paid into those they're my they're not free they're not a giveaway

God, bless this man.

Literally, 2 stores near me just introduce Kiosk in the past month.

Oh man this is a really great ad, this better air in ALL THE STATES!!
#####
Andrew! I may not be popular with some people on the left. Just as I'm sure I'm not popular by some people on the right. But that is because our country is devided and polerised for too long. But the majority of the people stand in the middle and we need a man in the middle to bring the people back together. Andrew Yang for president 2020
#####
Excellent. Please get this everywhere. When you get closing statements during the debate, ask them to pull up this ad and just play it. The visuals with the voice over really get the point across in the kind of full media experience most Americans are used to these days. The debates as they are right now are really throw backs to when things were on radios, there's barely anything visually engaging or interesting!

This, on the other hand, marvelous!
#####
This ad is much better

this one was good!! Yang is getting all serious and politician-y but i love it

I like it! It is only 30 seconds long, but it really would make your head turn if you weren't paying attention to the tv. Then it says stuff about Universal Basic income and ending living paycheck to paycheck. This may not be a lot of information, but certainly enough to make people goog Andrew Yang
#####
Yang you need to spam the hell outta this ad
#####
Secure that mf bag
#####
Apparently, a slogan is all it takes to convince a gullible crowd to accept as a gift what has been stolen from it in taxes. This comment section truly is face-palm worthy.
#####
Another lame ad. Missed oppurtunity by Yang. They could have done so much better.
#####
I feel like I'm preparing to watch The Amazing Race
#####
When i heard about yang i am so sure he's going to win i spent half my 3 year savings on non of your business. That's my favorite kind of business I've been running it for several years. Do you know how long it took me to save that money?. I bet yang can do the math. Who has the data? yang does.üòú

I really did so i hope he wins
#####
I'm pretty conservative, but I'm voting for Andrew Yang! UBI, automation, Medicare for all, ending money in politics all policies I could get behind. (In fact, Yang convinced me where I was skeptical. )
#####
*PROJECT FREE SPEECH* Vote against all sitting Presidents. Until we get on who limits internet bans to 10 days.

sounds like they upt his voice a tiny bit.

Theres a lot you can do with an extra $12,000 a year. Yang2020!
#####
Great ad! Play Sam Bee‚Äôs primary voting game app to help Andrew raise more money!
#####
Yes
#####
It‚Äôs all futile demagogueries with free money bribery and automations fear mongering.

UBI is also laced with blatant racism and hypothetical discrimination.
#####
What is the maximum length of internet ban that Andrew supports?
#####
Love the automation in the beginning, it should help open the eyes of those who isn't aware of AI and its capability yet.
#####
*Traitor Pete* supports endless war and internet bans. What are you doing about that, Andrew?
#####
So glad I saw this instead of the same Bernie ad for the 1000th time

He has my vote and my donation it's time to make America United

Fun facts:

He will addict America to free money that will bankrupt America via hyperinflation, after everyone is dependent on the free money.¬† Bitcoin will become the national currency and you can't inflate that.
#####
Yang looks like MLK in that last shot.  Nice!
#####
What a lovely lovely voice
#####
Dear Mr. Yang: one of your supporters responded to my tweet about how your basic income would cause hyperinflation by calling me mentally ill and suggesting I get counseling.  I bet if your wife demanded you not allow your supporters to engage your non-supporters this way, you'd put a stop to it.  This was done in your name.  Please be advised I have attorneys who handle bad internet behavior directed towards me, and won't hesiste to explore any and all legal options against anyone who defames me online (and harasses me) the way your supporter did.  Please teach your fans some manners.
#####

It baffles me that he‚Äôs not the front runner rn. This man is a once-in-ten-lifetimes leader and we‚Äôre about to nominate the Mayor of South Bend...

He will replace the disappeared jobs (av. salary $44,000 p.a.) with $12,000. So progressive.

#####
Ooooh yeah I really like this one!
#####
My wife accompanied one of her staff members who was having stomach pains to a doctor's clinic. When she came back just a while ago, she was visibly distressed. 
    She narrated to me that while she was sitting in the clinic lounge, she struck a conversation with an elderly couple who were sitting near her. 
     It turned out that the man suddenly felt dizzy earlier and was brought to the clinic by their son. 
   .  After getting treatment, the husband felt better. They were billed just 80 dollars. 
       My wife said she thought that they were just resting for a while more before heading home. 
         After about an hour later, the couple's son returned and handed his mom some money. 
     My wife heard the son's mom said they were still 30 dollars short but the son said that was all he could come up with.  So, what my wife did was she gave them 50 dollars. They wouldn't accept it at first but she insisted until they finally took it and paid their bills, afterwhich they left. 
       My wife's story made us  realize more clearly what Andrew Yang's 1k UBI would mean to a lot of people. 
      Yang 2020.
#####
Yangs biggest weakness is that he doesn't mention his other great policies and focuses mainly on ubi.
#####
I really wish he would call it the FREEDOM DIVIDEND in the video instead of just UBI. It just sounds way more badass. Missed opportunity IMO!!!!
#####
Stop that movie theater IOWA as and show this instead Andrew!
#####
The ad is realistic and very relatable. This is why I believe it will make more people to start paying attention to Yang.
 
If only you know how many people pray daily never to have an emergency $500 bill because it will simply ruin the whole month for their family!

The reason why you see most people cry extra hard when they have an emergency bill of say $500 is simply the inability to answer the simple question of how do I pay for this? How will I survive this month?  How will my kids get by! 

It's a shame but it's the reality!

You don't need to blame those who criticize or try to discredit Yang ideas especially the UBI..

When the bill is due,  the fridge is empty, the kids are hungry, there's no gas in the car and your wallet is empty.. 

Or when ur house is foreclosed and you live on the street with no idea when u'll  get ur next meal.. 

Or when you are a single mom  / dad and your boss kept tormenting you yet you can't afford to leave the job because bills ain't gonna pay itself.. 

Or when you are in an abusive relationship with total reliance on your abusive partner and bleak means of standing alone.. 

Or when you are differently able but had to constantly endure emotional turmoil and so much needs your freedom...

Or when you have a job that barely covers living cost and student loan keeps nagging you nonstop.. 

Or when you want to start a home biz or a little gig but needs a little bucks to bankroll it.. 

Or when after clearing all bills and waiting for next paycheck your car suddenly go haywire and you need to get to work and attend to other errands..

Or when you are an Ex-con and no one will give you a benefit of doubt to start over.. 

Or a veteran, truck driver, etc feeling used and dumped with no clear prospect to forge ahead.. 

Etc etc etc... 

You will probably understand why a little push like the $1000 monthly freedom dividend matters in so many different ways to so many Americans!

NB: Sincerely, I think Americans are lucky to have a passionate leader like Mr Andrew Yang..  I wish it won't be  too late before you guys will realize this!
#####
*Andrew* will you begin to properly refer to the Mayor as *Traitor Pete* He Supports Permanent internet bans

AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, I TRUSTED WITH MY LIFE IN SUPPORTING OUR 46TH PRESIDENT: ANDREW YANG.

Coming from a Trump supporter, I really hope Yang wins primaries. If Trump loses, I'd feel comfortable knowing the presidency would be in Yang's hands.

#####
I love Andrew Yang and I am totaly yanggang but I wish he would google climate gate. 

He still ist with distance the ultimative best candidate but this one here is crap. :-)
#####
I can't help feeling you are trying to buy our votes$$$$, just where is that money proposed to pay everyone $1000 a month, when they don't even have the money to pay people their Social security when they are retired, it's Already spent on some wall, or war conflict somewhere, that the American People Did Not Want or Vote for, your campaign is just trying to lure the poorest of the poor, most of whom would rather pick up a check from the government than work Anyway
#####
Andrew Yang, yes our climate Is Changing, Mother Earth does that, look at ice core samples, every 36,000 years we go through another Yuga in earth calendar, we Are actually coming into a mini ice age, but FIRST the oceans heat up, then ice melts cooling the oceans down, changing the weather on the planet,  it's a way mother earth regenerates, just like droughts and fires, they help regenerate too, yes corporations could clean up their act. What we are going through is a natural process, the earth IS far older than humanity,

Except ethanol gas that industry is good.
#####
A question I have for Andrew Yang or his staffers so I can be more informed.  I think and hope he has a great chance in 2020.  Here is my question; how will Andrew Yang prevent the $1000 stipend from being sent out of the country by citizens trying to help less fortunate family members in poverty stricken countries?  Isnt that partly why trickle down economics didnt work?  Will it devalue the dollar and hurt the economy if it's not reinvested in our country?

Lastly, I just read that Andrew Yang hired Donald Glover as a creative assistant.  While Donald Glover is extremely talented, he is also known in the music industry as Childish Gambino, and his lyrics are abusive toward women, and can come across as racist.  As I said, very talented person, just in the world of politics and voters (as to his judgement)...not a good look.

I would like to give my support to Andrew Yang as I feel he cares about our nation and it's people.  He has a real feel, and will be a great and presidential leader that can heel a nation torn.
#####
My opinion doesn't matter but if Andrew yang needed me go to war he's the only candidate for president in my lifetime that I would feel comfortable doing so for

Leaving a comment for the algorithm
#####
I'd like to believe he is serious about climate.  Of course for this to be valid, it would mean an end to farm subsidies that directly support the animal farmed industry.  The largest treat to our environment is what's our your plate!  Raising animals in mass for food is grossly inefficient, it's depleting our drinking water, the waste run-off is positioning our rivers, lakes and oceans and the high fat content is creating an obesity and catastrophic health epidemic. By all mean, yes - lets get to the root cause of the problem!
#####
Yang has great ideas on issues that are plaguing us--especially technology.  His humanitarian values are reflected in his policy proposals.  We are letting tech happen, but we are failing to direct it.  Scary stuff will happen if we continue with this lack of focus.  He's the man to lead us through this revolution into a new age.  I really like him and his ideas.

idiots thinks lowering CO2 would save the planet but in fact, it will kill all the plants... then the next crisis will be food shortages and the next candidate will promise to fix food shortages.   The same people creating the problems offering you the solution and all the idiots will vote for them.  it should be illegal for idiots to vote, they are so dumb will believe anything without any thought.

never elect someone who claims to save the planet. Such bullshit message. stick to math mr.yang

Climate change is a very divisive topic. Who can actually change the course of nature? I think it's better to focus on environmental degradation... it's the label that stinks. Someone has to change that confusing "climate change" label because as it stands, "climate change" seems more like a globalist propaganda like "denuclearization"...it's a way to control weaker economies and take advantage of them, and to sell "environment-friendly" technologies to the less informed. I don't agree with this "climate change" label but I agree to holding entities responsible for polluting the environment.

I wish Yang could talk more about policies in detail. It's so frustrating to have to always be referred to his website. Less sound-bites more real talk. Curious to hear how he will pitch his Medicare plan in the December debates. He's got to get people talking about him by talking about that as well.
#####
damn.. the title of this video REALLY had me thinking yang was about to drop a song

This is just one of Yang's list of comprehensive policies to actually improve America and prepare us for the short term and long term effects of this new millenium.
#####
I've said this a thousand times, but I'm gonna say it again.  It's smart as hell how Yang was playing political chess this whole time, laying back while other candidates weakened each other and fell outta the way, andd Yang kept rising slowly in the background.  But now he's top 5 and only the front-runners are left.  IT'S TIME TO UPSHIFT.

Yang, you gotta come out swinging in the next debate.  Dominate the conversation with substance, force the debate you want to have, challenge the front-runners on their data.  Show why their ideas aren't effective enough and why your platforms are superior.  Grab the spotlight, grab the speaking time, grab the mic.


YOU NEED TO PICK A FIGHT.  Not a personal one necessarily, but definitely a policy one.  You have to CONTRAST yourself and show why you are the One.  There's not much time left to break into the top-tier.  If you don't cause a stir that has the MSM talking heads focused on you one way or another after this debate, I don't know how many opportunities there will be left.  IT'S NOW OR NEVER.
#####
Andrew mf Yang ...our next POTUS
#####
Wait why does this sound so similar to Teddy idea xD ? If he ain‚Äôt nominated we basically lost a modern Theodore Roosevelt

Climate crisis is natural disasters, it has nothing to do with fossil fuels and economic geology mining Industry and pollution and deforestation.  Everywhere was existing on pollution and deforestation, it's normal. What climate change is technology change people's lifestyle.

Commenting for the algorithim
#####
America is only 15% of the pollution but it's us who are expected to solve 100% of the problem. Only YANG acknowledges this even though everyone knows it. Yang is America First on climate change and the only one who is willing to develop geo-engineering drones to assert ourselves on the enemies of the planet like China, India, and SE Asia.
#####
Mmmmmm. Tell me more

Constitutional climate amendment, sounds  good, hope it's better then the green deal they were pushing, witch was broken.

Mr. Yang,
I‚Äôm asking this of all presidential candidates, except Warren as she has blocked comments. 
What is the root research you are you using for your position on climate change? Anyone under 25 doesn‚Äôt count.

So less rights, more taxes, and more illegal immigrants. I like yang and all but being president doesn't do much of anything. One man can't fight the corruption that is the american government.
#####
Yangs climate change plan is perhaps the most comprehensive and effective out of all the candidates. Much better than the green new deal.
#####
Dad yes
#####
Wait, who downvoted on less pollution and less oil company subsities?
#####
Constitutional Amendment, which President is forward thinking as Yang to help protect not just not USA, but Earth itself?
#####
Hows this guy uploading every Seceond ?
#####
I work in the oil industry the mans right!
#####
Ad is good, not super informative for the average voter but shows his commitment to fighting climate change. Yang needs to debate like his candidacy depends on it. maybe ad a few seconds for policy?
#####
If this was paid for by our donations, and this was paid for by "friends of Andrew Yang", then we must be friends with Andrew Yang ^ - ^
#####
A solid ad, but not sure more people will understand what a Constitutional Climate Amendment will do. I wish he spent an extra few seconds on how it'll benefit the everyday person in their language.
#####
"heal the climate"  The planet wants to eat you and climate will change whether we're pumping out CO2 or not.  I can give Yang props for at least trying to focus more on getting people out of poverty as a good mitigation on the topic compared to the rest of the dems.  He still hasn't gone far enough in pulling back from the hysteria, though.
#####
I wish he mentioned that his plan will actually be good for the economy because many people are scared of the effects on the economy.
#####
I am glad someone is changing the climate change narrative. We have been hearing "Climate change is an emergency" for so long that we are numb to the call to action. Yang admiting that we are too late to stop it and the focus should shift to mitigation shows a better understanding of the problem than most other  candidates.
#####

I have an opinion about oil drilling from earth I think the oil work as the oil in a car motor
 it keeps the a cooling in the motor so if you remove the oil that keeps the motor cool it will heat up 
so it will be the same to the earth if you remove the oil from the earth it will heat up because the nucleus of the earth is hot as the sun
#####
Challenge Accepted!

This man needs to win for the sake of the US.
#####
Better than the Debates. No finger pointing, bickering. This man just makes too much sense. Let see how America will fu** this up. This man is what America needs. C'mon America we can do it.
#####
He should had been president  yesterday!
#####
Actually, I listen to Andrew Yang's talks to learn about American Foreign Policy and lots of other important facts about running a country!!!  I don't know how someone can hold so much information in one brain!  He's a super problem solver and he WILL solve the problem of getting the "Freedom Dividend" through congress...... he will be successful in putting the money into our hands!!! yang2020
#####
My son is dropping out off college because of our incomes ... I will vote for yang .. hopefully it will helps my kids
#####
Great interview just didn't like the SAT part where he mentioned that 12 year olds take SAT's.  Only gifted children do that, normal people take it in high school junior or senior year. We're not all crazy smart and asian Yang.
#####
Math!
#####
people will give more to Charaties
#####
If they shut out Andrew from the next debate how about this: Yang goes on stage somewhere in front of a live audience, perhaps in the very same city as the debate, and he answers the questions the panel puts forward to each candidate and then he rebuttles each of their response. The whole thing would be streamed live and the entire world will get to see how he addresses problems and solves them.....one of the problems being, him not being allowed to enter the debate. 


What do you guys think?

Andrew Yang will put the Republican Party to great shame.  Yang is light years ahead of any  Republican    The Republican Party has been sleeping under a rock for many a centuries   Wake up America take back your country  go Yang!
#####
5000 up votes and 37 down. This candidate can unite our country. If you are registering for the first time as a Republican, please consider instead registering as an independent, so you can vote for Yang in the primary. If registered as a republican, you can re-register as an indie, and vote for Yang in the upcoming primary.  Yang is a win-win.
#####
YANG/HARRIS 2020
#####
Its wild to me that there are skeptics of Yang with the belief that "he is too nice and wont get anything done in office if he gets elected" when it is quite apparent he is a bigger man of action that any of the other candidates. He doesn't sit and wait for change, he has a track record of achieving! Other candidates have scoffed at his non-political background but I feel like that makes him feel more human than the others because he has put himself in our shoes and seen the hidden problems of our generation. Yang2020!!!
#####
Why not address single parents as a bad for children
especially people of color
that's why asian are doing better even than white people.
saying it systemic racism problem wont solve anything
I think yang is carefull to stay in ligne with the democrates agendas
#####
it's kind of impressive how much Andrew yang knows.  now being president he probably wont have the power to do everything he wants because of the left and right side clash but the direction and focus is definitely for the people.
#####
The Yang gang is so stupid.
#####
....Come on, confess! You voted Trump in 2016, and you're very sorry now!.... So be a **YINYANGS**2020! Don't vote Trump again, vote YANG!.... vote YINYANGS 2020....

After phone banking more than 100 calls, found out people either don't know Andrew or like him. That means anyone who knows Andrew will/ like him.
#####
Neoliberal solutions from neocons like Yang aren't a solution for anyone
 but the wealthy corprotists and the wealthy, centrists Democrat hacks 
of the DNC/DCCC that support trickle down lies and GOP policies.  Yang 
is a plant, a planed distraction against real progressive solutions can 
candidates.

When President Yang gets inaugurated, I will cry tears of joy. I will probably pass out! I would be so happy!
When President Obama got elected, I cried tears of joy and was so emotional because of what it meant in a historical and cultural context of this country.
With President Yang, it would be because of what it means for our FUTURE!
#####
Wow, who is this Yang guy?
#####
The idea of UBI giving the necessary security to young people to avoid abusive relationships and toxic dependencies was excellent. It will definitely resonate with a lot of people in similar situations.
And Mr. Future President - what's up with  hand - to pockets movement when you tell a joke lately ? It's cringing me out man :) 
Keep it real !
#####
Yang always say "do you know what i mean?"


Do you know what I am saying?

He'd be a great HUD

I grew up having a really hard time understanding academics and politicians. Even with my undergrad, I just chalked it to me not being savvy enough to get it. Listening to Yang made me realize that my lack of understanding was just due to the obfuscation that people dish out to sound smart. Yang speaks clearly in plain language without trying to complicate my understanding. Great speaker, thanks Yang!
#####
Psychology dept in major hospitals doesn't treated the patients as the old time.  If  anyone have problems needed talk to a professionals,  These days, the psychologist gives you a pill instead, 
they no longer have time and resources talking to a person in mental, emotional trauma.  So the easiest way to treat the symptom is give you a pill for half of day or so.  That's why
we have heavy duty mental patients roaming around not able to be listened to but pops the pills.
#####
I fell very confident in his Leadership!  Trump LEAVE NOW! THERE IS NO NEED FOR YOU!
#####
I wish he was running as an independent both parties have a great deal of negative baggage.

Hello Andrew, I remember that you advocate for psychologist in the White House.  You should pick Jordan Peterson.  It would be a force to be reckon with.
#####
I still have the same high like I hear the speech the first time, I'm 60. So stunning but so real. My kids said I'm so obsess about AY. Went through what we went through, as an American fellow, how can I not? AY is my and our president!!
#####
What a breath of fresh air
#####
The entire concept behind jails for profit is ... obviously sick.
#####
It's interesting how just a few months ago Andrew was saying that automation would be impacting truck driving jobs in the future.  But now the speech has changed to reflect the impact is happening now as UPS and others are testing self driving trucks.  Technology, automation, AI is moving faster than we can anticipate and the impact will be far more devastating for jobs than we are ready for.
#####
Please vote for this man üôèüò©

Crime can be brought down over night with, Mr. Yang's, idea... here's how: If you stay out of trouble you get the money, but if you get into trouble, then you get locked-up, and you loose your grant for some specified amount of time... and you MUST finish high school, or maintain a specific G.P.A. ( grade point average ) Reward and punishment... Currently, the only reward is unfunded, with "Well your not locked up! "  as the reward; A little financing helps; hell OUR money goes to countries that DO NOT have OUR best welfare at heart! Speaking of "WELFARE" it is prescribed right there in the "Preamble of the U.S. Constitution"  " TO PROVIDE FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE!" Mr. Yang's approach will do this more directly than any of us alive Today, has ever seen...  The word " WELFARE" has been demonized big time by lots of U.S. lobbyists, and hatefully stingy crooks ( sociopaths ) posing as public servants!
#####
Mr. Yang's, consistency in his message, indicates that he is decisive in his ideas and decision making... Good sign!  When your story constantly changes you are either liar, or you are not decisive, or both...
#####
If, we can give, Israel, 3.8 Billion Dollars/ year for 10 years, and they can use part of that money to pay some of the U.S. congress people $15,000/ month to honor the N.D.A's ( None Disclosure Agreements ) signed by them, then we MUST pay every, American, citizen $1,000/month... as per, Mr. Yang's ideas.
#####
I am not a rabid trump supporter, but the free press need to be less money grubbing, and put,  Mr. Yang, on the tube to give him fare exposure to the people, unless what trump says about their honesty is true... Andrew Yang and Jimmy ( THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH ) McMillan, 2020!
#####
Plus, an overwhelmingly duly elected 'President Yang' would really humble/pee-off the Chinese government....Not to mention the Putin communist......(wait a minute...did he just say something like 'ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country!' ??)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...
#####
Andrew Yang, 'makes' me want to vote even way more than I did anyways...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...He's like a fresh version of the best of the other candidates, plus much of the best of the historical presidential-heroes of everyday people...You know, like FDR, JFK, LBJ, MLK Jr (well, not a president, but still feels like it), Honest Abe, Ike, Jefferson, Madison....AND, what we ALL need for the future that is really happening, not the one the right wingers keep forcing into our minds through their tv stations, religious and political positions of so much power........wow.....Still like all the dem-candidates...LOVE this guy!

Please speak /insert yourself at the debates. There is no need to wait for questions. It is a debate in a way still- make it one- go for Bernie since it' s the same base and we all need your ideas, not those whose time has passed. Thank you for everything, Yang 2020

Yang is the DArk horse,  almost bet 15 to 1, vegas odds.
Practical, 
1. define the problem
2. study it.
3. and  most practical solution.  not political.
if he was white, i think Yang would be even higher chance of Potus status.
one thing i noticed, is that everyone he talks in front of They all like what he says and the way he says it.
real chance, once he gets beyond the second plat to.
#####
I support yang!
#####
The media only covers people with the most money... they‚Äôre getting paid. Just my theory on why he hasn‚Äôt got a lot of coverage.
#####
I love that Yang isn't ideological and I love that he always answers the questions. That's really refreshing. He's not here to pander or vilify anyone. He's here to solve problems for all of us.

people get paid to live in Alaska because no one wants to live there.

I love how Yang always gives the same answer on impeachment:

*Every Democrat Ever*: Don't you agree with us that we should impeach donald trump?

*Yang*: yeah, but how about we stop giving him attention. You know you're just playing into his hand, right?

Warren and Sander's plans are too hard to implement.  Too many ways for the rich to evade that tax and too much work for the IRS every year.  $1,000 a month is much easier to implement via a simple VAT tax.  It actually works similar to the idea of "Taxing the rich".  If you are rich and has a lavish lifestyle that buys tons of stuff, you will pay more VAT tax.  If you are a frugal single mom, you won't buy as much, but still get $1,000 a month to help you with your expenses.

The UBI is smart, because when you raise minimum wage then the companies response by cutting hours and jobs.. Lowering their cost so they still make the profit they projected and upholding to their shareholders.. it‚Äôs ridiculous for a s

Andrew Yang with the vision, insight, and data driven policies. Yang 2020!

*Andrew and Pete* must have a one on one debate As soon as possible if Andrew Yang would like to clear his name and visions for American. As of now a lot of people maybe very well *Unsure* who to vote for when two candidates sound so very similar to one other.

Wow, this thumbs up/down ratio

Such a great interview! President Yang will be such a crucial turning point for this country.

UBI could be better than the current welfare system as long as its completely scrapped, along with the complete elimination of the minimum wage. But automation is not the problem.  Government labor laws, taxes, and regulations are killing jobs. Automation is mitigating the damage.

This man, isn't just trying to correct what's broken in this country but he's planning for those issues on the horizon.

Take your 1000 dollars and shove it up your ass...can't believe how many people  are falling for his gimmick

Absolutely love this guy. I can't believe he isn't the front runner. Can't people see what I see. The rest are either fake politicians or just flat out wrong on so many issues
#####
Everyone talks about Amazon sucking 30% of malls but Nobody is talking about how Andrew Yang is sucking up 30% of American voters every day.
#####
Yang is the bipartisan breaker candidate. The one with policies that satisfy both sides and the common people.

He's not talking about massive social programs or proportional wealth tax hikes. The Dems can agree with him because his policies would massively help the working class with a safety net. The conservatives can agree with him (or at least accept him) because his major policy actually would trim the fat of "social" policies while bolstering the overall economy (a trickle "up" effect, if you will). Common people can agree with him because his policies will bolster their own lives and give individual freedom to decide what areas of their lives need the most monetary attention.

If we must live in a super corporatist society, then a BUI is going to be necessary, lest the weight of the upper class crushes the lower class. Yang Gang for life... Let's save this country from bipartisan bullshit. Let's save this country from itself.

Off topic but was the woman there just to look pretty? Why didn't they give her any questions? What is up with that ABC?
#####
You know what is really awesome? I remember wishing Elizabeth Warren would run last cycle. I remember being super sad Bernie didn't get up. Now there are so many people on that stage I could like. But even among all the awesome, YANG is still so far ahead of them in my mind. 

For a LONG time, many decades, I have wished for a candidate that didn't care about ideological crap. That was NOT AFRAID to say something like "decriminalise drugs" because all that person would do is just search for world's best practice and go for that. No matter how it plays, no matter if it's popular. He'll bring the vision and educate people to MAKE it popular if people see that it is true.

YANG is my guy. World's best practice. Data and practical solutions over belief.

And the other thing, he's up there to communicate with the other candidates. He's respectful of their position and doesn't care about winning for himself but for others. I mean, the people who want it the most and the last who should have it. Yang is all these things.
#####
EVERYONE GET REGISTERED AS A DEMOCRAT SO ANDREW CAN WIN THE PRIMARIES, EVEN IF YOU WANT TRUMP TO WIN. IF TRUMP LOSES TO YANG, YOU STILL WIN BECAUSE YOU'LL BE GETTING $1000 A MONTH FOR LIFE DEPOSITED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT !

every time Yang talks about his ideas, I actually get excited for what he could bring to this country

Only it isnt a dividend.¬† It is a redistribution of wealth - primarily from the upper and middle class - that will be funded by a VAT - which is a tax on consumers, not on businesses.

Dont want to feel like your efforts are under valued by the economy? Then find a way to make your efforts valuable.

There is a guy on YouTube who made a 7 minute video that earned him $33,000.00 in ad revenues in one year.

Andrew Yang has a grasp and understanding at what is the underlying forces that are causing the effects. The negative perception of UBI has been conditioned and stigmatized by the wealthy for generations. It is perceived as a handout, charity something that should be shameful. The reality is it the most practical solution that kills multi birds with one stone. It should appeal to both the Left & Right. Let me explain my understanding that it not only makes sense, but it vitally necessary!

Everything revolves around the concept of LEVERAGE. Leverage is the SUPER POWER that enables and  multiplies ones ability to carry MORE with LESS. The UBI (Freedom Dividend) really represents LEVERAGE. The $1000 allows one to gain a foothold and foundation to financially leverage the situation. Once leverage takes hold it begins to gain momentum. As we know leverage is the key ingredient that enables the ability to carry multiple times your weight. This enables and minimizes the probability in burdening others in helping to carry that weight. Some people like Chump have been fortunate to have won a golden ticket in the birth lottery, essentially they were born into an extreme level of leverage. Their leverage foothold is the equivalent of being on top of the mountain. As everyone knows he who hold the higher ground will generally prevail 9 out of 10 times. Their leverage position allows for 1/10000th the amount of energy to exert than one who is at ground level. So the larger the gap the more extreme the leverage becomes. The wealthy which hold the higher ground have little incentive to circulate that wealth back into the system which may compromise their leverage.

Can anyone deny that $1000 will not make a school teachers job much easier and fulfilling. To teach without the stress of survival occupying a place in their mind. In Fact the dividend may provide the leverage for someone to pursuit the noble profession of teaching. And for the growing homeless population across this country, what could $1000 a month do to those who are living in their car or the streets because the cost of living is beyond a minimum wage job. Raising the Minimum Wage will not even come close to the impact of a $1000 a month will do. If fact employers will cut hours and try to hire people under the table to avoid the higher payroll tax they need to match per employee. This helps both Business owner and provides more money in hand to support that business with patronage.

The time has come to break the STIGMA and MYTHS  which we have been conditioned to. Especially The Trickle Down Economy Myth. The WEALTHY ARE NOT JOB CREATORS!!! CUSTOMERS ARE!! No Business can exist without CUSTOMERS. You may have the Greatest Products or Services and it still will not make a difference without CUSTOMERS. So if people CANNOT AFFORD your goods or service, then guess what? You will go OUT OF BUSINESS! If you are a Company or Businessman then it would be in your own best interest to support something like UBI. Otherwise, to support these Wealthy Pricks with TAX BREAKS and SUBSIDIES is beyond short sighted and will ultimately work Against your interests. A greater wealth gap will only cause DESPERATION and ANXIETY which will build even greater Economic Instability and lead to Crime. A real Powder Keg which can have negative consequences across the board from rich to poor a virtually guarantee of Civil Unrest. Your GREED AND SELFISHNESS has left you Blind to the obvious. The Obvious move is you will receive a greater amount of wealth if it is spread out and not concentrated; instead of choking and Killing the golden goose up front. It would be much wiser to feed and look out for the Gooses best interest, you will be rewarded with a flow of Golden Eggs.

The biggest criticism to UBI is the cost. Again this is Short sighted blinded by the massive positive effect on the economy across the board. Starting with the release of pressure and anxiety that scarcity brings. It allows ones mental health to thrive in conditions of abundance instead of scarcity. With a scarcity mindset you feel constricted needing to save income by holding on to every penny reducing spending to just the essentials. This effects businesses with less patronage. With less desperation creates less need to commit crimes. With economic despair many commit crimes to purposely be locked up to gain food and shelter. A burden on the tax payer. Huge amount of money saved by minimizing the welfare bureaucracy system. And as Andrew Yang suggest a value added tax of fraction of a percent per purchase would not even be noticed.

And for all you champions of CAPITALISM.

It's time to receive our our dividends from our other Capital ventures we have invested in. Like the Military Arms Industry and Financial Industry. Starting the for profit military arms manufacturing Industry. This Industry is Technically a damaging type Socialism. A Socialism that does not serve society, instead it uses society as a means of CAPITAL. It is called Subsidized Capital. "We the People" subsidize the industry through government contracts. Contracts which are financed through the capital provided by taxes. Thus if this was truly a Capitalist venture then "We the People" are investors and should share in the profits gained from that capital. That capital enable the means of the production. As investors not only did we not receive a dividend when arms are sold to other nations. The US sells weapons and Military equipment to many Nations around the world. Creating huge profits. Profits which were enabled by the Peoples Capital. If we are a true Capitalist system then those who provide their Capital to risk should receive a dividend for their investment. And it time to receive our dividends for providing the bail out CAPITAL to the Wall Street Financial Industry.

HUGE supporter here but this ad is incredibly misleading. Most early novel discoveries are done in academia which is funded by NIH ,NSF (Gov grants). However,  in order to fully develop a discovery and bring it out into the market for safe consumption it takes ~10+ years of development by pharmaceutical companies. The work of both academia and pharm are essential for the end goal.

after the whipped cream goof. i dont know whats gonna happen to his campaign. So right now we have 4 candidates fighting for the common people (lower-middle, middle and lower class). Bernie Sanders Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang and apparently Warren. I am sure about the first three not so about the 4th. because campaign and debate promises are not set in stone.

Andrew Yang, I just watched your New Hampshire townhall. Someone asked you about how you'll fund your Freedom Dividend. You talked about VAT and taxing tech giants but I always notice that you have been evasively omitting that VAT will cover everyone because it's a consumption tax. I'm not sure what your game plan is but it's not a good thing to build your campaign on tactical evasiveness and artful deception. If you are true, then you would lay out to the people and explain the full mechanism of VAT. I've heard some of your followers try to explain VAT but they can't confidently do so. Keep the voters informed. Maybe you're waiting for "the right time" but it's sounding like tactical evasion. It's like selling sugar-free sweeteners, nobody tells you about possible adverse effects. It's great marketing. It's the only thing I've consistently noticed about the Yang campaign...this evasiveness about explaining VAT. I agree with VAT. I'm just wondering if the American people are too stupid to understand it is that why you're not explaining it to them? I really wonder. Because with VAT there will definitely be a slight increase in the cost of goods and consumers will definitely feel that. I do think though that combining UBI will be the mechanism for redistribution and VAT is an ingenious idea. Are Americans too stupid to understand how VAT and the UBI will work??? Is that how stupid they are???? Doesn't their level of analytical skills take them there? I just really, really wonder. Isn't the ordinary voter capable of following that logic that's why discussing the VAT in full detail would be a a campaign misstep? Hmmm, Americans are too impressionable that's why they're not giving you a chance. It just totally baffles me. Such a critical element of this UBI proposal is VAT, but nobody's really discussing it as it should be discussed.
#####
So, Martin Shkreli lied?

This is by far Andrew Yang‚Äôs best ad! It catches your attention, infuses you with facts and leaves you picking your jaw up off the ground with the mic drop at the end. All within 30sec! Just brilliant. More please.

As someone with a Masters degree in Economics Andrew yangs UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME plan works.

Due to the economical demand-pull model, inflation only happens when there‚Äôs too much money in circulation, which is only approved by the fed reserve.

With Andrew Yangs plan, he‚Äôs using money already in circulation. Thus it would NOT lead to the inflation.

AI and advanced automation have the potential to create material abundance the likes of which have never been seen on this planet. I've been saying for years that it will either destroy the job market and take all of us with it, or we can restructure our economy to make that abundance available to all of us. For the longest time I believed the prior option to be the most likely, thank god for the appearance of Andrew Yang, he's finally given me hope that we may just pull this thing off and enter into an age of unimaginable prosperity.

My G0d first I heard about Yang from who ever it is I love u

Yang is not "CRITICAL OF THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION".  He is just pointing out that we are not properly prepared for it.  His policies are designed to address this issue and prevent a rapidly approaching social and economic disaster - which is why big tech companies agree with and even support him.

As someone who lives and works in Silicon Valley I don‚Äôt think he is bashing anyone - he isn‚Äôt trying to stifle progress or tech at all, he is identifying problems and suggesting solutions

Andrew yang from my understanding is basically saying humans are outdated, we can't out think and out perform technology. That humans need a hand out from technology companies. That humans are a drag to technology. For example, he said that not everyone wants to use computers or program or work with technology.

saying yang is bashing big tech is like saying a sex educator is bashing sex for telling you to have safe sex.

"Bash..." Um, he understands technology and sees what needs to happen in order that tech doesn't leave humanity in the dust.

#ENDORSEANDREWYANG
#####
I‚Äôm 43 and never voted or cared about politics. I‚Äôve donated for the first time in my life to politics and will vote for YANG!
#####
This guy Rick is utilizing words that are somewhat misleading. Andrew is not against anything except "The War On Normal People". We all need to get up, and stand up for Andrew Yang! It's time to stop sitting on the side lines and complain because things are not getting better when we don't stand up and speak with our votes!! 90 million registered voters did not show up in 2016! It's time for a Blue Yang Tsunami Wave to crash over Washington DC's head!! Yang2020!!
#####
Yang üß¢ is For progress & technological advancement , he is just saying we need to re-write the economic rules for the 21st century 
And we need a new operating system ! Human Capitalism üá∫üá∏üß¢üá∫üá∏

Some want Yang to says some things 
But  if you believe in yang

Yang Yang Yang 2020
#####
Andrew Yang is not against the 4th industrial revolution.  He is saying we are IN this revolution n it‚Äôs making much of the jobs obsolete.  And the country is ill prepared for it and people are and more will suffer because of the change.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs running for President.
#####
Another Yang video another group of *PAID* interns who can't make it in the big world soo they make others pay for them.
#####
who else is from silicon valley? :)
#####
Yang is the only light in this political game.
#####
Thanks CBS News for the piece!.

#####
We need yang more then ever.
#####
He's not bashing them. Listen to what he is saying before making a bogus title like this.
#####
Change title? He didn‚Äôt bash anything

My vote is definitely Andrew Yang for our Next President!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #YangGang2020

I am a software engineer- and I support Andrew, he knows technology and human needs.
#####
Yang is not bashing silicon valley he wants to make sure that the american people get a tiny share of the winnings from big tech companies that makes billions in dollars but pay zero in taxes
#####
"He will one of the last one standing."
#####
I just contributed $10 to yang gang, hooray!
#####
YANG SMILE DID A LOT ..
#####
He never bashed them. He bashed corrupt companies and countries taking advantage of automation at the risk of people's employment. He also ran against Amazon's not paying their fair share in taxes. So I don't know why CBS thinks all of Silicon Valley are a hivemind that get offended when he bash a Facebook or Amazon.
#####
Register Dem and Vote Yang!
#####
Support for Yang from Italy ‚úåÔ∏è
#####
Like Elon Musk has endorsed him. He's not bashing, he's speaking for many of the leaders of "big" tech who want regulation AND to pay their share of taxes.
#####
Silicon valley love him because those people create the robot and can envision problems when thos robots take over people's job.

But they can't stop building because it is what it is..big tech company has invested tons of money since 20-30 years ago for the project. And due date to go live is only couple more years..

That's why they love Yang, because Yang can speak the concern and Yang try to actively find solution and create middle ground between Tech savvy and people
#####
Andrew Yang will be the last man standing.. Standing as The Best President of Our Time Andrew Yang!!!!..#YangGang2020üëç‚òëÔ∏èüòÅüíµüá∫üá∏

5:09 Nick Thompson-"He is one of the last ones standing".                                                                And I say- Andrew Yang is the last one standing.
#####
He is an entrepreneur who has a good understanding of technology and science and its effects on society and average people.  He is bashing Google, Amazon and so on but his UBI plan will make them even much more money than before but at the same time bringing more benefits to the average people.  If the executives are as smart as they claim on their resume then they should endorse his plan.
#####
üß¢ Amazon is portrayed not so much as the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô by Yang, rather as taking advantage of capitalism, but now it is time to regulate it and relieve the financial and workload of the American peopleüññ #HumanityFirst
#####
He does not bash tech or it‚Äôs advancements. He explains how they will impact us and the economy. Warns us to prepare now. He does t want to stop or slow innovation.
#####
Andrew Yang knows what's happening, yesterday, today, and tomorrow!
#####
He is not attacking techs. Its truth and reality, and everyone knows it! Everyone understands it once yang explains it.
#####
Nick Thompson is wrong in his lack luster research on Yang regarding his high technology knowledge.
#####
Yang will make America better
#####
Well take . It is becoming kind of rare when so called intelligent and educated people talk intelligently.
#####
When did Andrew Yang ever bash big Tech?
#####
The media doesn't know other words but "bash"
#####
God this woman is putting me to sleep
#####
Andrew Yang was made for such a time as this. None of the other candidates were addressing the perils of AI & automation. The 4th Industrial Rev was under the radar.
#####
He is not a pessimist. He is a REALIST. 
Do NOT underestimate the collaboration of AI, quantum computing and robotics.
#####
We‚Äôre gonna YangBang the vote in 2020üëçüèø
#####
Not left, not right, forward.
#####
Mastering the internet? I think people just support him.
Also I feel that the support he gets on the internet speaks louder than polls, which are over glorified imo.
(Since polls are gathered from landlines and not many people uses landlines anymore)
#####
Yang 2020
#####
This title is such crap. We see what you did CBS.
#####
Where talking about the next President of the United States, don't mind the noise in the background. Good job.
#####
Everything is pretty much imported here from China, Yang was born here in NY, parents are from Taiwan, not China. Most American-made candidates are faulty like the one in the Oval office, Yang has my vote.
#####
Next President Andrew Yang not only has a huge brain, hugely important has a big heart also. In recent history all america voters get nothing but empty promises. With Andrew Yang we as voters get for the first time solid dividend from the country.
#####
Why wouldn't they support him?  He has said that he won't do anything about tech monopolies with the facile comment 'it's all about the app'.  Any criticism of big tech is just window dressing for a horrible product so far as big tech is concerned.
He has some good policies.  He is the best on drugs and his freedom dividend is a good idea both to get people involved in politics and to remove corruption, but his bad ideas are as bad as his good ideas are good.
#####
UBI...this is something alaska is doing today. this is something republicans try to offer 4/5 decades ago? this is something martin luther king tried to offer. this is something elon musk is 100% for. so if OIL is working for the people of Alaska...why couldn't technology work for the rest of Americans? This is what yang is preaching with UBI.
#####

Would love to hear that strong counter argument, becuase this is already a game changing technology.
#####
Only candidate who focuses on real problems. I.e, Trump is a symptom of the disease, not the cause.
#####
Andrew made the interviewer look stupid and arrogant.  Therefore Andrew Yang cares and wants to make Americans have a better future.  He is the only person who is smart enough to outwit and beat Trump.
#####
"You know how to solve your own problems the best."  <3---------<<< #Freedomdividend
#####
This man needs to be our next president.
#####
Yang is the most brilliant, substantive, and visionary political thinker of our time.  Not only that, but he's a real statesman and a leader.  You can see it in how he handled the hostile interviewer and consistently responded with NOT deflection or defensiveness (as "politicians" often do), but diplomacy and intelligence.  The harder he was pushed, the stronger he got.  THIS IS THE LEADER AMERICA'S BEEN DESPERATELY IN NEED OF.
We can either get on board and propel ourselves to the forefront of the future, or we can stick with our old fossil politicians stuck in yester-year policies and keep falling farther and farther behind...  AMERICA, DON'T SCREW THIS UP!

when was the last time you answered your phone and took a poll?  Betting odds are much better than polls at predicting the winner!  Can Andrew Yang Win? YES!   https://www.canandrewyangwin.com/#
#####
Biden better NOT become the nominee!!!!  #yang2020
#####
The interviewer has no tact and no humor.  Yang did answer all questions intelligently and with thoughtful replies.  The joke is on the interviewer and the Washington Post.  No wonder Trump keeps on attacking the media with their 'fake news". In this case, it's not fake news but rather biased interview with hidden agenda.
#####
Oh my God, these were tough questions tailored against Andrew Yang.  The answers were interrupted too.  This man was trying to attack Andrew.
#####
Just for the record: the hypothetical person who is receiving $1200/mo in benefits from SNAP and TANF DOES NOT EXIST. These programs are not that generous - and even assuming they are, receiving $1200/mo in government benefits still makes them better off than the millions receiving $0/mo in government benefits for a myriad of reasons who are currently the worst off in this country. This was a very unfair point to push on Mr. Yang, and Mr. Yang did a disservice by not pushing back.
#####
The interviewer is a stiff! The questions are leading. Boo on bezos! Boycott this corp owned rag. The Post is no longer a credible news outlet. Btw Yang buried this stiff lol. Aloha Andrew Yang!!!
#####
46:00 Andrew Yang: Jeff Bezos owns this building.
Reporter: No, he owns Washington Post.
#####
20:58 "Why do you resist talking so much about tax increases on income?" 

Because for the vast majority of people income taxes punish work. Income taxes are largely irrelevant to the ultra wealthy as they have the legal, financial and political resources to easily game their way around it. This is why so many of the large corporate news channels are pushing for higher income taxes. Their owners have the politicians in their back pockets so they know they can manipulate the legislation in ways to avoid it, while also getting the brownie points of virtue signaling their egalitarianism by supposedly sticking it to the man and standing up for the little guy. A value added tax on the other hand, because it is a consumption tax that is implemented at every stage of value creation,  is many orders of magnitude more difficult to avoid than an income tax. So it's no wonder the rulers want to keep that idea buried.

In this world where we are consuming resources at an unsustainable rate you want to punish frivolous consumption not value creation and production.
#####
this cocky SOBs interviewers always thinks they can "get" Andrew Yang, when all they do is they make themselves look like stupid azzholes
#####
Andrew is literally schooling the interviewer as he goes
#####
Trump 2020 losers üá∫üá∏
#####
Interview starts @ 3:20
Much thanks to Robert Costa for not shying away from the hard questions. Andrew Yang's best interview yet?
#####
The best interview Andrew Yang has done by far. #Yang2020
#####
Washington Post I like to wipe  my Wet Ass with the Post
#####
How is he placing compared to the others? I saw that he's still one of the lowest in terms of voters. Biden, Sanders, Warren are top 3. I hope he climbs up more and has a real chance.
#####
The freedom dividend is opt in. And you can't double dip. No food stamps and freedom dividend. Need someone to ask him about inflation. And I'm for the VAT tax. And I can see how Trump will attack Yang. Yang is coming off as weak on foreign policy. And Trump will question his allegiance because he is Asian. But the reason Yang won't win is because African Americans don't know him. That's who chooses the Democratic nominee.
#####
Nice nice work Andrew!! dum bass Costas badly needs to be educated
#####
Jan. 20, 2021 President Yang will be sworn in.
#YangGang
#####
His explanation about not giving people on assistance the money makes no sense at all
#####
First ever Chinese US president. Open all borders to Chinese and demolish Chinese import tax please. We want to take over the US.
#####
you have to get rid of private insurance. you cannot pit the rich (private insurance) against the poor (government-run). it will create tension and uncertainty in the government-run system, which will lead to underfunding and insufficiency. universal single payer healthcare is the only system that achieves the fairness, justice and equality we seek. it is the only way to guarantee everybody the human right of health care.
#####
Stimulate economy from the demand side can somehow make sense.
#####
It‚Äôs about time to put somebody sensible in the Oval Office #YANG2020
#####
MY GOD!!! Andrew Yang is so right, I literally left the USA because of these things Andrew Yang explained in this interview, I got leyed off three times in a row and lost two apartments because of it and other jobs were so over stacked with applications until I felt I'm always overlooked, truely felt theres no hope in the USA anymore and i better get outta there so i packed my things and left the country and is now currently traveling the world because how fustraited I was with my life in the USA, things just didn't add up , Andrew Yang is the perfect person to be the next president, I really hope everyone sees his fight for the individual and not the corporations and not to even pack his own pockets like most politicians do as we all know, I love this guy!!
#####
It was great to see yang be pressured here. He was pushed off of his talking points (which are great) and had to improvise in responses. 

And he proved that he is 100% right. 

Yang2020 coming from a Trump supporter here.
#####
You cannot faze a man as well informed as Yang is. The one thing I worried about with him was his lack of foreign policy experience/ how he would deal with aggression from foreign governments. Then I realized he would deal with it exactly like the 'gotcha' questions in this interview, with a smile on his face, an approach backed up by a deep understanding of the facts on the ground and he would do it all while being both non-aggressive and completely firm in his position.  #yanggang
#####
@34:10 andrew yang stands in solidarity with the rioters in hong kong. great. why didn't washington post ask if he also stands in solidarity with the catalonians who have voted to be under spain's rule? racism in american media is always so palpable.
#####
The host asked a gotcha question regarding HK ‚Äúdemocracy protest‚Äù, Yang answered as best as he could as the fact is nuanced. The fact is the audience did not know the details. The protesters destroyed properties, attacked the police and committed the cardinal sin by stepping on and defacing the National flag while hoisting American  and British flag in a Chinese territory. Even US government would call this anti-American if such act happened here for sure. Kaepernick was criticized for taking a knee ( a even more profound gesture of submission than the common gesture). This is a cheap shot on the part of the host.
#####
Don't forget Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. This is them trying to turn up the heat. My boy Andrew Yang handle it like a pro
#####
How can people not see that what we need the most right now IS Andrew Yang, a president who fully understands technology. In this day and age it should be a requirement to understand it. 

It is becoming essential in all parts of our lives.
#####
I support Hong Kong üá≠üá∞ and fuck China just say it Andrew yang2020
#####
People need to stop giving the interviewer a hard time. Try and take your personal bias out of it; I get it that it's hard to not be impressed with Yang's answers (I sure am), but it's his job to get through a catalogue of questions. It's great that he does this as it's becoming even clearer to everyone with a somewhat open mind that Yang is by far the best candidate in the field; he never got rattled, he stays on point, he's not rambling, etc....
If they follow the same line of questioning, it will become obvious how much ahead of the rest of the field Yang really is.
#####
Actually I think the interviewer did a great job with all his questions, which  gave Andrew Yang an opportunity to  discuss many different issues, and Yang did shine!
#####
Love the questions! Really want to know his take on international issues. However, I feel that his answer to how to deal with China/Hong Kong is a bit weak, as if he's afraid to offend China.
#####
Andrew President Yang. 2020 #YangGang
#####
Rejoice America, Yang is here!
#####
Holy shit Joe Biden if you make Yang your VP you got my vote.... Yang is the only person I fully believe in.
#####
Work: What you watching?
Me: Oh just our next President talking in an interview.
Work: Send us the email to the link sounds like this guy knows what he talking about lols
#####
Yang's UBI: Everyone 18 and up that is an American Citizen get's the $1,000 if you already getting Government help and its less the $1,000 say your getting in $400 in Food stamps Yang's UBI will give you $600 instead of the $1,000 to match it up to $1,000. If your getting more then $1,000 in government help then you can choose to keep your government help or forgo it for the $1,000 month. It's not hard to understand. How is it paid for a VAT tax on luxury goods and doesn't matter if your the poor or rich you get hit with that VAT tax but doesn't matter cause its a cycle
#####
I think the interviewer was surprised by the honesty when Andrew Yang answered that last question.
This is a man that genuinely inspires my vision for the future. 
Not just on policy, but on how people could treat each other.
#####
Yang is for REAL! I am all in.
#####
Based on the viewcounts from youtube, I don't think Yang is getting enough attention(which he deserves) from people yet. Oh wait.. maybe I'm wrong since I'm watching this from South Korea. Anyway I am a little bit jealous to see you guys having such a hard-studying presidential candidate.

This lifestyle can be for everyone! #yanggang

America,Get you asses out there and Vote this man in. We may not deserve him, but we need him.  #Yang2020
#####
46:04 Funny little one two joke there
#####
A lot of people are giving the interviewer shit. I think he did his job. I don't like it when the interviewer and subject are on good terms. Indeed, I prefer it when they're evidently hostile to one another. It gives me reason to believe that they're being honest.
#####

Would the interviewer have asked if Bernie ,warren or Biden stand with the Hong Kong protesters? Or did he only ask yang because he's Asian üòÇ
#####
Impressed with AY's patience and cool headedness.
#####
Vote for him in the primaries !!!!!! That‚Äôs more important than the general election right now.
#####
Interviewer could work on active listening lol
#####
I have to vote for Yang after this ! Fuck warren, y ah completely changed my mind on things
#####
Stereotype away Andrew Yang.  I'm not offended at all.  You're not too far off anyway.
#####
Only see Andrew Yang, Beto, Pete, etc, no need to SEE.
#####
Imagine having a smart person as a president.  Would be a nice change from what we got now.
#####
Felt good with a guy who will Truly Revolutionize America and the World!!! A much better REVOLUTION than BERNIE's.
#####
Google just hit quantum supremacy, meaning quantum computers that have stronger processing power than a room full of supercomputers, meaning better A.I., which leads software that performs way better than people. UBI is the only solution.

Costa & the WPost went with a slick side hit job with this interview. It did the exact opposite of their intentions.
#####
sorry Yang Bernie has 100x more supporters and 3.3 mil individual donars No one compares to Bernie  #OnlyBernieFights4Us
#####
Wow
#####
He‚Äôs just a Bezos‚Äô bot
#####
A point that was brought up in the NPR interview, too, was that the Freedom Dividend will not solve the massive existential problems facing American society, which Yang is correct to introduce to our political conscience. People and interviewers like to play 'gotcha' with this point, but they are really casting light on a rather shameful flaw in the American voting base, at large, which is that for some  insanely dumb reason we believe and vote for politicians based souly on the expectation that they will solve our deepest national existential problems... and then we are butt hurt complain about politicians always being the same until the next election when we again are duped and vote for whoever claims to have the cure for our greatest exisistential threats. In this way, the American public created it's own hollow nightmare and continues to feed it. Andrew Yang breaks that cycle. UBI was never meant to solve any of the massive national and global existential crises that face us in the very near future (while other candidates are content to do the easy work to harp on Trump) but it damn well will give individual Americans a chance to look up and step  FORWARDS into a soberingly darker future without having to worry about how to make rent. If you are tired of Left vs Right games and are ready to give yourself a monthly boost AND wash out corporate money from our rotten political process, if you want to put your vote behind the HUMANITY of America, vote YANG and visit yang2020.com to see the MATH yourself!
#####
Voting for Andrew Yang
#####
Washington Post, get rid of this interviewer; he has probably lost you hundreds if not thousands of potential subscribers. Absolutely rediculous.

Thankfully Yang can deal with it wonderfully.
#####
Love how the last question he asked if Yang would join the Biden Ticket and he said yes... What a mic drop, this smear artist Costa was speechless, you could tell he didn't have time to dig in and wanted to so badly
#####
I have yet to vote for a major parties candidate for president since turning 18. I have voted in every presidential election since, but wrote in who I thought was the actual best choice. If- no, I'll say WHEN Yang gets the nomination, it will be the first time I've voted for a major party candidate. He has consistently impressed me on most topics (I really only disagree with taxing meat. I think there are better ways to affect change), and the simple fact that he explaines the logic instead of relying on talking points.
#####
The freedom dividend is a fantastic idea. It is an insufficient amount to solely depend on but gives one the freedom to upgrade and re-skill themselves to newer industries without having to worry too much financially during their transition periods. It has more benefits than cost for the economy!

Jeez, how can you vote to elect anyone other than Yang?!  No matter how you want to ignore or marginalize him (mainstream media), he will be making you eat your lunch in the polls.  But very pleased to even have more and more interview opportunities with Andrew Yang.  Be careful how you marginalize Yang.

Robert Costa asked many critical questions, and Yang was on fire. I was riveted. At first, I saw the question cards in Costa's hands and mistook this segment as a scripted smear interview due to Washington Post's other pieces on Yang. But I soon realized that having Yang right there, asking him all the difficult questions people unfamiliar with Yang's positions would ask, and then some, just handed Yang's campaign his next "Rogan interview" to slice and distribute to those skeptical of Yang's positions. Great interview, both Costa and Yang.
#####
Yang is the future
#####
WE LOVE YANG!!!
#####
That interviewer was so against Yang and his fun and exited spirit. Kinda ruined the entire interview, he should not have that job.
#####
I haven‚Äôt watched GOT this excited as I watched Andrew Yang interviews and rallies. üß¢üá®üá¶
#####
I know this guy works for Amazon and kinda hates Andrew, but his douchiness makes me want to punch my screen.
#####
Bob should probably talk to Nathan Rich about the HK "democracy" protests. Don't try to force your imperialism ideology down to Yang's throat.
#####
Anyone who plans to vote owes it to themselves to check out yang2020.com and read the policies for themselves. This man is kind and wise and approachable, but his campaign is one of the most dead serious opportunities we have, as Americans, to correct our trajectory FORWARDS!
#####
Wow...Just wow....America, The choice is clear now
#####
Giving every one $1,000 a month (asuming this can be done through value added taxation) is the simplest way to continuously stimulate the economy and continuously generate more jods for all of us.

Yang!
#####
I would die for this man.  He needs to be President, especially now.
#####
The God dam finesse of this man. Everyone is amazed that he is handling himself so well with these questions that are designed to trip him up. That's because these are the real ideas he actually plans on doing as President. Please America, get educated on voting dates and how to register because the main stream media will not help. We must take this into our own hand. MATH.

How hard is it to understand that 1k directly given to American citizens is better than an institution deciding how, how much, and who to allocate "benefits" to. These reporters/journalist never cease to amaze me...they're literally paid to be ignorant. Costa kept asking "why is giving 1k to individuals better than putting the money into "education" (government retraining)". Despite the fact that Yang clearly states that the citizens themselves. would know best what to do for themselves.

I have never donated to a campaign and not really seen a democratic candidate that I ever even liked.... he is genuine, humble and had great ideas and understanding of the people... donations for the first time to the yang gang
#####
Buttigieg is a playbook Candidate. Policies I‚Äôve heard none. Not enough experience .  Yang is an exceptional candidate . He represents the new vision for this country.
#####
If this article holds up, it looks like Andrew Yang is a real contender in Iowa.  I've read that most Iowans don't commit until the caucus.  https://whotv.com/2019/12/20/with-more-than-a-12-pack-of-choices-undecideds-want-beer-with-yang/

Its not Left its not Right, Its Forward!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Yang 2020! Free shit
#####
Why does Yang's truck say medicare for all, when he's really for public option?
#####
The Democrats should do something not expected and nominate Yang to run against Trump. He's not a politician, he has no baggage, he wants to make America great as well. Every other candidate is a politician and will be destroyed in a landslide by Trump.....but not Yang.
#####
I‚Äôm sure Evelyn is a wonderful person, but I really hate what America has done to this beautiful young Asian woman‚Äôs sound and tone of her voice.

Thanks DM register!! This was fantastic
#####
Thanks for hosting this. While I'm a Bernie supporter, it's been horrifying to see how abysmally Yang has been treated by almost all of the media. From debate shenanigans (killing his mic, not giving him fair time) to the not covering him in the MSM, to removing him from poll results, it's reminded me of how Bernie was treated in 2015.

Love this man the more I listen to him.  I think it's finally hitting deep in me when he says, Humanity First and discussing human value vs a person's economic value.
#####
people believed trump was going to change the status quo, nope not him, andrew yang is the man, he notices the PROBLEMS, and he has sound solutions to SOLVE them
#####
people going to make like 20 babies if ubi passes lmaos

Like Mayo Pete, Yang has no national experience. He'd be easy prey for the MIC.

I can feel how united the audience was,  they're attentiveness while he speaks. Great speaker, facts behind his words, and definitely voting for him the first chance I get. I see a brighter future for us, America... This is your guy!

At around the 26:54 mark, a woman in the crowd hands something to Andrew Yang and asks if he has ever heard of the Adverse Childhood Experienced survey.  Here is a link on that topic from the CDC

there is a reason why a man like jeff Bezos is pushing ubi. 
Bezos makes 215 million per day while his employees live in poverty. he is not pushing ubi because he cares about regular people. UBI is just a way to keep capitalism afloat in a jobless future. a form of life and home insurance for ultra-rich capitalist. a right wing capitalist tool.
#####
dude is my president
#####
He talk big talk but he can‚Äôt walk the walk. All his policies are vague. I didn‚Äôt get a clear answer on anything. I watched his interviews and went on his website. He is not for M4all like he said earlier this year. He is already back peddling on his positions. Don‚Äôt fall for cheap slogans like MATH and ‚Äúnot right. Not left but forward.‚Äù He is just full of crap.

Can Americans think harder? Can you think harder like Andrew Yang? Think hard if you are Andrew Yang"s supporters and bring him moving forward into the White House in Washington!
#####
Say what you're going to do for all of us you nitwit fool. Not just simply wanting to beat trump. That's what's important to me

It's almost like Andrew Yang can see the future.......but really, everyone that was a phenomenal  leader (just does the math) in their minds and calculates which way to go.  Andrew Yang has those phenomenal leadership characteristics!!!
#####
Wealth tax was high back in the 1950s, and middle class prospered.
That's what BERNIE IS TRYING TO BRING BACK!
Wealth tax, and his exit tax(because the wealthy hide their money offshore) are brilliant plans of BERNIE! 
What Yang wouldn't say about UBI is that....and from his mouth in an interview.....with UBI, you can't have Medicare and food stamps. You can't be in both programs. 
You can be in food stamps and have UBI, but you will get the difference e.g. if you get 300 in food stamps, you get $700/mth UBI to do whatever you want....medical bills, medication etc. 
Not everyone's bills are the same....and this will still keep most people in poverty!
#####
Is that Yang's wife?
#####
LOVE Andrew but his WIFE was cringe to listen to. Why does she sound like a privilege dumb blonde chick from ‚ÄúWhite Chicks‚Äù the movie.
#####
Yang should be talking about repealing citizens united law that panders to the corporate agenda to destroy honest elections 
Yang should be talking about eliminating gerrymandering and the electoral college or bring electoral college into the 21st-century with the required technological where every all 50 states get the vote in an election not just like the 12 to 14 chosen states...How about the elimination of private for profit prisons 
$1000 a month is $12,000/year before taxes and still half what Bernie is calling for $15/hr is $31,000 before taxes.
You cannot eradicate poverty if you don‚Äôt do anything about the revolving door for retiring representatives becoming corporate lobbyist and the reverse in DC and all across the country or unravel the corporate agenda that has been going on for almost 100 years to take it all from everyone because the greedy rich do not have it all and the poor have too much. It appears to be the corporate philosophy.
Will Yang actually be able or willing to do anything about that?
$12,000 is nothing compared to the money those greedy bastards made from that last tax cut and every tax cut since Reagan.
Before Nixon we had a single-payer system... Nixon and his regime privatized medicine that‚Äôs when things started to slide downhill for affordable American medical care system.

I like, Andrew Yang, But I HATE ABORTION! Abortion and same sex marriage are the reasons I left the Democratic Party... Planned parent-hood=the murder of children. I now vote Independent... With a thousand dollars per/month raising children should be easier. Abortion may be a deal breaker for me and Mr. Yang! The killing of children is ALWAYS wrong! You can't build a strong work force, replace soldiers lost in battle... let alone have a strong voter turn-out! Abortion is a loosing prospect...Mr. Yang.
#####
Yang is a great guy.
#####
Left and Right are deviations, but forward is strait ahead,  and true!

Andrew Yang, outweighs Sandman-Sanders on all fronts because, while sanders blocks jobs and talks against the rich... He puts NOTHING into your pockets... Not honoring the " Provide For The General Welfare" clause written into the "Preamble" of OUR constitution! Sanders and the rest fall FAR short of Mr. Yang! Americans, are many... This is why we are a nation where patriots live. Nazis ( Nationalist+Zionists ) need their own planet! The, Germans, are NOT the REAL Nazis!

The schools cannot solve the problems, they are a system, a direct instruction model that works when parents educate the child and use the general scaffold of information imparted through memory ONLY as what the school can do and afford to do, as a means to aid in educating the child. Our problems in child development are because of the public school systems as they are by design. Children need mixed environments, not same age group, same general and watered down info memorized ONLY. Public schools are touted as by the public, but in reality they serve that very system we are realizing no longer works, they are that model in their inherent design.

People like to think of themselves as not needing "Free money" and can work on their own. People associate this mindset with "strength" and sufficiency. A life without meaning is not worth living and the first step toward meaning is having a base level of income. Money gives you no excuse to improve yourself with that mindset.
#####
Andrew Yang for President!
#####
From what I have gathered, he does want to reduce the costs of essential pharma products like insulin, epipens and the like to basically zero. With that said, he plans on attempting to open up the market at the highest level in order threaten big pharma/private healthcare companies. By allowing the private companies to continue to operate "business as usual", he would create new leverage to force deals that requires them to cooperate with proposals that they normally wouldn't consider. After that phase, he would stagnate the increase of costs, and collect a % of their profits to fund other programs, such as a form of medicare for all (more cost effective healthcare nearing zero dollars or extremely inexpensive to avoid a wild increase in taxes). Another use from such a powerful new source of funding would be treatment centers after the decriminalization of substance addiction/use. Its actually pretty genius, why shut down such a powerful economic source that is already a key valve in our monetary system. I would expand on this further (just theorizing), but I don't have a clue how much money would be involved or what new programs he has in mind otherwise.
#####
I don't agree with him on healthcare nor do I think it's the government's job to provide it, but I still want to see him become the Democratic nominee.
#####
props to MSNBC for finally giving Yang the airtime he deserves!
#####
So Yang does have a weakness. It's his weak approach to healthcare. Obama forced uninsured americans who couldn't afford healthcare to pay for crappy insurance or pay a fine at the end of the year for having no insurance. Yang sounds like that's similar to what he wants to do. Bernie Sanders has a better plan though I love Andrew Yang's other policies.
#####
i think having a co-pay so you have "some skin in the game" is a good thing, however I have patients who make decent money, but have larger families, support their parents and in-laws, and are really tight on funds. having a $25 - $45 co-pay for many may not seem like a big deal, but to some it is a wall between seeking treatment and not seeking treatment.  I would suggest the co-pay to be low enough that this will never be an issue, but high enough so that people don't go because they are bored, or have nothing better to do, maybe $5 comes to mind. 

Also, the problem with current medi-care is that the fee schedules are not realistic. It seems it is made out so that a private practice doctor cannot keep their doors open just taking medi-care rates (not managed medi-care, the true flat federal government rate). 

Now I get why the federal government would make it low, because doctors have other sources of income other than medi-care or medicaid patients. however once a medi-care for all system, or even a public option is available. unless the fee schedule is competative with for profit insurance companies, there is absolutely no way people will have "high quality care" when the doctor who is seeing them is basically doing it for charity.

thats not to say for profit insurances are saints, most of them do sneaky things to deny coverage, and partner with dodge 3rd party companies to lower pay-out to providers, often times to match the medi-care rate. 

it would be better to calculate a reasonable workload for a doctor, expected traffic in and out the office, and calculate a fee schedule that is appropriate, for example lets say your local doctor's office has 50k/year expenses due to rent, equipment utilities etc. and each doctor there works 40 hours a week, it is reasonable that he should make between 120 - 300k/year given his education. the receptionist should also make between 25 - 50k/year. this means maybe 300k for 40 hour work week for a year is reasonable. lets say the doctor seeks 8 patients per day, leaving room for paper work, and non-filled appointment slots and no-shows. this means a reasonable rate is $156/patient.
#####
Yang is pulling back on healthcare - why? He used to be M4A, then went for Public option, and after reading his recent plan in his website I don‚Äôt see how I will get healthcare. I don‚Äôt have healthcare. I can‚Äôt afford it. I am self employed. How would I get healthcare under Yang‚Äôs plan which are a complex set of ideas for reducing costs by pleading to those who control the industry.  This is one place where I think Yang isn‚Äôt making a sincere, big difference.
#####
One of the few Dem frontrunner who isn't a pure idealogue.  We need someone with logic, brains and compassion in the WH.  Yang is the only candidate with all three of those qualities IMO.  He's a longshot, but the alternatives are way worse.  Don't agree with him on UBI, but all his other ideas seem sound and pragmatic.  UBI is very unlikely to ever get anywhere on Congress so hopefully his supporters aren't single issue voters.
#####
why squeeze the private companies over time when you can do it right away with single payer?
#####
Chris Hayes saying Hi before an interview is a common courtesy #msbc #yang2020
#####
guys ...I'm a Canadian and now live in the states ...Medicare for all aka universal basic healthcare or whatever you wanna call it (it's freaking semantics ) doesn't necessarily cover everything ...that's why Canada still has private health insurance. ..particularly to cover dental ..vision ..physio ...and prescription drugs..

yang is letting private insurance stay there...if people realize the public option is better...they'll stop paying for private ...whether this happens depends how good the coverage is in terms of the public option but based on what I see from other countries ...the private sector needs to play a role as the govt can't cover everything ..even if it does in theory ..there will be limits to the coverage

Canada's prescription drug costs are second highest in the world (US is obviously first )...there's been discussion for a national pharmacare program but the govt is afraid it'll cost too much (one estimate is 15 billion for Canada's small population )...scale that to the US and add in the stronger resistance from big pharma in the US .....
#####
Bad look, Chris.  Bias showing.  Disappointing.
#####
So he doesn't believe in m4a
#####
I want to see these yang haters when yang actually becomes president but ik it would be unlikey.... it would still be nice to see these closeminded people crawling back to yang UBI ..... cause even when ppl criticise him about the UBI, Free money no strings attached is a thing everyone wants.....and u would be stupid if you actually don't get it.....

None of you YangGangers are even talking about the laughable garbage that spewed out of Yangs mouth in this interview. He does not support Medicare for all based on his actual website but using the terminology to win voters. It's incredibly disingenuous and gross.
#####
I love Andrew Yang!
#####
Cant beleive the litle time given to Andrew Yang in MSNBC.  Saaaaadddd.

The only reason this issue would ever be brought up again is that you have no other legitimate grievance on ANDREW YANGS platform to bring up. He has answered every question during his 14 hour marathon questioning, he spent an awfully amount of time on this issue alone.
#####
Cris, this issue has been answered during your media blackout. You member. This was fully explained by ANDREW YANG, member? You member. Autonomy and independent journalism is as American as apple pie. Get your boot off of our throats and put the money in our hands.

Bernie's medical for all will throw 2 million people off their jobs.https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/12/28/bernie-sanders-says-medicare-for-all-will-cost-jobs/  Bernie's plan to address the job loss is to have federal jobs retraining program and a federal jobs guarantee lol.  if you are a yang supporter.. you will just shake your head. There is no way the government can retrain 2 million people to get new careers. And additionally the government is terrible at running real businesses.. Healthcare.gov crashed within hours upon launch and had to be rebuilt by silicon valley. Obama had to throw out a bunch of red tape just so the specialist can come in and fix it.. And this is just a website. I don't trust bernie's plan to address the massive job losses that will come with his Medicare 4 all plan.

So disappointed in Yang. Please America, do not fall for this bait-and-switch. Yang is not for M4A. He is not for single payer. He supports private insurance, which is why your healthcare is so expensive. Keeping private insurance will push the sick onto the public plan, reduce bargaining power for the government to lower drug prices, and by and large, keep things the way that they are.

Honestly, the far left liberal media and personnel that smeared Andrew should be ashamed of themselves. I respect Bernie's plan that's trying to bring healthcare for all. But I also like Andrew's that try to achieve a similar goal in a different way and frankly, his plan is a lot more realistic to pass the Congress. If they don't like it, don't vote for him. There's no need to smear.  But it seems to me these attackers have a hidden agenda.

I really like Yang, but I do think he needs to make a clearer stance on health care.  While I think MSNBC has been absolutely shameful in their coverage of Yang, the health care questions from Chris Hayes seem valid to me.

so were done with Yang, right?
#####
andrew is lying. he is not for medicare for all. he is supposed to be a decent man with honest plans. this is such a blatant lie. he can say medicare public option and ubi instead of lying to people by saying medicare for all

Seems like MSNBC asked Andrew Yang on the show, just so they could trip him up, but he's too smart for that. Also, there is nothing to criticize him about. Instead, Chris Hayes comes out looking misinformed and confused; obviously not doing his research. What is really underhanded is when they could not make Andrew look bad in the interview, they had to bring these two talking heads to try and smear Yang. MSNBC did not upload this part of the clip. One of the heads, some white haired old guy, said that he thought those people standing behind Yang were his only black supporters.  I bet he knows by now how stupid that sounds!
#####
Yang is pretty darn clear here:  Public option and going toward universal coverage but without the large scale disruptions proposed by Bernie's single-provider for all proposal.
#####
This why Yang is not a good candidate. He wants to are time for private insurance companies to undermine Medicare for all. They will offer plans that seem competitive while introducing complexities and prior authorization for covered medical procedures. The goal, of course will be too undermine M4A.
#####
If it's not m4a then just state it.  No bait and switch.
#####
With an extra $1000 a month maybe i could actually afford private insurance.
#####
He isn‚Äôt for Medicare for All. I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt like him anymore

I wish Andrew Yang would simply call it "Single Payer Option with low deductibles and other cost reducing measures" to start out ... then,  if people are satisfied, they will start dropping (or reducing coverage) from their private plans.
#####
MSNBC SUCKS ONLY WATCH IF ANDREW YANG ON IT
#####
Chris you are confused because you are not smart enough and was paid to say so to mislead the audience, so audience are hearing confusion to Andrews policy, Andrews policy is loud and clear and you have to be very very dumb to not getting it!?

I feel bad for yang and bernie because they do not deserve to have a part of their fan base be so utterly obnoxious and hatefilled. Bernie would win if he would tell his nutters to act decent. Since he wont it reflects poorly on him. Same for yang who encourages it more than bernie.
#####
Makes sense to me
#####
Yang is correct about the response of some workers to the choice between benefits that they have spent years to obtain and government provided benefits, which may or may not be as good. I was exposed to this same problem when retirees were first offered Medicare in addition to their company retirement medical plan. The problem came when they were expected to pay additional amounts for Parts A & B. I had a lot of people asking me how they could get out of Medicare. Although I appreciate Yang's more flexible approach, I disagree with the concept of "skin in the game". Medical care delivered on a timely basis without regard to "saving up enough money to pay for the copay" on an MRI or an office visit is ultimately less expensive for the entire system. Diseases caught at an earlier stage of development can usually be handled more quickly and with less invasive methods. This National Health Care Plan is an issue that America should have addressed 50 years ago. Now that all of the other capitalist countries already have working plans, we can easily look and see what works for them. The Congress will ultimately design any plan that we end up with. Our new President can help to steer, but the details are worked out in Congress.

#####
HE MADE IT. :D
#####
This was a great segment. I‚Äôm amazed that FOX is reporting Andrew Yang in a more fair manner than these garbage  liberal news outlets. üò≥
#####
$1000 per mouth every American adult.... what a scam

That "long shot" delivers well thought ideas to advance America. I don't see the other Democratic candidates giving options that don't involve deflecting on to the current administration.
#####
And he did qualified. Yay!
#####
Andrew Yang! The next POTUS.
#####
Love Yang!!!!
#####
Bernie 2020
#####
He polled at 11% .
#####
YANG 2020!!!
#####
He‚Äôs the best candidate for ALL parties. Let‚Äôs get him into the White House!
#####
Fox is a joke.
#####
I love a good underdog tale.
#####
The reason why the US is dying is people stop caring about politics. Andrew brings hope and energy to politics like Obama did. He was in Obama administration. However, he is an entrepreneur, not a politician.
#####
Fox treating Yang fairly is a sign of how republicans and conservatives will vote for him more than any other democrat.
#####
Tulsi is like Yang's shield lol
#####
Yang 2020. Donate to Andrew Yang to help him reach 1 mil
#####
Yang yang 2020
#####
Thank you fox for covering Andrew Yang , msnbc won‚Äôt
#####
I am a former bernie bro. WE WANT MORE YANG. he is the future!!! Bernie 2.0 -- more forward thinking plans
#####
Yang is with Jack Ma?!  0:08
#####
I always believed in fox news!!!!!!! Yang 2020!!!

Do Maths, not drugs:


M - marijuana
A - alcohol
T - tobacco
H - heroin
S - salvia


See? By promoting thinking again by using MATHS... we can also help drug addicts find a better way to recover!

(Yang can say MATH if he wishes. However, I recognize MATHS as a plural.)
#####
100% for Yang, followed by Trump
#####
If only ...
Yang Can Cook
#####
I am not American but I understand his facts and he blasts truth and tells things as they are and how they could be. He unites both left and right in way that helps all prosper and alleviate the heavy symptoms and disturbing side effects of capitalism that it has. Its capitalism in a humane way that hasn't been tested widely but locally. Search his ideas and policies. They have been proposed by the world bank and a plethora of economic professionals old and new.

He's qualified baby!

Yang has already qualified for the December debate. üëçüëçüëç

Guess what before Jane Sanders bankrupted Burlington College. Carina her daughter was funneled students and money to Vermont Wood Working school she Co owne's with her husband. 500k in student money was embezzled off Burlington College. I wonder if Bernie will hug and support the victims of the sexist attacks his Bernie Bros did to citizens. So Bernie has lots of scumbag sneaky supporters. The kind of sociopaths that think they are immune and justified in their attacks. " Please show us on the Teddy bear where the bad Bernie Bro touched you " üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
#####
yang is the best shot we have to beat trump, all these other candidates are old tired and still trying to thrust us back into the 1980's, we wanna go forward and we;re going forward with yang
#####
yanggang lets go !!!!

I WAS THERE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
#####
Yang is the only future for America!!!!!!!!!!!
#####
Yang has qualified for the next debate. He's just going to keep rising in the polls.
#####
When Fox reports on Andrew Yang while MSNBC continues ignoring him. üß¢
#####
Find Jesus, he is the way the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father except by him. Jesus is our saviour he died on the cross and rose again for those who repent and turn from there sins believe in what he did at the cross and become born again. 
Nwo coming. If everyone is this excited for money to make it, imagine when the mark of the beast comes and all the world will bend at the knee in a heart beat for it.
#####
Texas Yang Gang was popping off at that rally. I feel really good about him winning this state if he can win NH or Ia
#####
It's cool that Yang is getting air time here but why in the world does Fox 4 have the audio quality of a 1994 local news station? Their video is fantastic, did they spend their whole budget on cameras and forget about mics?
#####
This video has aged well. Quinnipac 4% qualifier got him with 2 days to spare. What a maverick.
#####
And qualify he did!!! Go Yang, go!!
#####
Trump's rallies are 20 times larger than this gathering. It was cute though.  His followers look like the  typical libtard... Young,  dumb,  brainwashed and clueless how the world works.  Most still live in parents basement
#####
I was out of town past weekend but if he comes to Dallas next time I want to attend
#####
Hillary Clinton is definitely out of touch with america and laser beam focused on nuclear war along with the rest of the vile and desolate regime.
#####
Thankyou Fox for coverage
#####
The only thing that should matter is  if Yang has the better agenda than Trump to move America forward.  And I love the Yang Gang tag.
#####
GET. THAT. BAG.
#####
Wow this is crazy wonder if he will meet Jeremy Lin
#####
I have a feeling he‚Äôs polling way over 4%
#####
Fox reporting on Yang ??????
#####
More Andrew Yang News Please!!!
#####
Thank you for covering Andrew Yang!  Nice piece :)
#####
Uber driver in Dallas and pick someone up from the rally, not knowing Andrew was in town. I forgot to check my email, so I had no clue he was in. I was so pissed I didn't get to go, but one of the writers that I picked up gave me a "Humanity first" poster. Super grateful. But next time I'll be more diligent... üòÅ
#####
Yang yang2020 ‚úä we're gonna move foward with this man as president
#####
I live in texas I wish I could've gone to see himüò£üò£
#####
It's not left, it's not right, it's Forward! Yang Gang!
#####
I may not be from Iowa but I‚Äôll be voting for Andrew Yang
#####
Me, my dad and mom, and GRANDMOTHER are voting for him in Massachusetts!
#####
They may try to make him look small, but atleast they are giving him
Publicity guys. Thanks fox! I‚Äôm with Yang and Tulsi till the end.
#####
YANG GANG IS POWERFUL
#####
Where do we go to represent yang in the polls?
#####
WE CAN HAVE A NEW AMERICAN RENAISSANCE
#####
Yang is the only man who‚Äôs made me excited about politics in a decade!! I hate how the media portrays his supporters as a solely online troll community. Online is the future and we‚Äôre punished for understanding the system and supporting our dude.
#####
Yang Gang 2020 ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
#####
He's still running?  Longest touring standup comic ever.  They're taking him seriously.
#####
Yang qualified for the Dec debates btw.
#####
‚ÄúSmall rally???‚Äù 
It was huge. How big are other rallies?
These people are trying real hard to make him look like a joke. What a bunch of assholes.
#####
he is good . but inexperienced. he would be a good pick for vice president for any winning democractic nominee ( hopefull bernie) . but in the future he should definitely try again ..
#####
Very nice coverage of the campaign.
#####
I think he's the best cabdidate for the Dem.
By the way, why am i watching this? I'm not even american.
#####
Feel the Yang!
#####
I hope in the next debate he mentions his name being left out of polls and if people want to make it happen vote for it . its the only way forward.
#####
Great report! Go Fox and Yang!
#####
Everyone is Yang Gang, they just don't know it yet.
#####
For all the Yang Gang Bangs if you think your rally is big, go watch Trump rallies. That's what you call BIG rally.
#####
if Andrew Yang didn‚Äôt win democratic nominee , So I blame Media, because of  MSNBC we must support Yang2020  or Trump 2020.
#####
Aww man I missed it
#####
WEWWW YANG GANG At the end of the video is life
#####
Wang gang
#####
Yang 2020 üòò
#####
Main Stream Media and the Execs who own them and the Cabal that they take orders from are truly the enemy of the People of The United States.
#####
The only people who turn out for Joe Biden Rally are MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post, ABC, CBS, Bloomberg, Newsweek, Huffpo, Bo Biden and Ukrainian Gas Execs and Ukrainian Mafia
#####
Thats thousands of people that turn out for a Joe Biden Rally.
#####
Yang is going to upend the whole system. Buckle Yang Gang!

TEXAS IS NOW A BATTLE GROUND STATE... TEXAS COULD ACTUALLY GO BLUE IN 2020
